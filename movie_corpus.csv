UNBOXING:

The game is a standard Xbox CD and  comes in a clamshell that only has two pamphlets.  Neither one tells you how to play.

GAMEPLAY:

The game is very detail oriented, and replicates a virtual Disneyland to a tee.  However, the controlling of the avatars is a PAIN IN THE @$$!  The game will often drop the player for no reason.  When coming back into the game, you need to wave frantically and it doesn't always (mostly never) pick you up again.  Then when you get back in the game, your avatar randomly changes: from boy to girl and vice versa, and from race to race.

There's a little ticket avatar that tells you the basics of movement: essentially hold your hand out to go directions forward, left and right.  Wave to interact with other avatars.  Hands in the air to take a picture.  But that's it.  As far as how to play any of the games, there are no instructions.

PROS:

- It's Disneyland!
- Voice overs sound like Disney Character cartoons

CONS:

- Controlability (BIG CON)
- No instructions

OVERALL:

This game IS NOT for anyone under the age of 10.  All of my kids cannot play this game because of the glitches in the contolling avatars.  They all gave up within 5-10 minutes of playing.

I got this for about $15, so it's a lesson in what not to buy.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND this video game.  Stick with winners like Kinect Sports and Kinectimals.",Disney Missed the Boat with This One!,1356393600,3,,

1.0,False,"06 19, 2011",A1S4TVC7TD4GYU,B00140P9BA,Vishal Kasliwal,"There are several things wrong with this game
Squad AI and enemy AI: This basically kills the game. The squad AI is so bad, the squad is a liability rather than an asset. Squad members will run out in front of you and block your shot, refuse to stay put when you tell them too, refuse to maintain distance and will therefore attract splash damage to you because they run up next to you, stand out in the open and just shoot away. The way the controls are set up, squad-mates are unnecessarily hard to issue orders to. For example, the game forces you to use a 'Biotic' power to destroy certain enemies. If you're a soldier you don't have access to these powers, so you have to use a squad-mate. To do so, you must have line of sight to the enemy that you want your squad-mate to destroy. WHY? How does this make any sense whatsoever? Why not just let the player switch control between characters like most RPGs of the 'recruit your squad-mates' variety do? Enemy AI is very primitive. While they us cover, it's very sparingly and they never do anything other than hold position or duck and weave between different cover. No grenade usage, no assault, nothing. BORING!
Sticky walls: ME1 decided to go with the '3rd person shooter duck and lean' system popularized by Gears of War. While it may work well on a console, here it's just annoying - you repeatedly stick to any bit of wall that you run into and un-sticking yourself is not smooth but you sort of have to pull yourself away. It's very annoying.
The Car & Mineral Collection: It's no fun to drive (in fact, it drives terribly and is very very aggravating) and they turn resource collection into a boring drive across empty terrain. If you don't do this, you can't buy the good stuff. So you just have to explore scores of worlds, driving across maps to find minerals. It's all very irritating and boring after the first time. The fact that this has to be done many many times made me decide to drop the game and stop playing it.
The BIOWARE recipe: Here's how it works - reveal a terrible calamity to the player. Have him move around the world collecting companions and harvesting resources by giving him boring, semi generic missions (the missions are basically identical between games. Try playing Dragon Age & KOTOR 1 alongside ME1 and you'll see what I mean). When he becomes Uber Powerful, lock him into a channeled sequence of events which culminates in him killing the boss in a (usually boring and repetitive shoot out so many body parts type) boss fight. We went there and did that with KOTOR 1 & 2, Dragon Age 1 & 2 and I hope by now people realize just how absolutely standardized all Bioware games are and how ME 1 stays true to this generic pattern.

I'll break it down for you.

The Razer Naga Molten looks really cool, and the buttons are super useful, while it worked I UTTERLY loved the thing, being able to macro things to it, change the polling rate, and go back and forth on the internet between pages with the side buttons was wonderful.

But it fell off my desk onto soft carpet, less than 3 feet and it felt like a large chunk was rattling around inside, I was like ok, no problem!
I could still use it even though now it felt really junky and cheap, but then the left and right mouse buttons started to fail, I would click them and they'd become unresponsive, then eventually they started to stick, over time it started ghosting all over, that's when I took a demolition hammer to it and decided to never buy this brand again.

You may get lucky and get one that last's forever, but it seems like it's a hit or miss, it's too much money in my opinion to throw into a hole only to have the thing die from standard gaming use or a super super light fall, could I have gotten a replacement and tried again? sure, but I'm not down like that, if I spend this much money and you do me like this you're through with me, NO APOLOGIZES OR POLITICAL CORRECTNESS, there is just simply better gear out there and I'm not wasting my time with kit that's going down so easy for such a silly price point.

Resident Evil is another example of how you can make a games, which looks great graphically, but is barely playable in terms of controls.

To begin with, just to start the game you have to push the following sequence of buttons (or, more like ""push the same button so many times""): Start, X, X , X, X, X, Down, Down, X, X... Are you freaking kidding me???

And it's the same throughout the game: every time you need to go to a next Act, or to restart a game because you got killed, it's a miriad of X pushes. Even to upgrade a weapon you have to push X to select the upgrade, then confirm Upgrade by pushing X again, then confirm the confirmation by pushing X again, then when it's upgraded you have to push X yet again to the message that the upgrade has been installed. HOLY COW!!! Who in the hell did come up with this stupidity???

Now, I don't know why it was even considered as an option, let alone the ONLY option available, to completely STOP a player in his/her place to shoot and even to reload a gun. But it does seem like every playable character in the game is a complete idiot, unable to handle more than one task at a time: you can either move, or you can shoot, or you can reload your gun, but never the combination of moving and one of the other two.

Aiming is also weird: while you're rooted in place, you have to find where in the hell the laser line ends, which is nearly impossible without a full (stereo) 3D, because you can't really tell how far it ends, because it can be pretty much anywhere on the screen (not centered as in the majority of games where you have to aim).

The control scheme is the worst of all games in the world. I've complained on bad controls in other games, of course, but nothing comes close to RE5 in this regard: I doubt you can come up with the worst controls for decades to come.

As far as the storyline is concerned - it's japanese, so it's all ridiculously cheesy and convoluted, just like pretty much all other japanese games that managed to reach the West. I know some people might like it, so take this as my personal opinion :)

All in all, the controls completely ruined the game for me. The graphics are amazing (although the PS3 version, as usual, have gotten a shorter end of a stick, with jaggies appearing/disappearing all the time because of the ""dynamic"" antialiasing, framerate drops, which also causes control lagginess, and many other graphical compromises here and there that have already been mentioned by the [...] reviewers.",Nothing amazing and nothing  new,1236902400,9,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The guns are the worst actually. When you shoot 6 bullets with a gun, mabye 5, your girl looks at the roof. She cannot hold a gun straight. The target practice is basically 3 targets going directly upward. I mean seriously, this chick is an operative, and the recoil on her gun actually has her looking towards the roof in 6 shots or less.

Red Dead Redemption has incredible graphics and fantastic audio, which adds up to create an unparalleled atmosphere that makes you feel like you're really in the wild west.  But the missions and story are mostly boring and forgettable, with pointless side quests, and glitches horrible enough to essentially ruin the game.

Long Review:

Note:  This review is spoiler free with regards to the game's story.

Having all but conquered city based free roaming games, it's no surprise that Rockstar would eventually brand out to try and allow players to conquer other areas, this time taking us back to the turn of the century Wild West, essentially creating Grand Theft Horse.  Instead of fast motorcycles and flashy cars, you have horses and stagecoaches.  And while it sounds like an awesome and unique idea, we get an end product that's very pretty and incredibly atmospheric, but is packed with boring missions and glitches so severe, it at times ruins the game completely.

Red Dead Redemption follows former outlaw John Marston as he heads across the lands of New Austin, the last holdout of the wild west on the Mexican border.  His mission is simple:  His lovely wife and young son have been kidnapped and held hostage by the government, and if he wants to get them back and get a clean break from his former life, he has to hunt down and take out the members of his old gang.

Taking on the role of John, you run around in a massive open ended world where you can go virtually anywhere you want to.  Every western cliche is here, including ramshackle old frontier towns, cactus, giant stone monoliths, forests filled with bears, adobe houses, and even tumbleweeds.  Like every other free roam game, you run around this world to find missions to complete, and thus advance the story.  It's an incredibly beautiful world, as unlike Liberty/Vice/Stilwater city, there are no skyscrapers, no malls, or giant buildings.  Everything here is turn of the century technology, with the biggest building being only two stories tall.  As a result, the world feels massive and virtually endless.  You feel like a tiny ant in the middle of a very large and untamed world, and gives the game an epic feel that very few games can match.

However, Red Dead Redemption has the huge problem of feeling mostly pointless.  Almost all the missions follow this pattern:

1.  Get on a horse and ride halfway across the map with a partner.
2.  Listen to said partner deliver expositional dialogue to advance the plot.
3.  Reach destination.
4.  Kill everyone.
5.  Watch as partner rides off, abandoning you.
6.  Spend several minutes riding to the other side of the map to get your next mission, grumbling at how slow you're going.

As a result, most of the missions are very forgettable.  There are a few exceptions, such as fort assaults, boat rides, etc. but for the most part, the missions do very little to distinguish themselves.  As a result, it feels like you're just slogging through mission after mission, wondering when things are going to get interesting.  Thankfully, the third act of the game does reverse this trend, as there are a few creative and clever missions that are interesting to play through, but it's essentially too little, too late.

Outside of the story, there are a good amount of side missions, where you can become a bounty hunter and track down criminals, help random strangers out, go hunting for treasure, collect flowers, hunt animals, etc. but after a while, I realized that these quests are, in effect, pointless.  You mainly get money and fame/honor for doing them, but you get plenty of money from the story missions, and the fame/honor has barely any effect on the gameplay in general.  You can unlock rewards (such as riding stagecoaches for free), but it takes a long time to do so, and is not worth the effort.  I personally stopped doing all the diversions and side missions halfway through the game, because it felt like a waste of time.

Red Dead's story, like the missions, moves at a near glacial pace.  While the core story will make you want to keep going to find out if John rescues his family or not, it takes forever to get there.  The story contains a ton of fat that could be cut out, from characters who add nothing to the main plot, to virtually everything in Mexico, which has little to no impact on the main story.  It isn't until the third act that there's a sense of real danger and threat, and the drama picks up.  However, it's made worse by the fact that Red Dead makes one of THE worst mistakes a story can make...after the climax, it just doesn't end.  You feel like you've reached the end of the game, only to find that it keeps going and going and going and going.  After an hour of playing pointless, tutorial like missions, I lost my patience and wondered when the hell the game was going to end.  As a result, when the ending FINALLY came, I didn't care at all about what happened.

Then there's the game's many bugs and glitches:  If you hunt around on the internet, you'll come across humorous videos of people flying like birds, midgets acting like cougars, talking coyotes, etc.  However, those videos don't tell you about some of the other, more infuriating bugs.  Among the ones I experienced:

*In one mission, I assisted a group of people in taking over a fortress.  Afterwards, I went exploring and opened a standard chest to get some money.  Then an informant was running away from me, and seconds later, I was wanted for...something, and EVERYONE I had just helped to infiltrate the fortress was trying to kill me.
*Half my inventory would randomly vanish, ruining hours of hunting and searching for goods.
*I save a woman from being raped, and kill her captor.  A guy starts shooting at me, so I kill him in self defense.  For some reason, my honor goes down.
*I rent a room (AKA save/respawn point) in a new town, get involved in a duel and get killed, and get respawned several miles away in some OTHER town.
*John is being attacked by wolves.  I aim and pull the trigger, but John refuses to shoot his fully loaded gun and is torn to shreds.
*I run through a town, when the sheriff, for no reason whatsoever, shoots and kills me.
*The game crashes, making me loose most of my progress.

It's sad really...my first impressions of Red Dead Redemption were fantastic, but the more and more I played, I realized I just wasn't having any fun, and was starting to despise the game for how slow it was going, and how so many things felt pointless and annoying.  Add in how short and badly done the tutorials are (they appear on screen for about fifteen seconds, then vanish, often taking place in real time), John's annoying personality (he acts like Forrest Gump in a cowboy outfit, and I got the impression he was mildly retarded), and with the glitches, my annoyance turned to disgust.

In the end, while Red Dead Redemption is incredibly beautiful and very atmospheric, the story needs much editing and trimming, the missions are forgettable, the annoying characters will get on your nerves, the ending goes on longer then ""The Return of the King"" and the glitches will annoy you to no end.  I personally think Red Dead Redemption is yet another over-hyped game that turns out to be, at best, mediocre, and at worst, infuriating.","Very pretty, but as empty and hollow as a wasteland",1282867200,61,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

 The single player story mode has to be played through in order to get anything unlocked in the main game. The story mode defines suffering. The quests are repetitive and obnoxious, and the block/dodge button is completely unresponsive... in fact the whole combat system is bloody unresponsive! This game has so many annoying quirks it makes me wonder how EA (normally a company known for at least moderate quality) could have allowed this catastrophe to be unleashed upon unsuspecting Marvel fans.

 People, if it's Marvel you want pick up Marvel Vs Capcom 2 it remains the best Marvel fight to date. Marvel Nemesis is worse than the X-Men Mutant Academy/Next Dimension series; it's an absolute abomination despite its excellent story and amazingly detailed characters. Its game play is simply put unplayable. I have not had a game get me this angry in like... ever. It would behoove EA to have at least put a difficulty setting option for the story mode, as getting through the story mode features no gradual increase in difficulty as you become acquainted with the new characters, it simply goes from ridiculously easy with the Thing to absolutely impossible with Daredevil. Unless you enjoy masochism DO NOT rent, and DO NOT buy this piece of garbage. I'm trading mine in tomorrow toward something else. I hope I never hear the words Marvel Nemesis again.

Realistic.  Great graphics.  Great sound effects.  Large boards.  Lots of players.  Lots of servers.  Gameplay is not the real issue you need to be concerned with when deciding whether or not to purchase this game.

I have owned the game for a long time now.  Since the very beginning the game has been plagued with glitches, reports of crashes, blue screens of death, black screens of death, and so on.  There are now thousands of players posting online about their inability to play a game they paid top dollar for upon release.  I am now one of those players.  With every update, the game adds quite a few players to the ""cannot play list.""  The worst part is not the fact that players are encountering all kinds of game crashes.  Some that require manual reboots.  Some that do not allow you to play at all.  The worst part is that the game's manufacturers do not offer any assistance.  They have an outsourced Indian help group that honestly tries hard, but they do not know anything the casual gamer knows about Battlefield 3.  Pretty pathetic.  They give advice like, clear your cookies, or restart your pc, or disable your sound.  Really poor advice that often leads to strings of idiotic ideas that have actually caused gamers to lose pc functionality in many ways.  We--me and thousands of others--have pleaded with EA and DICE for help.  We hear nothing in reply.  All of us get an Indian help agency that is unfamiliar with the game itself.  Not to mention that they are feeding us scripted passages and instructions.  When they attempt to speak to us normally, it is often gibberish.

Do a quick search about BF3 screens of death, for example.  You will see that this company does not care about its customers.  Months have gone by without a word from these people.  To anyone.  They have our money; that is all they care about.

They are a horrible company at heart, but they have produced a pretty fun game.  Once you experience the game and have to give it up because of these programming mistakes, you feel even worse than if you had never bought the game.  So, my advice is to buy it on a console or do not buy it at all.  Yes, the pc version is incredibly superior to the console versions, but what choice do we have?  If you do purchase this game, you will most likely end up as one of the people who cannot play anymore.  I will update if things change.  Don't hold your cyber breadth.

First off, this is an extremely short game. It plays about 2 hours or so with no replay value.

Gameplay:
The AI is horrible, you run through linear maps through 8 missions, and there isn't too much to it. Expect most of the enemies to have their backs to you so you can easily kill them, expect no sound detection for the stealth so you can run around behind an enemy and he won't even notice, and expect to miss most of the shots you shoot given the shot detection is flawed. It's frustrating to play this game.

Multiplayer Gameplay:
The multiplay gameplay is horrid. You can only really play deathmatch and given how horrid this game is you can't even find people to really play with.

Graphics:
Horrible outdated graphics only add insult to injury.

Sound:
The main character curses (a lot) but besides that nothing is too great about this game.

Seriously, this game is horrible. Please at the very least consider checking review sites before buying anyone this as a gift.

I seriously don't think that they tested this game.

I saw this game for $10 at a video game store. Growing up with Sonic The Hedgehog since the Sega Genesis, I thought this would be nice to play. The intro video had nice visuals, even though the plot is pretty much Mario (save the princess). But once the game started, the disappointment came with it. I don't start out in a level?! I have to run (and WOW is he slow!) around Italy for half an hour trying to figure out what to do??? I need to help people do pointless activities?? And the loading is HORRIBLE!! Every time you start a sidequest (I guess you could call it that), you talk to the person and they tell you what to do. The game loads for about 15 seconds (literally), which sounds short, but WHY?!?! Then the person tells you exactly what they just told you, but in one sentence... THEN IT LOADS AGAIN!! For another 15 seconds! Then the sidequest starts. Each loading sequence is approximately 15 seconds. If you fail this sidequest, you have to load, talk to the person again, load, they tell you exactly what they just told you, load, and THEN you can try the sidequest again! If you beat the sidequest, what do you know, it loads. And once you finally play an actual level, you will see the horror of the glitches. At SO many points in the game I would jump and fall through the ground... and die. Sometimes you'll just be running toward a ramp, and Sonic won't run up it, he will go right through it and fall to his death.
One of the playable characters is Silver, who is actually pretty cool. He has telekinesis. You can fling cars, boxes, and rocks! But if you don't have any throwable objects around you, the only way to destroy an enemy is to stand about 3 feet from it, stun it, then lift it. Why do you have to stand so close!? By then, you've already been shot 50 times! In the cutscenes, you'll see Silver flying around at 200mph! In the game, he can hover for 5 seconds, at about 10mph. And man is he slow! It's like a slow jog! A little kid could run faster than him! I'm gonna go crazy writing this review so I'm gonna have to end it. The one SINGLE good thing about this game is the main theme. His World by Zebrahead. The song is just awesome in every way. And co-op missions, and 2 player race is kinda fun, but definitely not worth it.

I'm a huge fan of these games. there have been a few missteps during recent years, but 2K13 and 2K14 pretty much nailed it - these games had everything that make this genre great - Lots of match types, cool 'storyline' modes and best of all, a super detailed create a character mode that let you make a reasonable version of damn near anybody, and trade them online.  So when I finally upgraded to current gen, I thought this purchase would be a slam dunk. I have never been so wrong about a game...

I guess it's my own fault for not beleiving the bad reviews. I love the old AKI/N64 control schemes and playstyle, and for the most part people who play these games these days seem to champion the dumbed down PS1 'smackdown' type games, so I felt like I couldn't rely on reviews.

But seriously, This game is completely worthless. 2K absolutely GUTTED everything that was great about the last 4 versions of this game!  First, they shouldn't even legally be able to list a character creator in the product description of this game... It is the most limited I have ever seen.  No real create a move set, and about 10% of the options that were in the last game.

The gameplay is just awful.. EVERY grapple is settled by a ridiculous rock/paper/scissors quick time event that kills the flow of a match.  Reversal timing (which has been one of the admittedly weak aspects of the previous versions) is near impossible in this game.  And a completely useless 'momentum' meter which guarantees that no matter how much you beat down an opponent, they will come back at the last minute.

If somehow these glaring, horrible problems aren't enough to make you hate this game, the ridiculously long loading times between every single menu transition / view of a creation option will probably be the last straw.

I just cannot understand how a product takes such a bizzare change of direction / nosedive in quality after so many years of refinement and improvement..

I have always been a PC gamer and have stuck with it through the hardest of times both for me and for PC gaming itself. I enjoyed Borderlands 2, I thought it had some enjoyable coop but I quickly realized how the majority of fun came from the fact that I was playing with friends, not necessarily the game play.

This is not to say Borderlands 1 or 2 are bad games, they do what they set out to do well, and because of that I had faith that Gearbox would deliver at least a semi-decent product, but this game is one of the most shameful displays of a 2013 entertainment product that we will likely see all year. I actually went into this game expecting it to not be that great and I was still completely and utterly let down. I am also a pretty big Left 4 Dead fan and have 500 hours between both games clocked on my Steam account, Aliens Colonial Marines takes a few pages from L4D and shoves them into a lifeless, shell of a game.

This game alienated so many fans away from Mortal Kombat that many of us did not even bother playing MK4.  If not for Deadly Alliance resurrecting the franchise I would have never bothered playing another MK game because of MK3.

The AI in MK3 for the SNES is cheap beyond compare with the computer knowing your movements and commands and countering before you have a chance to respond.  The run button is a new feature and speeds up the gameplay but not in a good way against the computer. The AI seems to go from easy to extremely hard every time you move up the ladder to a next opponent. there is little strategy the player can use besides picking the following 3 characters Cyrax, Sub Zero and Jax and cheaping the computer to death with the same move over and over.

When you battle against Lui Kang, Kung Loa, Sheeva or Kabal the computer AI never screws up or misses on those 7 or 8 hit combos so half your life bar will be down to nothing without even a chance to fight back.  The game sorely needed a combo breaker like Killer Instinct had.  The endless throwing in the game is another irritating feature.  It was put in to stop turtling aka (using the crouching block) supposedly to speed up gameplay but used as another cheap attack .

I so want to give this game a 2 star rating because it is a Mortal Kombat game full of characters we all know and like but I just can't.  Because the game is just that bad. I would not want any buyer out there to waste there time playing this.  MK3 is the black sheep of all the Mortal Kombat games.  This game is only good on the 2 player option playing against your friends it holds the lowest replay value in the whole series of MK on the SNES.  Yes even the severely handicapped first game is better than this game.

I totally agree with the other reviewers that said the backgrounds were lame and uninspiring.  What's worse is this game has some level loop glitch that keeps players in the same 3 stages if you or your opponent uppercut you through the floor to the street level.  Play the game a few times and you will see what I mean.

Also MK3 on the SNES did not fix the only weakness on MK2 which was a credit limit of 5.  It is supposed to be like the arcade.  What is this credit BS. This is where SF2 always got it right by not limiting continues.  I know you can do a long code to get 30 credits but you should not have to. It is another irritating feature you should not have to deal with making the game that much more frustrating.  If you are going to limit continues what's the point of the difficulty option.

Finally the bosses and endurance rounds.  I liked the challenge of the endurance rounds but in a game already this cheap it is unnecessary.  Motaro just pisses you off rather than inspire you to keep fighting him.  Kintaro in MK2 was a great sub boss and anytime I lost to him I felt like I had a chance, and that I will destroy him in the next round.  But not against Motaro throwing endless fireballs at you after you are already dead its like he is giving you the bird literally.  Shoa Kahn is pretty much the same besides the big hammer and vertical knee his stage is so blah though that is the best they could come up with.

The creators at Midway also did not even bother putting in the original ending shots for each character just text of what was said.  That right there is just lazy.

So in conclusion don't waste your time on this game.  The only MK game on the SNES worth playing was 2.

I plugged in the device, but still received no indication that the controller was getting powered.

They didn't have the game (mostly) ""fixed"" for at least a month after the retail release.  That's unacceptable and insulting to paying customers.  I know Ubisoft can release a good game, but if the trend is to alpha/beta test on paying customers to meet some release deadline, I'm out.

Correction, I CANNOT FINISH NUKA-WORLD DLC due to a game breaking glitch that has yet to be patched even 21 days after release. During the quest ""Grand Tour"" you are required to speak with one of the NPCs, who keeps repeating the same line over and over again. Tried multiple suggestions on how to resolve this error and I have yet to get past it. Only thing I can do is reload a game save from 50 hours ago and play it a specific way to work around this idiotic bug. Reminds me of the Preston Garvey glitch that still HAS NOT been fixed after nearly a year of release. Clearly, Bethesda does not have it's priorities straight.

UPDATE 09/09/16: Any one looking to buy this game should purchase it for Xbox One or PC due to Sony withholding mods for the PS4 for unmentionable reasons. The same goes for the newly mastered Skyrim coming out this fall. From now on, all Bethesda games will be on my Xbox One!

Don't get me wrong, I love the Fallout franchise. I loved the original series and I love the reinvention of Fallout by Bethesda. I've spent over 280 hours on Fallout 4, completing every mission and having multiple branching paths saved for the different factions in the game. I've spent a ton of time with each companion and am idolized by each one. Currently, I am at level 121 and about to venture into Nuka World.. I spent nearly 15 hours building a better Sanctuary with the release of Wasteland Workshop and another 30 hours building and remodeling my Vault 88. I own both the Xbox One and PS4 Pip-Boy Editions (still sealed) and a regular copy of the game for PS4. I have a corner of my Nerd Cave devoted strictly to the Fallout franchise, including bobbleheads, figures and posters... So why 3 stars?

First and foremost are the numerous bugs and glitches that ruin the game for me and countless others. The minor bugs can be irritating at best, but are inexplicably, after nearly a year, still unresolved. Tina De Luca won't join my settlement even after fulfilling her requests and we just share a moment of awkward silence together as I stare blankly into her eyes. Oh, so Maxson wants to have an important conversation regarding one of my friends, but instead wanders aimlessly toward the wilderness, still talking, and then attacking some mongrels. He eventually kills my buddy even with a successful speech check... Companions get stuck during settlement building, or disappear altogether while exploring a dungeon. That's not even the worst of it...

I spent hours finding The Scribe and have finally done so successfully... However, having Automaton installed reduced my chances on the encounter and he still randomly decides to wander off on occasion. Why? I spent many more hours trying to find Smiling Larry, with NO success. Apparently, having Automaton installed basically reduces the chances to 0%. Why? I was assigned a quest by one of my settlers in Far Harbor to find a Legendary Fog Crawler and subsequently spent hours scouring the entire island to find him... WITH NO SUCCESS. Why?

The answer is in the development DLC content. While, I thoroughly enjoy building and workshops, I wonder why less time was devoted to developing some meaty story driven DLC? Not only was Fallout 4 one of the best selling Bethesda games, it was one of the best selling games of 2015... It sold $750 million dollars at launch if I recall correctly. Bethesda wanted to reward players by making amazing DLC, raising the price of the Season Pass to $50 in order compensate for the amount of DLC to be released. Yet, the DLC itself is marred by more bugs and odd glitches. The workshop DLCs should have been cheaper or included with some of the ""bigger"" DLC. Rather than spending resources fixing known issues with the vanilla game and/or the DLC, Bethesda has opted to spend most of their resources on the DLC. I hope, with Nuka World's release, that they will patch some of the issues present in the game, but until then, this game only deserves 3 stars.",Beautiful game with glitches and bugs galore...

You start out the game with two playable characters: Wolverine and the Human Torch.  You can unlock several other characters but it will require battle points.  You earn battle points by killing, killing & killing (as fast as possible).  The fighting environments are highly destructable, but more often that I'd care to mention, you'll find walls and floor simply disappear- the sprites are terrible & many times your character will be left simply standing in thin air.  The character animations themselves are shoddy- terribly choppy frame rate.

The cut-scenes in-between fights contain grammatically incorrect text.

I can't say anything positive about the fight mechanics either as the collision detection is horrendous.

In Sum:

Animations are choppy.

Sound is nothing bad/good, merely passable.

Fun factor is non-existent.

Control is wonky.

Since then I have been unable to play the game despite several calls to Xbox support. On my most recent call I was told they could do nothing and I would have to call Activision... Yeah right. After finding their support number (an incredible task) I was unable to reach anyone and after clicking through several automated things you generally get a blurb of advice from the automated tech line and hung up on.

My issues was this: First the update would not download. I got to 97% and nothing - 6 hours later - still nothing. 1st call to Xbox support... we restart everything (Xbox, router, etc...). Nothing. We uninstall the game - reinstall and try the update. Same results. Since this took several hours and the course of the day I obviously had to get off the phone with them. Therefore with nothing to do I tried this twice more. On the third attempt it worked. Hallelujah! I played the game for about 10 mins then had to go to bed - work the next day.

I get home today thinking, wow long day my homework is all done (I work and go to school online) I'll play some COD. I turn on the Xbox and bam - it wants to update again. Ok, small new patch maybe? Nope it wants to download the 1100MB patch from the previous day all over again. And now I'm back to begining. It stops at 97% again....

So I am now over $650 into a product I can't even use. Furthermore I can't get in touch with Activision support. At no point in my life have I ever been so angry at a manufacturer.

Also if I hadn't mentioned I am currently in Basrah, Iraq - not really a lot to do here so I thought the one small thing I could bring with me to mentally remove myself from this place for a few minutes everyday would be a simple video game, little did I know it would cause more stress than the insurgency within the country.

If you don't, avoid this game like the  plague.

I've never picked up an entry in the long-running Mario and Sonic Do A Sport Thing series, and for good reason. They've always kind of looked like kids' games. Not that there's anything wrong with that, mind you. There's always a place for kids' games. I mean, heck, Mario and Sonic's series are both basically for kids. It's just that they're generally good games, so anybody can enjoy them. But the Mario and Sonic Hit The Gym Jamboree franchise always looked like a certain type of kids' game. The kind of kids game full of trite mini-games, no depth, no content, and no reason to actually exist. But I guess, as somebody who likes Mario and loves Sonic, I was destined to cross paths in one way or another with one of these games. So why not this one?

Why not this one? Because Mario and Sonic's Rootin' Scootin' Way Past Cool 2016 Rio Olympic Games is one of the most fundamentally awful video games I've ever had the displeasure of suffering through. No, really. That's not a joke. I'm not just being harsh on a children's game. This is actually one of the most fundamentally garbage games on the 3DS, or any console for that matter. It may even be the worst game I've played that has Mario or Sonic in it. Think about that for a second. Worse that Mario Is Missing or Hotel Mario. Worse than Sonic Labyrinth or Sonic R. Think about that. Let it sink in. Done?

I'm not even sure where to begin with this one, folks. For starters, let's talk about the main brunt of the game: the story mode. Path to the Games? Road to the Gold? I don't know what it's called, I got rid of the thing over the weekend, but it was something like that. You pick a Mii, you choose a side, you do a ton of mini-games, you beat another mini-game, you buy a costume so you can do another mini-game, then you win that mini-game. After you win enough mini-games, you get to go to another map. Guess what you do on that map? You play. More. Freaking. Mini-games. That's it. That's all there is to it.

It doesn't matter if you side with Team Mario or Team Sonic, because you're going to have to do practically the same things. It just depends on which shallow interpretation of characters you want to spend multiple hours of your life talking to. Do you want to talk to princesses and turtles, or do you want to live out a DeviantArt member's wild furry fantasy? Your call. But honestly, they might as well be called Team Garbage or Team Bunghole, because they both stink. Not to mention the fact that it's basically the same mode as that really bad Mario Golf that hit the 3DS a few years back. Just a longer, and with more artificial difficulty. Because if there was one thing I wanted more of from Mario Golf, it was playing as a stupid Mii.

I would go into the mini-games specific to the story, and how bad they are, but I'll go straight into talking about the gameplay overall: it's awful. The Rhythmic Gymnastics is the exact gameplay as Hatsune Miku Project Diva DX, except with about three songs. The BMX requires rapid mashing of a button and feels like carpal tunnel waiting to happen as opposed to fun BMX racing. None of the touch screen games are close to responsive and are more likely to damage your screen and nerves than be fun. Golf, freaking golf is somehow messed up, thanks to the developers having the bright idea to use the touch screen to play. Soccer, one of the big draws, is awful, thanks to wonky controls and broken AI. There are probably over twenty events on display here. I played them all. None of them are fun. No, really. None. Zip. Zilch. They're all awful, and you'll feel awful if you play them. I mean, the horse-riding one is kind of neat, I guess. Maybe. But... there's like one track. That's it. Same with everything here.

And the sad thing is, there are two versions of each event. The ""real"" version, and the version that's a whacked-out fantasy one. They all basically play the same, though, and not even dumb garbage happening on screen can make any of this ice pick to the skull of a game fun. It's just a non-stop soap enema in game form, no matter which mode you choose. It's a sudsy enema distilled onto a tiny cartridge and foisted upon unsuspecting children. And by the time you realize what you've given those children, it's too late. The bubble bath enema has already been delivered. Mario and Sonic Give Out Soap Enemas. That would have been a better title for this one.

Oh, I guess I should talk about the visuals, but really, why? They just make me upset. A lot of time has been put into some great renders of characters we don't get to see enough of. Like, I really want to see more of Princess Daisy, or Blaze the Cat, or Waluigi. But not like this. I've been wanting the Sonic series to put more of the supporting cast in the games for years, but... not like this. Not in this barren wasteland of a soulless husk of a mini-game enema collection masquerading as children's entertainment. It's like watching Charles Bronson in the last Death Wish movie. You just feel bad. You know they don't want to be there, but the cruel hands of developers manipulate them like puppets, contorting them into sportsball-related poses for the sake of a few quick bucks. They're pimps. Video game pimps. And these visuals? They're basically furry prostitution. You can quote me on that.

Nothing about Mario and Sonic at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games is good. The visuals are depressing. The gameplay is busted. The amount of content feels like a threat as opposed to a selling point. It's just a sad carnival of cringe that makes me think of everyone involved differently. And after I spent a while with it and played another game, I realized that a pixel on my New 3DS, barely three months old, had died.

That means that, no matter what, no matter what I play, no matter how many years pass, this game has left a permanent mark on my life.

Don't let Mario and Sonic at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games ruin your life, too. And don't let it ruin the lives of any children you know. If you see a copy of it, see if you can talk to a sales associate about burning it. Because a heap of melted, molten plastic would be more a contribution to this world than this miserable disaster.

Pros:
- The visuals are okay.
- It's basically functional.

Cons:
- Everything else.

I highly doubt it.

I love RPG's and as big as my collection is this is the weakest title on the shelf. What is Kingdoms of Amalur? It's like EA took ideas and concepts that were popular in other games we've been playing over the past 10 years, mixed them up in a bag, and then created this game and tried to tell us it's new. This is a new game that feels very old.

 It may provide a new feeling or area of game play to those not really familiar with free roam RPG's or MMO's but if you've played those 2 genre's off the bat you'll just get flashbacks.

What Kingdoms of Amalur does well is creating a console MMO without the other players. You can feel where this game was supposed to be an MMO because it acts like one right down to the stale NPC conversations and expressions.

What makes this game not work is that the story isn't very unique and the NPC's lack of emotions don't help to sell the story to you either. It's the same Evil Lord story we've all heard about 1000times this one just cut and pasted differently. I really do play RPG's for the story but those one just didn't make me feel like I cared enough about it because it's been done to death.

On top of that Sundae is also the gameply which relies down to a ""single"" action button which makes combat very simple. Now here is the thing about Kingdoms of Amalur, they tried to tie in the idea of using different abilities like using a bow,stealth kills,spells,etc. and then tie them up into one single action button. That may be fine for 1989 but with a 6Axis in 2012 I think they could do much better. I give Two Worlds 2 the Credit for their combat system of making combat unique and mapping different skills to the controls that made you feel like you were in a battle and not just pressing an ""action"" button. What took KOA down is that I've seen their fighting concept done much better in Two Words II yet a game like that gets worse ratings. Also the Stealth sneak kill and bow attacks feel cut and pasted right out of Two Worlds 2.

So with the story and gameplay aside what is KOA really left with? Graphics?
The graphic style and atmosphere of the game I need not even speak what it reminds people of. The art style of the game isn't exactly fresh or new and neither or the dwarfs with their accents and pastel colored florescent landscapes of the game. Been there done that and everything in this game reminds me of other cities I've been to in other RPG's.

So with a borrowed art style what's left to be new?

Class build possibilities? This being a console game that hardly matters really. Usually people argue about mixing class abilities its in MMO's. It doesn't matte what class you make in an offline game because your not going to get 10-25 of your friends (if you have any) and take down a raid boss or climb arena ranks.

Maybe Unique Character Personalities?

In KOA your characters a mute blank slate. No personality and no dialog which makes the game even less interesting than it already is. Once again I use Two Worlds 2 as an example. Your character has no name but he still talks and has a personality. Although you choose the decisions your choices are what gives him personality. He's either a bad guy or a good guy but he has a conscience about his actions that he hints his thoughts on in the quest journal. Your not just a mindless ""action button"" mashing ape, your an actual character in that world that can talk to the other characters and interact with them and change their story/fate if you wish to do so. To me that is the direction Freewill/open world games like KOA should be going in.

The bottom line is that KOA is getting credit or at least hype over ideas that they either do worse than other games or borrowed from other games.

As a budget bin title this would be worth the purchase for a RPG collector.

You only get three characters and you cannot even complete ANY of the free play with these characters. All you get is story mode, three miserable adventure worlds, and only three red bricks. This games is not even really that much bigger than all the other Lego games that have come out in the past 3 years, and I have played all of the them so I know what I'm talking about. The worlds on Lego Dimensions are so small that Minas Tirith is only about fifty feet away from Hobbiton in the Lord of the Rings world! To those who are wondering if they should buy this game, I would say that you can buy three or four other really good and enjoyable LEGO games for less than the price of this partial game. Lego Batman 2 has a Gotham City free world which is much larger than any world than this game has. The Middle-Earth of Lego The Lord of the Rings is at least three times bigger than this game's version. Lego Marvel has a large free world New York and in Lego Batman 3 you can visit all of the Lantern Worlds. Furthermore, in all of these games, you can buy all of the characters, complete all of the free play, collect all of the gold bricks and red bricks, and complete the game to 100%. The best part is that you can buy all of this for less than what Lego is now charging for one INCOMPLETE game. People have said that this game is worth $100 and more , but I would say that several complete Lego games that are still perfectly fun, entertaining, and valid are worth FAR FAR more. I would spare anyone the expense of this game in favor something cheaper and just as lastingly good.

A flaw that I see in the Starter Pack is that legos come with it. The legos alone that are involved send the price out the roof. At least with other games you could choose whether or not to buy corresponding legos, and if did want to then you could pick and choose which ones to buy in relation to how much money you could afford to spend at the time. I am not against the legos that come with this game. I just don't think you should have to pay the extra expense just to receive the game. The old system of buying legos and Lego games separately is better and definitely a lot cheaper.

When someone completes this game to 100%, please comment on how much it costed to do so.

For further entertainment, check out the older LEGO games that came out on the Xbox 360 like LEGO Indiana Jones, LEGO Batman, and LEGO Star Wars the Complete Saga.

First of all, these things are incredibly uncomfortable. I don't know if razer just has a thing against people with big heads or what, but after wearing these for 30 minutes or more, it's a miracle if I don't have a headache.
Second of all, the sound is awful. I've tried a lot of cheap headphones in my life, but these might take the cake as the worst sounding. They sound worse than ear buds that you find at a dollar store.
Third of all, people were saying that my mic quality was absolutely horrendous. This frustrated me the most, due to the fact that I bought these specifically for a good mic.
Last of all, these are poorly made. They feel like cheap plastic, and after storing them on a computer desk, in the open, away from danger, they managed to break on me in a little over 3 months. The right ear didn't even work before I got rid of them via a garbage can.

Bottom line on these, is that you should not buy them. I cannot recommend a different type of headset, but I do recommend possible modding your own if you are using it for pc gaming.

1.0,False,"05 16, 2012",AFEQ9MCMMWD9E,B00178630A,Sunan Peebles,"I played D1 and D2 quite a bit. For a time, I played on Battle.net, and eventually collected some good items and had a fairly strong onlne character, but eventually I hated it (thanks to Blizzard's management and policies which did not allow you to host a non-P2P online game, and server lags from time to time). I loved playing D2 and LOD on my LAN though. No issues with hacking, because I and my group could control everything. I was foolish enough to buy and install D3 without realizing that there would be no LAN play, and no offline single player. So again, in D3 Blizzard made another major decision restricting players' freedom: internet only.

With D2, I had no problems with hacking or server lag, because I abandoned Battle.net. From my point of view, D3 is like the result of a doctor transplanting hemorrhoids to a healthy patient.

Let's review some of the arguments posted on this forum:

1) ""Things will be better after Blizzard resolves the server problems, and eventually there will be fewer users at any given time.""

For those who like online play and can accept off-and-on laggy servers or down servers at the worst possible moment, that is probably true. And Amazon ratings for D3 may go up. It is not true for me, because I have no desire to play on Battle.net. D3 will be a 1 star product from my point of view forever.

2) ""You should have known.""

That is true, but remember that many of us had been playing D2 for 12 years, and we were used to the freedom of being able to play offline. We did not imagine that Blizzard would remove that freedom in D3.

Imagine that you have been driving a certain brand of car for many years. This brand has built in ONSTAR and GPS, but up to now you could operate the car without being connected to those services. You go in and buy the latest model. The sales agent says that you have to have ONSTAR/GPS connected, but it's free. That's kind of strange, but you buy it anyway. Then you realize that you can't even drive the car without being connected. I realize that allowing a car to be returned is very different from allowing opened software to be returned, but I want Blizzard to realize that some of us will not trust them in the future. I will not ever buy from Blizzard again.

3) ""We can all blame the pirates.""

Let's see if I've got this straight. Blizzard could not control the hacking on battle.net, and so the solution is to force everyone onto battle.net, where the same hackers could attack the servers I am forced to use, and possibly attack the ports on my network that battle.net uses.

A major problem with the Steelseries Xai and Rival Vanilla is that the rubber coating/grip has a perfect day one feel which quickly starts wearing away. The feet are also not rounded from the center like you should see on a brand new Rival Vanilla(they are slightly round at the edge compared to the Rival 300's flat skate). Further, the left click feels too tight and could be enough of a problem on its own.

I also got to point out this strange bug I didn't yet solve that was referenced in another review:
""Mouse can't tell the difference between single left click and middle click. 9 out of 10 times when single left clicking chrome tabs, it thinks im hitting the middle click to close the tab. Will be getting a replacement, or refund for different.""

So, I am disappointed I didn't buy brand new and haven't seen a review touch on any of these refurbished product issues. Also, Steelseries is releasing a Rival 300S to replace the Rival 300, but I guess I still hold nostalgia for the bumpy grip on the Rival Vanilla and round-from-the-center feet.","The top shell is new, but not the grip.",1515024000,,{'Color:': ' Original Black'},

Ok let's get to it...

PROS:
- Graphics are awesome!

- I do enjoy the system of moving up in rank, earning unlocks, etc that many games like this have included. This concept really gives more to the experience and something to work towards, makes you use various weapons to upgrade them, etc.

- The maps are pretty good, but read more about maps in cons...

CONS:
- No dedicated serves. Need I say more? Well, I will anyway. This is the big news and is what really holds back the potential of this game. Is anything being done about it? Nothing that I've heard so far. The company seems to just ignore the issue.

- Steam is ""ok"" about half the time, but an absolute disaster the other half times. If it's not down completely, it can take a long time and multiple attempts to get into a game because they are trying to ""match"" you to the right game. You have no choice of map but you can choose the game type.

- Very small selection of multi-player maps which will leave you bored after a short time. They don't have any small maps (no killhouse for a fast action game) and conversely no big maps for enjoying tactical movement/sniping, that sort of game. I enjoy some of the maps, hate others, but either way would love to see more maps come out. There are so many more maps in the single player, why can't they adapt those for multiplayer use too?

- CHEATERS GALORE. Supposedly Steam, IWnet and their whole multiplayer setup was going to block people from cheating in any way. But hackers are hackers and as usual they found a way to get in.

I could go much more in depth but you've all heard it before from others. In general I do like this game, but the company is really holding it back from how much better it really could be.

Floigan Bros. was announced way back in the day - one of the original announced titles for the DC. It's been in development hell for *years*, and it suffers from a few serious gameplay issues, but more damningly, a complete lack of focus.
The game plot itself is relatively simple. You play as Hoigle Floigan, and your dopey brother Moigle tags along. Moigle is amusing in a very mentally-retarded or idiot-savant kind of way, if you find that sort of thing funny. If you don't, it's probably borderline offensive. Moigle's stupid, Hoigle's too short and weak to be useful.
Moigle needs seven parts to create his little seekrit project, and to get them, he's going to need Hoigle's help. The Brothers own a junkyard, and to screw things up even further, there's an evil guy who wants control of the junkyard, so he throws his cat henchmen down from his blimp to take over. There's no visible motivation for *why* this Baron Malodorous fellow wants the junkyard, he just does. Why are his minions cats? They just are.
""It just *is*,"" might as well be a slogan for this game. Things are arbitrary in a way that's really... bizarre. First of all, you'd think, when you're first shown the seven parts that you need (things like a chimney stack, an engine, a fan, etc.) that these are common things to find in a junkyard. So context-relevant puzzles would seem to make sense. No such luck. You find a fan by blowing up a cat, and you find the chimney stack by having a huge plant barf it up for you. Completely incoherent, illogical solutions to puzzles do not a fun game make. Why is the chimney stack there? It just *is*.
The whole game so far is like this. The design of the gameplay is simply no fun, the AI for the characters is entertaining for about five minutes, the voice samples get old quick, and the game itself, while pretty, is like talking to the Mona Lisa. It may look good, but it's not saying much.
For $5, I'd say ""pick it up."" If you're a completist, you'll have to have it. If you're curious about what they've done with it, it might be worth the [current price] to sate your curiosity. But I was *really* curious, and I feel pretty ripped off.

Unfortunately, the game focuses entirely on the eye and ear candy instead of gameplay and story.  It is, in essence, a horrible, horrible movie.
The Metal Gear franchise has never been known for believible plots, but MSG2 takes this to a whole new level.  Like always, there's a huge governmental conspiracy, this time engineered by people that supposedly died 500 years ago.  Riiiggghhht.
What's even more infuriating is the fact that MSG2 is really only a side-story.  Those of you looking forward to playing as Solid Snake again will be sorely disappointed.  Instead, his efemminate counterpart, Raiden, takes center stage.  He's the typical anime adrogenous hero, all pasty skin and long hair.  His story is not compelling in the least, and the setup to the climax is, in a word, stupid.  Anyone with half a brain will quickly see where he fits in the Metal Gear universe.
To make matters worse, all of the ""plot twists"" in the game merely serve to create un-needed confusion, and seem incredibly out of place in the middle of a conflict.  Otacon's story just reeks of a soap opera cliche.
The enemies in the game all have their own repetoire of abilities, and are all portrayed as two-dimensional, melodramatic [fools].  They look neat and flashy, but never seem dangerous.  Instead, they seem rather comical, which eradicates any sense of true drama.  I know I'm not afraid of some guy that Rollerblades while placing bombs everywhere.
The voice acting is once again horrible.  Like in the previous game, emotion is handled via melodrama.  The voices range from growly to whiney, with no middle ground.  They neither endear me to the heroes, nor do they make me fear the villains.
Finally, there is the gameplay.  The gameplay, like in the original, is great.  Unfortunately, the game hardly lets you play.  The plot moves through a series of cutscenes.  You find out where to go, go there, see a cutscene of the enemy, kill the enemy, then watch another cutscene.  Repeat until you finish the game.

Yes, the ME3 ending was awful but the rest of the series was a lot of fun and I thought there is no way the quality of the series could have fallen so far... I couldn't have been more wrong.  I truly believer my 1 star review of this game is more than justified because it is quite simply a terrible game.

First, this doesn't feel like a current gen title - in fact I found the character animations in ME 1 while lower in polygons much more believable.  Same goes for the voice acting which isn't even in the same league as the original trilogy and neither is the story.  These three things alone make one not care to see what happens next.  And yes, the character animations really are that bad.  At the same time I really don't like the gameplay mechanics at all, running, shooting, jumping just don't feel very polished and I would gladly take ME3 multiplayer over whatever they have right now which isn't fun at all.  In fact not having fun is how I feel about everything with this game.

On the system that it works on, I played through the single player and at first I was really disappointed, it got a little better in some missions but the whole campaign is disjointed and didn't flow at all. Most the time the enemies would popup and down like a duck hunt game. The final scene was good but the whole SP campaign was way too short.

Onto the multiplayer, could have been alright but most of the maps aren't that great, connectivity issues are huge and everyone I know can't get into a co-op match.

I ranked my way up and after a crash trying to quit the game I lost all my stats.

The sound is also messed up bad on Multiplayer (I have an XFI 7.1 sound card) you can't hear people around you and guns being shot 10 feet away sound like they are a mile away as do the grenades.

I have 2 9800's and the game won't run in SLI so my frame rates are 1/2 of what they should be.

Overall I wish I hadn't bought this game as it's like a beta that still needs fixing and for $50 + it shouldn't have all these problems.
I've been looking at other forums trying to fix all these issues and there are lot's of people having the same problems. My computers are way above the min spec and that isn't the reason why this game is so flaky.
They play Far Cry 2 and Left 4 Dead great as well as COD4 at max settings.

Issues aside I'd give the game a 2 out of 5 stars based on the SP campaign and the overall quality of the MP maps.

This is the worst support I have ever seen in a COD game, the game's makers won't even respond to people's questions and users are left to search for help in the user forums that are filled with people that flame you when you post a legitimate question. The sound is so bad that I just quit playing, I have a XFI 5.1 sound system and the sound is not close to working right.

And the result is game play that is so disastrous, so crippled, so dysfunctional that it is easily the worst video game launch in recent history.

So here is the deal - you can't play unless you are online. So don't even think about it while traveling, on a plane, etc. You also can't play when they are having server issues, which is basically all the time.

You also cannot save games to your computer. That's right. No local saves. So if something goes wrong with their servers (which happens, literally constantly) in the middle of playing, you lose everything. Happened to me several times. And that is assuming you can get online and play at all, which is also very hard.

Let me make this clear - if the EA servers are not working properly, YOU CANNOT PLAY THE GAME AT ALL. No single player. No nothing. It. Just. Doesn't. Work. At. All.

Oh, and here is the best part. EA has said they have a solution to the overloaded servers - they are just going to remove features from the game!

The game would've been great had the designers taken the time to fix up the unacceptable amount of bugs and glitches, and come up with a new and different style of gameplay.
What do I mean by that? Every single movement Lara makes is animated and much slower than it ought to be. A three-legged dog with one eye could swim through a pool of molasses in less time than it takes Lara to run from one side of a room to another. Not only that, but simple actions like crouching take at least 3 seconds longer than they should. And don't get me started on jumping. Jumping from ledge to ledge is about the only task the developers could come up with for you to do. Apparently, it's the camera's job to make it seem a lot harder than it is. If the camera's turned just slightly to the wrong angle, you might end up doing a side flip to your doom instead of jumping forward.
The puzzles that you come across (rarely), are usually idiotic and unrealistic. At one point in the game, you're asked to get from one side of a room to another, unfortunately the only way the door on the other end will open is if the laser security system is activated. The first thing you should notice is that these lasers are very poorly placed and any real person could easily just step over them or duck under them. Of course, being the tomb raider she is, Lara must use a series of timed run-and-jump moves to get through them, making what would be an extremely easy sequence to get through into a much harder one.
You'll learn early to save all the time. The game is extremely glitchy and freezes up in certain areas, usually when there's lots of things going on at the same time (like when three lights are turned on and there's another guy in the room). Also, since Lara dies inconsistently, you'll never know if that jump to the floor below is too far or not. I found that in certain areas, a ten foot fall to the floor can result in death, while in other places, falling forty feet will only slightly hurt your life bar.
Then there's all those nagging questions. Why is it that setting yourself on fire will slowly drain Lara's health, but stepping into a laser can kill you instantly? How come it takes seven bullets to kill a guy with no body armor? What kind of dog dies after two kicks, but remains alive after being shot several times? What's the point in the stealth mode if you almost never have to use it? In the extras section, why do the game designers claim that '""Tomb Raider"" has always set the benchmark for games'? Why does the ""Cradle Of Life"" movie trailer have such messed up audio? I could go on and on.
In conclusion, all I have to say is that ""AOD"" was not worth the wait and isn't worth your money. Save it. I hope Eidos decides to speed up the gameplay in the next ""Tomb Raider"" installment and gets some developers that aren't mental patients to work on it.

One of my biggest pet peeves is people writing video game reviews on Amazon when they haven't really played the game. Well, that's exactly what this review is going to be; and there is a very - very good reason I didn't play much of this game.

I love Sonic the Hedgehog, and if you read any of my other reviews you'll know that I also loved the Wii version of this game. The racing stages were amazing but unfortunately the Werehog wore thin too quickly and took up too much of the game. When I finally got a chance to play this for the 360 I was SO excited to see how the racing stages compared to the Wii! Would they be better? Would they be worse? The answer is...what racing stages?

In the two hours that my brother and I played this game we didn't get to one new racing stage. The only one we played was the one in the demo that we've played over and over again. Our time with Sonic Unleashed for the 360 was spent playing pointless quick time button mashing games in a plane that we didn't get to fly, and the rest was fighting a lot of bad controls, bad camera angles, bad and boring combat, awful level design and repetitive enemies in the Werehog sections.

In the Wii version the Werehog was only pointless. It could be fun at times but for the most part it was just a tacked on detour from what you really want to do in a Sonic game. It was inane, but it wasn't that much of a problem. Here, it's that much of a problem.

In the 360 version the Werehog is downright unplayable. The control is unresponsive and the hit detection is non existent half the time. You'd think that the game would compensate for such bad game play, but it actually does everything it possibly can to make things even worse for you. You get almost no save points which means if you've just spent half an hour lumbering around trying to hit things and punching nothing but air only to FINALLY - MIRACULOUSLY - get to where you are suppose to go and die, you have to re-do everything you just did OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

And that's when this game got shipped back to the rental place, but not before something unfortunate happened: I almost broke my brothers controller. True story! I've played a lot of bad games, but I've never played one so frustrating that I lost control of my self and chucked someone else's property on the floor before realizing what I was doing. But I have now; THANKS Sonic Unleashed!

A lot of people will say this review is unfair as I didn't actually play the game. Maybe the racing stages made up for the bad Werehog part of this game. I wish I knew. All I can say is: don't blame me for not knowing. If the game makers wanted me to play the racing stages, they should have let me play the racing stages. I'm not gonna spend two hours laboring through a bunch of bad clunky platforming. I'm just not.

And indeed I was having fun, with the familiar sounds of people telling me things on board, and piloting the ship in to lock phasers on a target and attack.

But that's about where the fun ends.

The way this game is built feels and looks like something ten years older than it should be, even if the graphics are somewhat top-notch and nifty for 2006.  The menu is too simple to a degree that you cannot adjust many graphics options or controls.  Even worse, you can't even SEE your controls.  And trial and error never seems to work in-game, unless you play through the DREADFUL tutorial which is overly SLOW and POINTLESS, just to teach you the most basic functions one at a time, four or five things over a ten minute period, just to learn to accelerate or decelerate without the mouse.

I got so bored with the tutorial, I gave up after exploring the first planet.  Then I skirmished.

I had absolutely no idea what was happening or why.

As the Federation, I could pick four ships maximum in my skirmish fleet, but I could only command one at a time.  No idea if I can have the other ships slaved to mine, or if they have independent AI.  I'm pretty sure they can't fight on their own, because every time I played, my other ships did absolutely nothing until I scrolled to them and manually moved them about.

I don't even know exactly what to press to attack!  I'm pretty sure it's just to left-click, but I've had so many instances where I am literally meters away from an enemy ship, smashing the left-click mouse button feverishly, and seeing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING happen, only to suddenly have my phasers open up on a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TARGET.

The mere idea of playing with Star Trek ships was a worthy idea worth making a game out of.  But they just seemingly intentionally sabotaged it with nonexistent control help and stilted, clumsy movement, completely arbitrary actions, and a limit to only four sides: Federation, Klingon, Romulan, Borg.",They don't even tell you how to pilot these ships,1257465600,2,,

The mission ""Paper Trail"" is THE most ridiculous mission ever in GTA history.  In that mission, you are supposed to take a helicopter and shoot down a target helicopter miles away with Little Jacob in the passenger seat.

I can't tell you how many times I tried doing this mission, to the point where I'm about to write an official letter to Rockstar Games.  GTA MUST have a difficulty setting adjustment!!!!  No excuses.  How can you make a game with ridiculously frustrating missions towards the end of the main storyline without any difficulty adjustment whatsoever?  This is mindless and idiotic, to say the very least.

I've had a lot of difficulty with some previous missions, and luckily, I got through those, but ""Paper Trail"" really puts the icing on the cake.  The other 40% of the game consists of side missions, which are worthless, in my opinion.  That's an even bigger waste of time!  And if you're one of those trophy-hunting nuts who needs to have every trophy in this game, then you've got no life at all.  Save your efforts on another game, not this one.

I even forgave that abomination that was on the PS2 and was a blatant copy of Baldurs Gate: Dark Alliance. But you as the consumer should know my point of view before you decide to throw 60.00 to Bethesda for something that you may or may not like.

Comparison: In comparison to Fallout 3/New Vegas, Fallout 4 tries to do too much all at once. I found myself agrivated with the game and a basic rest button was nowhere in sight. It is the kind of failure that I've seen in many of these newer games and it makes me violently ill.

Complexity: Really, what makes Fallout 4 such a garbage game is it's complexity. What made the other (successful) games good were their simplicity. They gave you enough information to understand what to do. In Fallout 4, this doesn't even seem to be the case.

Construction: So Fallout 4 lets you build and customize just about everything. It wouldn't be so bad, if it weren't so darn confusing to understand how to do somple things, like power a water purifier. On TOP of all that, you don't even get access to your direction finder, which I found to be dreadful. If they could actually simplify the building component to the game, it would be one of the most enjoyable for me.

Combat: I hate what they did to VATS. It worked much better when it froze time and let you do what you needed to do. The combat in Fallout 3/New Vegas were much better overall I think.

Perks: Perks replaced the Skills in Fallout 4 and again, don't like it very much. It's just a hazard suited for casual gamers and not really for people who were fans of games like Oblivion and Morrowind. There is just something that feels more natural about skills, then there is with perks.

Graphics: The graphics aren't really all that great in this game. It feels like they spent more time adding things that should never have existed in the first place. The graphics are just plain dull and uninteresting for what is basically a present/next generation game.

Story: You aren't looking for your dad that ran out on you and left you to deal with Vault 101. You are the mother/father of a son that was taken while you were in suspended animation. This becomes the focal point in the beginning of your journey. The problem is, it is as dull as the graphics.

It is much to my chagrin that I must say that I wish Tri-Ace would have held true to their word.  Aside from higher frame rates and sharper graphics, I&F does nothing to justify it's existence.  The story is too short with forgettable characters, and the music appears to be a lot of cut-and-paste from previous entries.  Since I'm a huge SO fan, though, I would have let this slide if the camera didn't make me sick from its unchangeable hurl-fest movements.  For starters, the camera follows your character too closely from behind.  This makes any angle correction with the right analog stick a jerky nightmare.  If that's not enough, the camera has the annoying tendency to pan up and down automatically with no user input.  Since the camera follows your character so closely, this essentially feels like the screen is shaking at times.  For reference, I'm playing on a 55-inch at 1080p, so a smaller screen may alleviate some of these issues.  The reason I'm holding at 1 star is that SE has had over a year in which they could have patched out the nauseating camera problems but have sat by idly.

When I received the item, opened the packaging, I realized that I couldn't get the case open. I attempted to apply all the force I could with my hands to get it open without outright breaking it. After contacting the seller, Videgamesdiva, I was told that this was spec stock and that I should try to open it, if it broke, I would be issued a refund.

So, I got out a metal flat head screw driver, applied a sizable amount of prying force and was able to get the case open.

The main issue is the screen protector. First off, if the screen isn't in its locked position, the case WILL NOT CLOSE without damaging your psp, so it must be locked. When it's locked, it's jammed and can't be opened without some sort of metal prying tool.

After prying it open the first time, I decided to give the case a second chance, placed my psp inside, locked the screen protector in place and closed the case. Yet again, the case was jammed shut and I was unable to open it with my bare hands. I had to use a metal flat head screw driver to get my psp out safely.

After all, Cartoon Network actually CELEBRATED their anniversaries, and even made special animated bumpers for such events. Plus, Cartoon Network's licensed video games always featured varieties of characters ranging from the older shows to Ben 10: Alien Force (See Punch Time Explosion). However, when I saw Nicktoons MLB, I figured this one would have a chance. After all, we have characters from Invader Zim and Ren and Stimpy appearing here!

But as far as the character roster goes, it isn't really all that special. We may have Ren and Stimpy characters and Zim and Gaz, but we also have FIVE Spongebob characters, FOUR Avatar characters, Danny Phantom, Dudley from Tuff Puppy, 3 Planet Sheen characters, and Fanboy and ChumChum. That's it. That's your roster (not counting the awkwardly included real-life baseball players - rendering the MLB license itself awkward). Where are the Fairly Oddparents characters? What about Rugrats? Wild Thornberrys? Arnold? CatDog? Chalk Zone? Ricko's Modern Life? Rocket Power? ANYTHING???? For a game about NickToons, there sure are a lack of them.

When it comes to the actual gameplay, there's nothing interesting. It's just baseball, but with Nickelodeon characters and baseball players. I was hoping for something to imitate Mario Super Sluggers or something, but no. The licenses are absolutely wasted as it's ordinary baseball. In fact, the game moves at a terribly slow pace. Like..seriously! The characters move so slow! And when the batter hits the ball, THE SCREEN FADES TO BLACK BEFORE SHOWING THE BALL BEING HIT INTO THE AIR! That's really flawed design. The announcer repeating full sentences/comments on the play instead of ""Strike!"" or ""Foul Ball!"" does not help, either.

Overall....You're better off with any other baseball game or Nickelodeon game. Heck....I'd say you should try and see what Cartoon Network has in store for you.

By reading through the reviews here you can tell what one of the major problems are: it takes too long and too much effort to assemble the gun, and the games that utilize it aren't worth that effort.  Once assembled, it feels rather robust, although that little nunchuck cord holder will break for sure.  Once you have the gun, forget any notion that you'll be able to effectively use any of the buttons on the remote other than B.  Then comes the play control.  Having the remote mounted on top of the light gun gives you MUCH less accuracy than you'd have if you were using just the remote by itself.  Aiming and shooting is extremly clumsy, and the sensor bar's weakness is even more evident here.

Then comes Link's Crossbow Training.  This game is a waste of time.  It's overly difficult given the clumsiness of the gun, and it seems as though it was thrown together in a single day.  It doesn't even come in a DVD case...just a cheap paper sleeve like Wii Sports.  I played the game without the gun, and actually did much better while still being pleasantly challenged.

1.0,False,"12 17, 2015",A23I7WPD6TUWVE,B00104KJ4M,David Simmons,"After having a blast with Lego Star Wars The Complete Saga, I was so excited to find this game at my local consignment shop.  I figured that with all the experience I had just built up with Star Wars, donning the Lego version of the famous hat would be also be a rollicking good time.  Nope!

At first I thought my displeasure was due to the new control options, such as switching characters regardless of distance and all the new items you can pick up and use like shovels, wrenches, weapons and puzzle pieces.  However, my frustration continued to mount.  I managed to finish all the levels for the first film, but the feeling was largely one of relief instead of triumph.  When I began playing the levels for Temple of Doom, I got so irritated with the punitive, non-intuitive game play that I decided to go back and Free Play in the Raiders levels.

That didn't work for several reasons,which I've listed below:

- Overall, the level design is surprisingly small and uninspired after the often epic scope of Star Wars.  There is rarely a feeling of majesty or amazement, many of the levels feel cramped and somehow unfinished.  In many of the Star Wars levels I found myself just stopping and just admiring what I was looking at.  That didn't happen once in any of the Indy levels, which is unforgivable given how many amazing widescreen vistas there are across the trilogy.

- The rate of accidental death is WAY to high.  I guess the programmers thought that players should really feel like Indy in this game, so they take advantage of every opportunity to abuse the player.  With only a whip to start, you get shot and killed a LOT.  Even leaping directly into the fray every time will not save you from bullets.  Picking up a pistol instead of a shovel or a torch in the heat of battle is a losing gamble, and you die some more.  Why can't you whip the weapons out of enemies hands?!

- It's WAY to easy to kill yourself without meaning to.  One of the key moves of the Indy character in the game is to punch things apart to get studs.  However, each time you punch, Indy takes a step.  Well, if you're standing near a cliff, you can punch your way right into the abyss.  No player would do this intentionally, and neither would the character, so the fact that this is possible is to me symptomatic of lazy and/or cruel programming.

- The level design is uninspired.  The Map Room scene in Raiders is one of my favorites, yet it's only a cut scene.  Why not make this part of a level where Indy has to decode which hole in which to put the Staff of Ra before heading off to the Well of Souls?  I enjoyed all the activities in the submarine hangar near the end, but they could have added a whole sequence of Indy navigating the rocky canyons of the island in order to catch up with Belloq and the Ark.  Another potential level portion relegated to a cut scene.

- The opening level of Temple of Doom has horribly non-intuitive puzzle moments, one in involving a giant gong.  What is so surprising is that the game provides hints of what to do earlier, but nothing for this particular one.  After looking it up, I realized that I would have had to watch the movie immediately prior to playing this level to figure out the next move.

I cannot recommend this game.  It feels like SO half-hearted.  None of the inspiration clearly present in the Star Wars Complete Saga is present here.

I was expecting at least a little bit more of a traditional RPG with more realistic game play. TWEWY was far from what I expected. From the first time I booted it up, I thought ""oh no.. this looks cheesy - I'm going to hate this game"", but I gave it a chance anyway. After way too much ridiculous dialogue involving two characters that you can't help but hate, the game finally begins (sort of..). I finally got into the combat part of the game, which I absolutely hate. It feels like a mix of Dance Dance Revolution and Final Fantasy 2. You are expected to control two characters at once: one at the top of your screen, and the other at the bottom. On the bottom you run around in an extremely limited space using different attacks while trying to avoid the enemy. While doing this, you are expected to follow a pattern of buttons to push to control the character on the top screen, which I have found impossible, as I am not a chamelean and my eyes do not look in different directions at once. If you ignore the bottom screen for more than a second, you get bombarded by enemies. After trying to figure it out, I found it too difficult to resist the urge to destroy my DS by slamming it against the coffee table, so I just left the top screen on autoplay (which apparently the autoplay does a terrible job and makes it impossible to achieve higher than a C on any battle, which hinders game play.)

  So now I officially hate: the gameplay, the characters, and the combat. I decide ""Hell, 98% of people on Amazon loved the game, so lets keep going and try and see what they see."" I played a few more hours, gathered a few more ""pins"", and all I discovered is that 98% of people on Amazon are morons. I must say though, I hate the characters a little bit less. But I definitely hate the game much more. Boss battles have become extremely difficult because I have no choice but let the computer control my 2nd character - but wait! I have the ability to switch the game to ""easy"". I read reviewers say they like this aspect, but to me it's a cop out. Square Enix failed to make a consistent game and decided it would be easier to have us switch difficulties throughout the game than to fix it. In this reviewers opinion, Square Enix failed to make a tolerable game. I am surprised to see that anyone enjoyed it, and baffled as to how so many people loved it.

(then why is it required to have internet connection to play single player?  Read on:)

Day 1 RELEASE: (from the perspective of an 8 month pregnant lady on BED REST with plenty of time!)

Diablo 3, like it's predecessors, is a SINGLE PLAYER game with a small online player option. In previous Diablo games, you could play single player without an internet connection (which I would do a lot when my internet wasn't available) but apparently in a last minute decision, Blizzard decided Diablo 3 REQUIRES internet connection to play....P E R I O D!  My husband spent $60 per game for us to play this, and we can't even log into the game because their ""Battle Net"" servers have an unresolved issue.  WHAT!?  I don't want to play with anyone else!  I JUST WANT TO PLAY....by myself!  I think it is a boggle to the mind why Blizzard would demand us to go through a high traffic severely LAGGY server just to play a single player game.  Hello?!  What are they thinking?  If I wanted to lag to heck and back I would go play a REAL mmorpg.  What is up with these massive companies forcing us to use their servers (umm Skyrimm and Steam anyone??)  I am so disappointed because we have waited so long for this 3rd installment of a great franchise only to be told we must have an internet connection to play at all!  Believe me when I say that the single player mode is laggy as all get out.  I have talked to some people that can't even play the game.  They start to fight a monster only to die and not even know why.....the lag is that bad!
If you have not purchased this game, I would suggest holding off for now.  $60 for an unplayable game is a pure RIP OFF.  Wait until people are getting tired of it and maybe the online traffic will die down and in turn....the lag as well!  Wait until the price goes down to $25 (or less hopefully).  Pray to GOD they decide to allow us to play OFFLINE on single player mode.  Today is a sad day for the gaming world.  :(  I never thought I would end up rating this game a one star.....Sad but true.

UPDATE: Day 2. (almost 24 hours later) STILL not able to log into ""Battle NET Servers""  Reason given: There is an unknown issue that is not allowing the game to be properly authenticated, or I receive a ""server busy"" error.

It has been stated by a fellow player that the single player game (mind you it is different per person) was beaten in 12 1/2 HOURS!!! Even more shocking, this man was lucky enough to log in that long!

2 weeks after release UPDATE:

Ok I am really gonna RANT now!  I have been able to get online and play.  The game is decently fun, I'll at least give Blizzard that, but last night they patched the game.  I logged back in only to find my level 18 monk totally naked, no money, no stash box items and 3 people on ""recently played with"" list that I have never seen.  First of all I have not played with another person.  I have not added a friend in the game.  I am 8 months pregnant and I don't have time or patience to play with anyone else right now.  Upon further digging in the forums I found many other people screaming that the same thing had happened to them.  I sent an in-game report to Diablo 3 for in game help.  No reply as of 20 hours now.  I tried to call their 1 (800) number.....umm the hold time is a minimum of 2 hours!!!!!!!!!  I don't have TIME nor should I have to give that kind of time for help.  This is a GAME STOPPING ISSUE!  I cannot play the game because I have no armor or money to buy more armor.  I also read on the forums that no one has gotten help from Blizzard concerning this game stopping issue.  They are claiming we played with someone and gave them our password and they in turn....""Hacked"" our game.  Umm WHAT?  You are telling me that hundreds of people are paying $60.00 for our game....then randomly giving out our passwords to strangers that just so happen to be evil enough to take all we have?  Yeah Blizzard....it's OUR fault.  I'm just sayin if we would have been able to play the game without logging into battle net I wouldn't have been so called ""hacked"" as they say.  I don't believe I was hacked, I think it's a cop out on their part to throw the problem on the customer.  They have a game issue.  The game is LOSING our gear and items so we must have been UNSAFE, therefore it's our fault!

I'll give it that.  But outside of that, it is terrible.  All of the levels are linear.  No options, no secrets, no anything... just run through and press attack a bunch.  No mini-games, no eggs, no gems to collect, no fun.  Noticed something odd, it's like they tried to make it like God of War.  Power ups in the same way, melee based (Spyro's tail swipe looks oddly like flailing your daggers in GOW), even a weird level at the end that requires lots of jumping.  The worst part of it is, there are only like 5 enemies in the whole game.  You fight monkeys.  Then monkeys.  Then monkeys.  All are the same... some are made bigger and in each level they have on a new jacket or gear or something.  They keep attacking and attacking and attacking... nothing exciting, they just keep attacking.  My wife and I said we wouldn't go on with our day until we finished this stupid game.

Anyways, heres the problems.
-Cannot change the class of character, any weapon you find that aren't dual sabers cannot be equipped ever.
-The dungeons are repetitive. They use the same terrains and pots and dead bodies and stuff.
-Trading system boring, its basically the only interaction you need.
-People say the same thing constantly.
-In total, this game has 64 characters i believe. All together, civilians and players. I got the ryu book and it told me. I honestly don't know how boring it can get then 64 characters.(like 12 of them being playable)
-Boring plot, your friend goes in a coma, some chick is running around, and the game doesn't have any plot.
-In order to mooch as much money as possible from the game, Bandai decided to release FOUR, F-O-U-R Games. For FIFTY dollars each. Meaning this series requires 200 bucks to be completed. Considered the first one took me 15 hours basically, Bandai could of easily fit in more, instead they want more and more money. Basically this means the game isn't even a full game.

The front channel on the headphone amp kept making strange noises then blew out and would no longer make any sound out of the right can. Turtle Beach has no telephone support line. Only email. Got jerked around by tech support to determine that the set was indeed bad then got transferred to their RMA department to get an RMA number. All via email. Took Days. Total unnecessary time consuming hassle. THEN I had to ship them back at my expense to get them repaired. And I had to hand write a note and place it inside the box with the RMA number written all over it. Unorganized company. Simply rediculous.

But wait, it gets better.

After they received the headphones, I didn't hear from them for weeks. Then in ""MAY"" I shot them an email asking what the status was. They shipped it same day. Coincidence? Maybe. But when I received the headphones and plugged them back in, I had the exact same problem as the last. So really, did they even fix it? Or just pretend to fix it and send the exact same broken pair back to me? Either way, I'm not happy and I wish I could just return these damn things to Amazon because they're a total waste of money. I will never purchase Turtle Beach products ever again in my lifetime and may I suggest you all do the same.

Update: 6-10-2011
Tried to contact Turtle Beach to get another RMA number and to ask them to pay for shipping to return the headphones for a 2nd repair. No response. Ended up emailing every Turtle Beach email address I could find on the web and finally their RMA team sends me another RMA number insisting I pay to send them back again. I responded and pleaded my case about them sending me a broken set on the last RMA. They actually agreed and provided a pre-paid Fed-ex ground label! I was totally shocked to say the least. I was going to throw them away if I had to pay to ship them back again.

A month went by and still no repaired headphones in the mail. I sent them another email with the RMA clearly listed in it and they asked that I provide the tracking number for the pre-paid label they provided me in the first place. The tracking information clearly showed that they received and signed for the package. I shot this information to them in an email then, no response. Few days go by. I send them another email. No response. These guys are the WORST I've ever had to deal with. And that's no exaggeration. To be continued...

Update: 6-27-2011
OK so I still haven't been able to use my headset since I originally sent it our for repair back on April 10th. It is now the 27th of June. I have sent the headphones back for repair twice and both times was sent back a broken unit. Same issue. In-line headphone amplifier. I have once again sent them an email stating that they sent me another broken set. It's been two days since I sent them that email and still no response. But I'm used to this already. They won't respond unless I email everyone in the company. Aside from the amplifier issue, this last headphone pair they sent me is all scratched up and has a slight tear in the leather around the cups. Nothing anywhere near the mint condition of tthe original I sent them. Turtle Beach is the worst company on the planet and anyone who orders their products is in for a real treat if they have any issues. I hope they go completely broke and fold. I'm ready to contact the BBB and file a formal complaint against them but I truly wonder if it will do any good. I'm thinking I'm going to just cut my losses at this time and get the Logitech G930.

Instead of fostering good will with their customers, they are forcing a ""first sale"" by creating an environment of FUD where a person buying a game off of eBay or Amazon Marketplace is worried about the install count remaining on a game. What nonsense.

Can you imagine buying a copy of this game from Amazon Marketplace and find out that there are no install counts left (remember: artificial limitation)?

The buyer gets a defunct copy of the game and has to fight with Ubisoft for another install count. It's not their fault, but they have to deal with it.

At the same time I was looking forward to this game, I knew that CD Projekt had been taking customer suggestions/complaints to heart and were working on a massive reworking of the dialog for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Witcher/dp/B000R2XJJK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Witcher</a>.

This free patch was released in September of 2008 along with digital copies of the map, soundtrack, making of videos, game manual and game hints/tricks book. That shows me that they truly understand what fostering good will is all about.

I could have easily gone and purchased a used copy, but I instead decided to pre-order a retail copy of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Witcher-Enhanced-Edition/dp/B001AH8YSW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Witcher Enhanced Edition</a>&nbsp;(no activation!) to show my appreciation for all of their hard work.

If you buy this game from Ubisoft, you are telling them that it is ""ok"" to limit resale. You are then setting a precedent for other publishers to do the same.

Does anyone remember&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bioshock/dp/B000MK694E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bioshock</a>? That game certainly is well known for multiple things, one is it's the first game that truly brought the activation requirement to the fore front. Since it went on to do great in sales and customers didn't really rally against it, the precedent has been set.

It's ""ok"" the customers said, ""we'll deal with it. We just want the game"".

Well guess what, the publishers heard you loud and clear and are happy to deliver the activation process as part of your gaming experience.

""So what!?"", you may say, ""I'll just buy the console version"" or ""Just buy a copy and then shelve it right before I grab an unlocked copy"".

You go ahead and do that, hand over your money to a company that is determined to strip resale rights away from their customers. The next thing you know you'll find that this practice migrates to consoles.

After all, there isn't much left that makes a console stand apart from a PC in terms of tech. Sure, a PC ""can"" use better hardware, but for a vast number of customers a current generation console is ""good enough"" for their graphical needs.

In summary, I'm rating this product as a dud:

Needless to say I sent it back the same day.  And to think that I was considering buying it at one time!  Ech!

Okay, let's crack my knuckles and prepare to rant!  (Ha ha)

The biggest problem is how often you'll die in this game, over and over and over and over and over and over and over and... yeah, I think you get it.  As you're being chased by cops (who for some reason seem to commit the city's entire police force just to stop you), you need to be on the lookout for your escape route, that next jump, that next ladder, that next alley which will take you to the next checkpoint and one step closer to the level's goal.  The problem is that these key passages are devilishly well hidden, so it's all too easy to pass them right by and run face-first into a dead end.  So by the time you realize you overshot your escape route and turn back, you're cut off by the fuzz.  Oh, and did I mention the cops shoot?  Yes, they open fire on an unarmed, non-violent suspect.  And you drop dead after just a handful of hits.  Stopping to survey your surroundings isn't an option either, because the fast-moving cops are right on your arse; you need to be constantly moving if you don't want precious Faith painted red with her own blood.  Trying to fight the cops isn't the answer either since Faith is a lithe, agile athlete built for speed rather than combat; trying to engage a cop with her fists is suicidal, and will again get her painted red with her own blood.

So it's a cheap trial-and-error system that's in place: you'll get painted red repeatedly, replaying the same segments over and over again, trying to find the obscure key passage.  The hints that Merc, your boss, feeds you over your radio is completely useless, since he says redundant crap like ""Cops are coming!  Get out of that building now!"" or ""Get off that roof, Faith!  I don't care how; just do it!""  No, really?  Cops are coming?  Wow, Merc, you figure that out all by yourself?  Speaking of hints, holding down the hint button does nothing except to confuse you further because half the time it points in a completely random direction, nowhere near where you're actually supposed to go.

Wait... I'm not done!

The control scheme also suffers from bad design.  The ""Up Action"" function (which is the game's fancy-pants way of saying ""jump button"") is central to gameplay and the most frequently used function.  This function is mapped to the left bumper, one of the less reliable buttons on the 360 controller.  Your only alternative is the RIGHT bumper, the OTHER unreliable button.  Genius!

I give the developer, Dice, kudos for trying something new.  I really wanted to like this game because it was so different and new: the free-running premise, the MTV-style cartoon cutscenes, and the visual style of the city you inhabit are all fresh.  The city, in particular, is rendered in blinding, stark whites and grays which look artificial and sanitized.  This color palette does a good job of reinforcing the game's storyline wherein an all-powerful totalitarian government has established what seems like a utopia at first glance, but at the cost of all freedoms.  The concepts that Dice tried to implement are a breath of fresh air in the video game industry, but it's truly a shame the game's mechanics and design choices leave me frustrated and scratching my head.

Yes, you're going to think that I got 200 hours of enjoyment out of it, but no I didn't.  I kept reading that if I get to X section or X level or X difficulty or X gear that the game comes alive.  700 days played in World of Warcraft.  Thousands of hours played in D2.  Having played many Blizzard games I kept giving this trash the benefit of the doubt but finally realized it was nothing but Blizzard fan boys talking and quit.

I believed in Blizzard Entertainment.  I really, really did.  From the start the game is doomed as the story has more holes than a block of Swiss cheese.  Then you're expected to play the game in a group where one guy always clicks skip story.  Playing solo is futile as your gear drops will be for another class, thus you need different classes in your group to share the loot.  Sounds pretty stupid right?  It is trust me.  What if the other guy in the group doesn't want to share?  You get nothing.  Fun huh?  So at this point you're stuck buying gear off the auction house for either millions of gold or real money.  This game is all about the fun of looking on the auction house for gear to beat a level.  Pure fail Blizzard!  Pure fail!

Then there are issues with the game's difficulty as it makes you play the game out on beyond easy mode where I lost 3 friends to boredom.  They refused to finish the first difficulty as they literally danced in the fire, intentionally got hit, and never died.  They said the game was crap and quit.  The game doesn't get decent until the 3rd time you've played it through.  So you have to play the exact same game 3 times before you get a challenge unless you fall asleep at the keyboard from boredom and die.  If you get to a section you can't get past just buy some gear off the auction house and more than likely you're back to god mode again.

Last point I want to touch on is that the game's end game is nonexistent.  As in it's hard not because it's fun, but because it cheeses you into death.  I play a Demon Hunter and most everything can one shot you unless you invested hundreds of million in gold into your gear.  Then you can last for 3 hits!  So assume you're not the type of person to spend real money on the auction house.  So you're going to get a ton of one hit deaths when you try to kill elite mobs.  You might die 9 times to a mob if you're not spending real money on gear.  Repair bill will be close to 50,000 gold.  The mob will drop about 3,000 gold in items and money.  So then you get in a group and pray that the mob decides to chase another person.  But there are tons more of them so you still die over and over.  Sounds like fun huh?  Who thought mechanics that can one shot kill you were fun?

I also want to mention that the game lags like no other.  Take the one shot mechanics from the aforementioned paragraph and sprinkle in some huge lag spikes and you can watch your characters die over and over to invisible mobs, invisible attacks, melee mobs hitting you clean across your screen, etc.  And there is a Hardcore mode where if you die you lose your character and all of it's gear.  That makes the game even more fun with lag!

Game is terrible.  Leave it in the store.  Do not buy.  It is not fun in the slightest when you get to Inferno.  The story is terrible.  The gear drops don't exist for you.  The auction house is the best place to level up.  And the real money auction house has the best gear.

First, this PS2 game takes the world of Yu-Gi-Oh! and transplants it into the middle ages, with the War of the Roses. The houses of Lancaster and York are vying for the throne of England, and only cards can settle it.
OK, I don't mind that. I love English history, and I also enjoy card games. So into the tutorial we head. While they go over every step in the game, it's one gigantically long rush of about 1/2 hour or more. And instead of letting you practice the commands and repeat them, it's a slideshow-like sequence where you just keep hitting X ... X ... X. You really need a walkthrough to print out to have it all available and ignore their slideshow.
Finally you get to the game. You choose a default deck and take it into ""battle"" as you try to move across England. Problem 1 - there's no practice! You go from that slideshow right into a nasty battle that many find difficult to win. You are often dealt awful cards that even skilled players find it hard to win with. It's hard to learn the game when your monsters are stomped easily left and right.
At least you might have pretty things to look at and listen to while you die, right? Wrong! The graphics for the cards are awful. You can barely tell what element something is or anything else. Even the important numbers are hard to decipher. And for sound, you get the same droning loop of synth music again and again.
Cardplay is new and unusual, with monsters moving across the board and facing each other on different terrain types. It's sort of interesting but can be extremely frustrating, especially for new players. You do get a semi-cool 3d ""quick battle"" when the cards meet, but even that is on a boring background and lasts maybe 5 seconds.
Perhaps worth it for the incredibly-dedicated Yu-Gi-Oh! fan, but the rest of us should demand something better next time. This game is an embarassment given the quality of PS2 games coming out today.",Amazingly bad considering the potential,1048291200,12,,

Background: Huge fan of 999 and Virtues Last Reward.  VLR in my opinion remains the best game on the 3DS.  I was ecstatic when Zero Time Dilemma was announced (especially since it was rumored it never would be).  I ordered the limited edition watch version day 1 (and I rarely pre-order games).

Let's talk about positives first.
- Soundtrack: Remains top notch.  It isn't as good as VLRs (and many tracks are remixes from VLRs) but it's still good.  Great sense of mystery and music to pump you up.
- The overlay and user interface is nice.  Can write notes and easily recall them.

Neutrals:
- Puzzles: The puzzles have always been an important factor in these games.  These puzzles were a little bit more difficult but I really found some just boring and not interesting.  I don't think they were BAD they just aren't really good.

Negatives: Oh man
- The way they present the story: They dropped the bomb so hard.  This fragment system is the most idiotic thing I have ever seen. Whomever decided to present it in this way should honestly retire from the gaming industry.  It is possible to get stuck in the game in which you have to re-watch certain events and choose actions in an order to progress.  You will get stuck multiple times.  Because the game is presented in these fragments you will never have a clear idea about what has or has not happened.  Things are all jumbled up and it didn't really allow me to develop any connection with the characters.
- Characters: They built up Akane, Junpei, Phi in the past games and I expected so much.  Nothing.  Stupidity.  They made them idiots (how could they) and introduced boring characters with silly backgrounds.
- Story.  That ending..wow.  Horrible.  I don't mind them leaving it on a cliff hangar but this was just silly.  VLRs left us on an insane cliffhanger that I was so pumped for.  How could they ruin this series so bad.  I honestly had to force myself through this game.

One hit is all it takes, it doesn't matter if you have full health, health packs, full ammo, super guns etc....one grab and your toast.  Your character (who can be lit on fire, survive explosions, fall from heights if you can without grabbing a ledge mid flight and be shot insane amounts of times with buckshot before dying) just lies there like a 10 year old girl and gets owned by the special infected.....it's pathetic and makes the game needlessly frustrating.  Your whole group could be knocked down, not dead just knocked down and if you get grabbed by any special infected the games over....that is amazingly stupid.  Why the hell can't your character fight back against these lame enemies?.  The temp. invincibility the zombies have is kind of lame, it's a glitch maybe but you shoot the bastards and they keep hitting you like your bullet magically passed threw them.  The tank teleports threw walls, not busts threw them just teleports as if one shotting you to death isn't enough.  Computer controlled Smokers tounges can defy logic by going around corners in perpendicular shapes or threw pinholes, doors, and walls.  Hunters can miss you with a pounce or pounce backwards in different directions and you still teleport under them and get owned.  Skill is not required or achieveable in this game, they will get you every single time.  When you get once shot you die due to the moronic AI players that stand there and watch you get lamed, it's maddening. The bots are cleptomanical retards that bust through windows, teleport through doors or walls, and teleport past you to steal every first aid pack and pills in the level.  They also walk in front of your crosshair most anytime you shoot, they open any door you close and end up just being total useless idiots.  I usually just gun them down and take their health packs when I need one, or they steal them using means beyond physics.  The harder the difficulty the more useless they are.  This game also has hovering molotov cocktails. If a horde is running at you and you throw one into it, the molotov will hover for a few seconds before exploding, ensuring any special infected are safly away from it and that your surrounded by ""zombies"" taking damaged before the fire kills anything.  I put zombies in quotes because these zombies don't eat people they simply pummel you to death with punches and kicks.  Left 4 Dead also has bloodthursty fire, yes anytime you blow up a gas can or throw a molotov the fire chases you, even sometimes when it's invisible it still damages you, maybe it's infected too?  The DLC was a total joke and made Valve look tired and lazy.  Survival mode sucks, you get a tiny blocked off part of a level already in the game, a crappy tiny lighthouse level all of which have an instant finale with endless ownage with baddies raining from the sky until you die.  Millions of Zombies, multiple hunters, multiple smokers, multiple tanks raining down on you until your dead.....wow so much fun to die in 1-3 mins in a tiny locked area when every special infected can one shot you.  The PC version actually has new campagins made by fans since Valve is too lazy to make them.  L4D II still has no dlc with valve again saying on the games release that they would support the games with dlc. L4D ii was a major step down from l4d which is flawed and glitched beyond logic itself.  If you want a real zombie game Killing Floor is the way to go its eons better and tripwire fully supports their games with new dlc regularly unlike valve which give you one extra short map and that's it.  Also no monster or zombie can rape you simply by touching you in KF when you have full health you can go down fighting. In l4d you sit there crying for useless clepto AI players to save you while they watching you die while gorging on health packs and pills.  This is a pathetic, retardedly glitched, broken, frustrating piece of garbage....trust be get Killing Floor.  L4D 2 builds on the same problems but just adds more special infected that only need to touch you once coupled with endless larger hordes....it's virtually unplayable.  L4D 2 is simply a 60 dollar update that should have been part of L4D 1 but valve say fit to abandon L4D after 1 half assed tiny DLC patch.","Love zombie movies, games, but this sucks.",1232582400,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

1) scroll wheel - i totally love it. nice and smooth.
2) good looking, too bad it's NOT USABLE!

CONS:
1) Software is crazy laggy, won't change sensitivity after their tool is installed. After computer restarts sensitivity drops back to maximum. Very very stupid not finished software, not ready for the market at all. What a big shame.
In fact was working better without their software. Software itself is so ugly, looks like it's from 90s.
2) right button annoyingly squeaks - what a surprise at this price point.
3) Mouse drops connection every once in a while
4) battery dies like crazy, dies overnight on IDLE if you don't put it to charge - crazy isn't it? And they used NiMH battery btw. Why?
5) Overall ergonomic design is a total fail, feels really bad in a palm, and way too flat for human hand. height adjustment has no practical point, another bell for kids. Changes almost nothing.
6) Side buttons - designed by octopus and FOR OCTOPUS. if you find these buttons actually usable and comfortable, my congratulations - you are an Octopus! :) Not very funny though to see it on $136 mouse in a fancy cube box.

Bottom line - it's a toy for kids with many visuals that are there for no practical reason. There is not much brain behind this mouse design.

1.0,False,"12 31, 2010",A1J2JAPZ4DOGZA,B002BSA1C6,Ernest P. Bigglebottem,"I was a huge fan of GT4.  I loved the menu layout, the varied race types, and the vehicle customization.  That, sadly, was five years ago.  In the interim, I got distracted by a number of other racing games, notably the Forza series.  I came back to this expecting it to be a leap forward commensurate with the long development cycle.

Sadly, I was mistaken.  One of the great things about the Forza series are that you can start with one car and run it to death until you've accumulated a lot of money.  A couple of careful purchases would allow you to do the first 20% or so of the game with just a couple of cars.  The reward ones you got were useful in the early stages.  None of this applies to GT5.  You are gifted cars at seemingly random intervals, and none of them really do you any good.  The first series of races in the game require totally different, specific cars, and the game provides you with little help in selecting which car to buy.  For a game that prides itself on having 1000 cars (which it doesn't, but we'll get to that), you are unable to sort them in any meaningful way.  For example, there's a series of races for rear-wheel drive cars.  I'd love to whip open the dealership tab and filter out all but the relevant cars...but this feature is missing.  The cars are expensive compared to what you earn for completing races.  If I won cars that I could use in subsequent races, this might not be a problem.  If I was able to compete in races multiple times to earn the financial reward and build up a bank account big enough to buy and upgrade the necessary cars, this might not be a problem.  Both are impossible.

The amount of customization is almost nil.  You can't even change the color of your vehicle without using a ""paint chip"" which you only receive when you buy a car.  And you only get one paint chip.  Since I can't select colors from a color wheel, I'd at least like to use a chip more than once, which for some reason is impossible.  All vehicle upgrades are the same and cost the same, which is absurd.  There's no ability to swap powertrains out on cars, which boggles my mind.  Forza's been doing this for 2 generations now!  GT5 has rally racing, but the only upgrade you can put on cars for off-road driving is a set of tires.  I'm smart enough to know generally which vehicles would be suited to rallying, which is fortunate because GT5 gives you zero guidance on any of this.

If this had come out a year after GT4, people would have been complaining about how it's a step back.  I can't imagine what went through the minds of the developers when they were putting this together.  I never have access to all 1000 cars at once, I can't do arcade races with 80% of the vehicles in the game, and the best addition (the kart racing) is relegated to specific tracks and one kart.  In thinking about the time I've spent with this game, one thing is abundantly obvious: the developers cared more about the cars themselves than constructing an actual racing game.  The photo mode works wonderfully, but I don't want to spend all of my time taking pictures of cars, and I think that Polyphony would disagree with me here.

Does it work?  Yes, it does.  Does it run well?  Sort of - the handling is surprisingly clunky, which I guess is supposed to make it feel like a ""sim"", but the top-tier supercars felt like slightly faster bricks.  The menu systems are frustrating to navigate and GT5 almost demands a level of knowledge about specific cars that many non-car-geeks will not possess.","Ultimately little more than a very, very pretty PS2 game",1293753600,12,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The entire game consists of you (and your friends) running around slightly different dungeons collecting coins and food and killing off some badly rendered enemies.

I played up to Tier 9 (10 total tiers). I spent a lot of time on this game before I gave up. Here is my final review of the game:

No matter what you like about this game they will change it in the next patch. Particular vehicles, classes, maps, whatever.

Don't even think about building up your arty. They nerf it over and over and over. If you were unfortunate enough to have rolled arty a few years ago then you pretty much lost all that progress as they took every single ounce of fun out of arty. What they do is change the game mechanics to your shot has a lesser chance of hitting, then they slow your reload and increase the time it takes to aim. You can literally do your homework while waiting for arty to reload.

Getting a good tank is a matter of luck. You might spend months playing a particular research line (as it takes that long) only to find out that there is a TERRIBLE tank in that line. One that will take months upon months of playing a tank you hate. You have three choices at this point 1) play another tank then pay (a lot: $20+) to convert your experience, 2) play through it. 3) Start another line from scratch. World of Tanks knows you'll eventually just get frustrated and pay your way through. WoT also uses patches to change the stats on vehicles. You might find a tank you really like but they change it so you will want to play something else. They absolutely do this on purpose. Why? To keep you moving up lines and buying gold to skip almost unplayable tanks.

The game is built to encourage people to buy gold. The model works for sure. But, if you aren't one of those people thats going to put money into every single round then don't expect to do very well. If you don't have a premium tank you don't make as much silver (money), don't get as good of match making (who you fight against) and your crew increases in experience slower. Pretty much, you can grind for months and get now where.

Micro-transactions are a huge part of this game. Don't expect to enjoy this game if you aren't will to pay and pay often. It isn't cheap. I have probably spent over $150 on this game so far. Now that I'm not spending more money on it the enjoyment level went WAY down.

Edit: for those of you who think you'll get to T10 then just play that, you're wrong. Those tanks lose money on average, so you're forced to play lower tiers (which only make a small amount of money), buy and exchange gold, or buy a premium tank.",No matter what you like about this game they will change it in the ...,1440028800,,,

Now, on to the review. I'm always loved Maxis games, and own all of the sim city games, going back to the original for Nintendo. I also own the Sims, the Sims II, and enjoyed them quite a bit. So I was really looking forward to this game, and have tracked its progress for nearly two years.
I was excited about the concept, and watching as my genetic children grew to take over the universe...

Sadly, most of what was most exciting about that original concept has been stripped from the game. Now, as other have mentioned, adding more legs doesn't increase speed more than a better +5 foot. Many of the genetic options are self-excluding, because why would you pick an inferior body part even if it looked cool, knowing it would make your creatures ultimately inferior?

The game play is tiresome and monotonous. I got bored at the begining, and then the space stage is nearly unplayable. It is so boring, I find myself wishing it were more like Stelcon3D, a game that is almost 20 years old!

After nearly two weeks of trying to really, really like FFXIV I can say with out a doubt that this game is absolute rubbish and a complete waste of money. I bought the collector's edition and other than the joy I had of seeing the huge box arrive, FFXIV has been nothing but one disappointment after another. The CE itself is cheap paperboard, the included bound book a few paged of colored pics with the rest wasted and repeated watermarked pages. The only thing ""special: about is was the FFXIV version of the security token as even the DVD case box art is lame cgi.

As for the game itself it is one hassle after another... Make SE account if you don't have one. Add FFXIV to SE account. Add token. Add third party payment account. Verify third party payment account. Find out third party payment option is one of the worst in the business and get endless calls from my credit card company stating as much. Enter bonus codes again and again until server accepts them. Install... Patch... Try to play...

Windowed mode requires window frame... Yuck!!! Exit... Change settings... Fullscreen!!! Alt+Tab... CRASH!!! SE still knows how to make computer users hate life. (back to windowed mode it is)

It looks pretty standing still, until you move. Even with a 3.8Ghz 6-Core and SLI'd GTX 470s I only get 20-30fps in the main areas (damned windowed mode). It runs like a bad console port and the shadows, even when set on high) make all the characters look like crap. Outland areas cap at 60, so I guess it has that going for it. Quests and combat aren't that horrible but get stale/repetitive rather quickly.

Of course SE didn't forget to take everything that should have been a no-brainer cut and past from XI and leave it out of XIV.

No Ctrl+""key"" menu short cuts
No seek party flag
No Auction House (seriously!?!?)
No way to sort inventory
No map markers
No party/npc targeting through F1~8 keys
No way to quickly do anything!!!

Unresponsive GUI (requires ACK from server)
Mobs that pop after they agro if you use Herme's boots

This game could have been so much fun - it has amazing graphics and sense of motion, but it is absolutely ruined by some of the most frustrating gameplay I have ever experienced.

Anyone who is interested in this game for the story I suggest you merely watch the videos on youtube, or whatever.  There will be a LOT less frustration with the final boss fights.

The fight is hard to explain unless you have played the game.  It simply is an impossible fight.  If I wanted 'impossible' fights, then that is what I would have selected as a difficulty level.  A 'developer' force the issue arbitrarily makes customers less likely to buy their games in the future.  And leave negative feedback/reviews.  Along with a complete absence of fixing the game with patches.

That is in addition to the game breaking quest bugs.  The bugs are that some of the quests for the main story fail to cease after you repeat them.  That is, they reset themselves from the beginning as if you did nothing.

For instance, in the first town you get too, you help a stubborn sheriff with various tasks to help the town.  Once you finish, however, the sheriff wants you to do it again.  Except the world fails to let you as you already collected the quest items.

I am by far a typical person to complain about anything.  I was perfectly willing to overlook even the quest bugs, though they do detract from the game.  However, the difficulty of the final fight in the world heart with the game set on its minimal setting is just too much... I'll just watch the final sequence on youtube for closure instead of wasting time with a masochistic developer.

I could tell with certain elements of the story and of course Morrigan's voice over, that the developers like Dragon Age and Mass Effect a lot.  That is great because I do too, it is a terrible shame that they should really stick with playing games instead of making them.",Play Dragon Age or Mass Effect Instead,1406246400,3,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'},
1.0,False,"06 13, 2013",A2JRMCHFSW3SPG,B0053BCML6,BIG BUNGO&#039;S TINY REVIEWS !,"I bought this game expecting an exciting GTA-like open world game where I'm free to do what I want, but unfortunately the only combat to be found in this game is chopping down trees. I'm serious! There's only one weapon - the axe. And you can't even kill anybody! If you go up to them and try to hit them, it'll just start a conversation with them.

You live in a neighborhood full of animals such as dogs, cats, etc, and they all live in their own house. You would expect there to be an option to rob them, or kill them in their sleep or something, right? After all, this is supposed to be a video game where you can do whatever you want. But you can't! If you try to chop their door down with the axe at night, it'll just inform you that they're sleeping.

So as I'm starting my game I'm just waiting for a Fallout 3-esque menu to pick what skills I want to level up, and I wanted to play this game being as stealthy as possible. But unfortunately, there's no leveling up system, no weapons, no combat, nothing! We live in the year 2013, where gaming has evolved into a beautiful way to escape reality, and they weren't even bothered to add something that makes it feel like you're playing a game? Even games from the 1970s had combat! Like, Nintendo, seriously? If you're going to make an open world game, at least try to make it PLAY like an open world video game!

Now, enough about the things you CAN'T do. Let's talk about the things you CAN do. You can pluck weeds. Go fishing. Talk to neighbors (With only ONE THING TO SAY to them, as opposed to having many conversation choices in games like Fallout 3 and Mass Effect) Catch bugs. Sell stuff. Pay off your house. Make your house bigger. Decorate your house. Yes, I'm talking about a VIDEO GAME. Doesn't it sound like things your mom would ask you to do? Aren't those the kind of things you play video games to escape from?

The beautiful thing about video games are that they dump you in a world where you can be whatever you want, they make you feel like somebody you could never dream of being. You can fight enemies, kill innocent people, you can be anybody you want to be! But in this game, all you can be is a stupid little kid who does chores. That's what this game should be called: ""Stupid Little Kid Who Does Chores"".

If you're looking to bore yourself to sleep, or if you're like a 3 year old baby, then by all means, purchase this game. It's definitely up your alley.

The later chapters feature major slowdown which is horrible especially for a game that looks like it could of been released in 2005. The only fun part of the single player campaign is the goliath. Other than that it's as generic as you can get. It's more generic than Medal of Honor (2010) release. I wonder how much they payed the writer because if I was THQ I would ask for my money back. I mainly bought the game for multiplayer and that's been a HUGE disappointment. Servers were not working at all. When I finally got to play a few rounds that matches last less than 5 minutes for Ground Control. Death Match is filled with snipers who can kill with one shot across the map. The game also suffers from major lag. This is the first game I've played on dedicated servers and it runs worse than Black Ops which is peer 2 peer. I can't believe this game was released for 60 dollars and like a lot of people here I ended up buying it the release date and got shafted by the price drop. I will never buy another game from KAOS studios.

UPDATE - I have been reading reports that a lot of people are experiencing a major bug that will freeze your game at the splash screen due to the Battlecode they inputed. This renders your 50 dollar plus purchase useless and they still haven't put out a patch for this. Way to go THQ. Not only have you not fixed your server issues (half of the time it logs me out in the middle of a match and won't let me log back in), you have created a bug that renders the game unplayable to the purchaser. Maybe it's a blessing in disguise so they won't have to experience this horrible game. My advice to anyone looking to pick this up don't.

Some are good, but few know about them, such as Pax Imperia: Entiment Domain (one of my favorites). Some are good, and everyone who knows the genre exists knows the game, such as Master of Orion 2. Some are just colasal flops, and usually for many different reasons.
Do I have experience enough to judge a good 4X game? Well, I have played many of the games, but some disagree with my views on them. Here are the ones I have. My all time favorite, Pax Imperia: Entiment Domain; Master of Orion 2, one of my less favorites; Space Empires 4, in the middle of my list; Conquest: Frontier Wars gets second place; Star Wars: Rebelion, had potental, but didn't quite deliver; Star Trek: Birth of the Federation, also had potential, but didn't quite deliver. And that's all I can think of right now.
Anyway, on to Master of Orion 3. The prequel, MoO2 was many people's favorite, and it was good for when it came out (though I prefered Pax Imperia: Entiment Domain), but I wasn't one of it's biggest fans. Now MoO3 is a different story. I didn't actually buy it mind you. I got the full version 60 minute demo, and it was terrible. Although better visually than most, the menus and selection are very poorly done and getting anything done is nearly impossible. I didn't see the battles, but that makes no difference if the main interface is so bad you can't get anything done. There is little helpful information for running your empire.
All-in-all, this game isn't worth the time of day. If you want a 4X game, I reccomend getting Conquest:Frontier Wars, MoO2, or Space Empires 4. I haven't tried Galactic Empires yet, but it looks cool, so that could be a possibility. But this isn't the game that you are looking for. So hit the back button, and move on.

But the control system--terrible. The way the world whips around constantly at the slightest mouse movement made me want to throw up. You'd think you could fix this tendency by altering the mouse sensitiviy, but you'd be wrong. At the lowest setting BO2 still resembles the jerky camera parts of Saving Private Ryan--and I mean that in a bad, unexciting way. Also, what's up with no strafe controls? You can't bind any keys to move your player sideways. When you get in a fight the keys that previously and redundantly (since the mouse does that already) rotated the character are mysteriously transformed into the missing strafe keys. Why Eidos would abandon the tried-and-true Quake-type controls in this game is a mystery. I suspect it's an artifact left over from BO2's console port. With its whacky control system, the hardest part about BO2 is keeping your lunch down.
Also, parents should take note of the ""Mature"" rating for this game. If ever a game deserved an ""M"" rating (or worse), this one does. This is coming from someone who's enjoyed other ""M"" rated games like Soldier of Fortune which features gory, war-type violence directed at armed soldiers (with a penalty for killing civilians). But Blood Omen 2 takes violence in a very dark direction. As a vampire you're encouraged to view humans as food and feed on them wherever you find them. In practical terms, this includes walking up to old ladies and clubbing them to death as they scream for you to stop. They fall down and try to crawl away while begging for their life and you have to beat them to death before you drink their blood (necessary to refill your health meter). While I generally view ""kills"" in video games as cartoonishly entertaining, I found this level of violence disturbing. I suppose it's passed off as ""natural"" vampire behavior (though I wonder about the public response if these were, say, Harp seals being clubbed instead of people). Everyone's got their own standard regarding game violence. Mine's pretty liberal, but this is the first game that made me feel like I'd seriously signed up with the Dark Side.

Everything else you need to know: The engine and the framework of the game is perfectly fun, but the entire experience is washed over by the insultingly bad writing and character development. By the end of the play through you start to realize that there are entire sections of game that you expected by watching all of the previews and yet never got to experience.

The Joseph DeMarco scene could specifically be called out as a prime example of what the Ubisoft team promised, however, that scene was almost entirely cut out and what was left was hastily re-used and written over for some completely left-field mouse character that holds zero relevance to the plot and serves only to distract and confuse the entire story.

A pure example of flimsy character development would be Aiden Pearce's original motivation, which is to pursue someone in anger after they made threats about a family member. Aiden Pearce's first move, then, is instantly to threaten that character's family members without ever caring that that was the very kind of action that had driven him to action in the first place.

The other characters are reduced to worn out stereotypes and tropes, and the Ubisoft team was apparently not afraid to seem racist or sexist in their characters. I can only count one female character who isn't brutalized by violence, and she is in the game for maybe 60 seconds. She's supposed to be a psychiatrist, but she's used only as a babysitter. There are zero non-white characters who aren't portrayed as uneducated violent thugs.

I loved the demo and was looking forward to playing the full game. I just today rented it and started playing it and was truly enjoying the game.

This game could've been great. It should've been great. It had so much potential. And it is different. It truly is unlike most games that come out. It has the player utilize the environment to escape the ever vigilant waves of police, both on foot and in the air via helicopter. The emphasis is on exploration and evasion.

Unfortunately this is one reason why combat is so short-changed. On the times when the only options are to fight or die (and there are plenty of them) the combat is extremely difficult. Many fights can be avoided but for some the only way to avoid being ventilated is to take down the enemy.

And as I write this I do so after attempting to escape the mall. There is a section which no matter what I do, I die. If I fight the SWAT, I die. If I try to wall run to the pipe I am supposed to swing from then leap to the catwalk above and then the next section, somewhere in there I die. Either I miss because there is so much gunfire and small, minute changes in direction that are crucial to making the jump successfully are impossible to make (you'll get shot since Faith, the lead character, can't seem to shimmy over on the pipe any faster) If I actually do make the jump and land, it doesn't matter because I become a lead sponge.

Another large problem that bogs this game down is the simple fact that the shooting never seems to stop. There are far too few respites and these all stop far too quickly, forcing the gameplay to be relegated to repetitive and annoying. I was hoping to be able to explore and look at the city in all of its beauty. Unfortunately the constant gunfire makes this goal impossible.

Speaking of repetitive, the game would've been far better if it wasn't so linear. The devs hint at looking for alternative paths. Don't bother looking for them. They don't exist. The game has one way it wants you to complete an area and it will beat you over the head until you figure out what that one way is. Until then you will see ""Loading"" many, many times.

And it's a real shame too because some of the most exhilarating gaming moments that a player may see can be found in this game. Without giving anything away, the subway has one such moment, as does a construction level. There's a really good chase scene fairly early in the game too. Immersion is handled extremely well. For years gamers could never see their hands or feet. In this game they can and the camera never pans out. Ever. If you make a roll, the camera will do a very fast 360, just like in real life. As you run you see your hands moving back and forth quickly and they change position as you gain momentum, and Faith's breathing gets heavier as she runs faster and for longer periods of time.

Dice, in the slight chance someone from your company reads this, in the future, don't just test your game for bugs and glitches. Test the game to ensure that it will be fun. Don't give us a great concept and bog it down with terrible, frustrating gameplay. I do understand that you're owned by EA Games, the Walmart of the video game industry but I am sure that even they are willing to give you a little more time to work on the game and ensure that gamers will thoroughly enjoy what you have to offer.

In all honesty Dice, I truly do want to see a sequel to this game. I do want to see this franchise succeed. I want to see you take video gaming in a new direction and I believe that this game is that first step, so I am saying all of this in the hopes that when you take that next step, it will be a good one. I really did not want to write this. I did not start playing Mirrors Edge hoping to find things to criticize. I really wanted to enjoy this game and I am truly saddened that I simply cannot do so. Please make another game that is like this one, only without the needless frustrations. If you do that, and you can find ways to improve on what you did right, and you did do a lot right, then perhaps my future reviews of your games will look more like the other two that are here on Amazon as of the time of this writing.","Excellent Original Concept, Inexcusably Terrible Execution",1226707200,65,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

I couldn't get pass the first level. The entire game looks like a huge oil slick was dumped on everything. One can barely make out characters or details because of the ugly color scheme and detail given to everything. The story is cheap and stupid - rather than provide an intriguing storyline and main character, the player is given cuss words and a main character that's about as ugly and filthy as his language. The combo system is clunky, frustrating, and pointless. Hell, the main character should be able to curse everyone out and just walk off. That's how the fight system should've been. Choose the best cuss word and watch what happens.

It's a stupid game developed by stupid people that knew they could cash in easily with the use of strong language that (mostly kids, wink wink) would be shocked at. I'm sure they were pissed with the M+17 rating as this game clearly was not targeting an intelligent, 20yr old+ audience.

1.0,False,"08 20, 2010",A2YSUZ7R9AGJIU,B001Q9XT8E,Robby R.,"This guitar controller, as all of the Guitar Hero controllers, suffers from one problem that hasn't yet been fixed: Loose fret buttons. They required some breaking-in on the original Guitar Hero 2 white XPLORER guitar controller, but over time, even though the frets have changed slightly, problems with buttons not reading as being held down continues to be the biggest problem. I suppose it can really be blamed on the construction of the controller itself. The buttons wiggle in their holes. They aren't loose like about-to-fall-out-of-the-guitar loose, but it means you might pinch the edge of a button thinking you have it pushed down, and then you go to strum the note and you miss it. It's incredibly frustrating for someone like me. I play on Expert, and am constantly trying to better my score. And when you can't trust the controller you're using the fun is immediately sucked out of the game for me.

The strum bar is the other way that this guitar controller fails miserably. For me, anyways. I play left, and so I technically play the guitar upside down. Maybe as a righty it isn't so bad, but to play this guitar as a lefty, when I down-strum, you have to push it nearly to its stop in order for the guitar to register a strum. So if I'm playing, but the notes aren't coming down the track fast enough that I would need to use up and down-strums, I have to shove the strum bar all the way down every time. It completely ruins the fun of playing, and I'm sure only ruined the strum bar on the guitar further.

Now in fairness, I let my brother use this one when we played Rock Band since he's right-handed, and  the strum bar seemed to work fine for him. But since I'm lefty, I really can't give this any higher a rating. Oh it has a detachable neck and a two-color sunburst. Well congratulations, but I'm getting tired of these guitars being all glitter and no grit. It can't stand up to someone who needs to use this to seriously PLAY it. Imagine using a regular XBOX 360 controller to play a game in which you use A, B, X and Y equally, but one of the buttons sticks and the right joystick only works sometimes. It would immediately take all the fun out of playing the game.

The detachable neck is my final complaint and the final straw for me. Quite a few times while I was playing through World Tour (which is a fine game, aside from this awful controller), the game would suddenly stop reading any of the notes I was playing. After a few times I realized it was because when you lock the neck into place it still slides a little, so you have to be careful when you're playing not to pull the neck away from the body. Honestly, the construction was so poor here I don't know what they were thinking.

The battle system is atrocious. The only times it truly shines are in boss fights, and more often than not, you are too busy trying not to get utterly destroyed to appreciate how well it actually does work in those rare occasions.

The summons are entirely pointless and were only put in the game arbitrarily, because most FF games have summons - Eidolons have been in the game before. You can only use one eidolon in a battle, and probably only once. Only the party leader can use their eidolon. Eidolons really don't do much damage, either.

There are no towns. There's one big town, aka planet like Coruscant, but even within that town you don't ever experience a traditional RPG experience where you go in Inns and shoppes and whatnot. You do all your shopping through computer terminals.

By the end of the game, if you suffer long enough to make it to Orphan's Cradle, you'll hate it. You'll fight only massive groups of enemies, each of which can easily kill your entire party on its own. Assuming you care enough to make it through the last chapter, you'll get a disappointing ending.

I own a PS3 and when someone said, ""No PS button"" I realized that it was off my list as a possibility but after reading through the reviews I realized that there were probably a lot of people who would not understand what this means - and were they buying a controller the same day they were buying a PS3, well, they might consider this - Logitech is a good name in keyboards and they usually get it right.

The PS button serves as an ""on"" button when the PS3 is off, thus allowing you to turn on the PS3 from the controller.  (This works whether the controller is wired or wireless).  When playing PS2 games on the PS3, you need to push the PS button to reinitialize the controller when stopping or starting the game.  When playing PS2 games, you use virtual memory chips that are stored on the hard drive - you ""break out"" of the game to move the chips to different slots using the PS button.  Some games only access the first of the two virtual slots, some access both of them but won't switch where they will save, but you can get the same function as you would with physical chips by breaking into the monitor and moving virtual chips from slot to slot while the game is running (but suspended).

When you want to stop a game, ps2 or ps3, you hold the PS button for a couple seconds and a menu comes up.  This allows you to determine the state of charge of your controller if you are using it wirelessly, turn off one controller, turn on a controller (so that you can join a game) renumber controllers and so on and so forth.  It also provides the only access that allows you to stop a game - which allows you to access the browser that is built in to the system, download demos and complete games and upgrades that might be available through the Sony store and so forth.

The point is that without the PS button, the controller is more or less useless - especiallly for PS2 games because they require that you press them to initialize the controller when you start the game. I'm not sure how I could use it - there may be some other way for it to get initialized.

Now, I'm currently playing ""Blazing Angels: Squadrons of WWII"".  I've managed to get as far as the first battle of Midway.  It is a game which can be played with or without the tilt - and when the tilt is on, there are two patterns of controls - one puts the rudder on the second stick so that it does the same thing the pedals normally do and that is the one I use.

But it would not be a good game without the tilt. I've played it both ways, and, well, tilt just wins.  There are a ton of things I hate about the PS3 stock controller (the biggest of which is that the ""L2"" and ""R2"" can be hit accidentally too easily, you have no idea how many times I accidentally dropped hand grenades in Tomb Raider - Legend while picking up the controller after a break), but I won't replace it with something that does not have a PS button, and I probably won't replace it with something that does not have the sixaxis stuff.  Yes, that probably means I'll be using Sony controllers forever...but Sony could license the fan from Logitech.

I expect more games to put real function on the tilt in the future.  That will further make controllers like this one less than useful.  Maybe there will be a version two with tilt and a PS button - I'd kinda like a bigger controller myself.",PS Button,1174348800,18,,

After all, in the late 80's early 90's I really enjoyed this game.  It was really something to have.  Years later it's apparent of two things: The game was horribly designed, and it CAN'T stand the test of time.  The fact that on Nintendo's VC it's also a dollar more than the other NES games is also questioning.  It's hard to make a game this bad.

If you were a fan of the Turtles a long time ago back in the early 90's the first thing you'll notice about the game is that it hardly has anything to do with the show at all outside of some of the major characters.  Outside of that there are no foot soldiers, and most of the enemies you encounter you never saw in the show in the first place.  You will come across Bebop and Rocksteady but none of the other enemies were actually ever in the show in the first place.  Kind of daunting.

What really makes the game horrible, however, lies within the gameplay.  Firstly, the turtles themselves are unbalanced and put to unfair use.  You can switch between any of the turtles at a time, but for the most part, only one of them is of any use to getting you through the adventure.  Michaelangelo and Raphael are completely useless, as their weapons lack to the range to actually do anything.  Leonardo is alright, but Donatello is the only real useful one here, as he's the only one who can attack downward and at a range.  More than likely you'll only want to use the other three to sacrifice so that Donatello can do some beating up on enemies.

The way the levels are designed is also horrendous.  You basically walk around an overworld map and go into sewers, warehouses and whatnot.  The problem is that you never know where to go next.  This non-linear style wouldn't be so bad if there weren't so many blasted dead ends.  To make the experience even more grueling, the game is just FULL of enemies that will respawn almost the second you turn around.  You could go through a tough warehouse fighting tons of tough enemies, only to find you can't go any further.  So now you'll have to backtrack and you may have to fight all those enemies again.  So if you don't lose a turtle getting to a dead end, you'll probably lose him getting from it.

The game isn't really difficult, it's just unfair and frustrating.  The fact that two of your four players are completely useless tells you something.  The later turtles games were far better than this.  Skip the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game.  It's so unfair that the experience is frustrating.  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II and III were far better, and there's still no turtles game that beats the all time best: Turtles IV: Turtles in Time.

They are terrible because the pseudo computer systems they are played on are weak and there are huge differences between what a $300 machine can do vs a $3000 machine.  Still, it is shocking the low quality that the console fanbois have convinced themselves is worth their time.

Unfortunately, part of the delusion is writing fabulous reviews about incredibly inferior products like Dark Souls and outright lying about it.  This is NOT an RPG.  It does not even bother to provide a cogent backstory.  In true testament to the delusion, there are hours of youtube video by some people with really vivid imaginations that make up what would have been a great story....but nowhere in the game is any of their fantasy more than hinted at.  Unless there is a manga out there with hundreds of pages of fiction this game is based on, the devs were incredibly lazy and did not bother to do any of this basic work.  What is Dark Souls about?  Undead?  The gods?  Good vs evil? Magic?  Some sinister enemy?  You wish.  Literally.  All that is basically left blank.  Nice.  Amazing that a third game comes out and no back story.

Which leaves the play style.  It's terrible.  This is button mashing, arcade garbage.  Enemies are either ludicrously easy or need to you to do a specific pattern of moves in a specific order with no real reason why.  You learn to do them by rote, no skill involved and as far as I can tell, they don't match anything going on the screen.  The main bosses don't even have anything remotely like modern style AI.  They do what they do, basically ignoring what you do and if you hit the right sequence of buttons you win.

Ten years ago, that was unacceptable.  Today, there are better games for handheld portables.

Understand...this game is not ""different"".  Nor is it misunderstood.  Not is it an acquired taste.  It's pathetically inferior.

Right from the start I'm like...why is there no automap.  Ooooh, that's why...the levels are extremely basic.....because that is all an Xbox can render.

1.0,False,"03 14, 2013",A259W5KIP41XFL,B000G0HJ3K,Jennifer A. Everhart,"You know, I have been a huge Sonic fan for as long as I can remember, right down to the Genesis days.  I know that the 3D Sonic games tend to have a polarizing reputation, but in all honesty, I liked most of his 3D outings, with the only two exceptions being the SD version of Unleashed, which wasn't bad by any means, but I preferred the HD version (which I am going to discuss later on), and THIS!  Okay, so the gist is that Sega had to rush the game into stores in order to meet the 15th anniversary deadline so they could remain financially stable, and it really shows.  One the one hand, I do admire how it tries to recapture the ambition of the Adventure duology & Shadow the Hedgehog, but when it misses, it really misses.  First, let's look at the story.  Sonic decided to go on a vacation in Soleanna, the City of Water, where they are celebrating the Festival of the Sun.  Just as when its princess, Elise, lit the giant torch in the center of the city, Dr. Eggman with a new and pretty odd appearance, arrives and captures Elise to seek the Flames of Disaster, despite Sonic's best efforts to save her, but she gives him the blue Chaos Emerald.  So, Sonic teams up with Tails and Knuckles to rescue Elise, investigate the mystery of the Flames of Disaster Eggman mentioned, rinse and repeat about six times, and there you have Sonic's story.  Shadow's story is that he and Omega broke into Eggman's base to rescue Rouge and retrieve the Scepter of Darkness.  However, at the rondevux point, Eggman knocks the scepter out of Rouge's hands and causes it to shatter, freeing an entity known as Mephiles who took on Shadow's appearance as he was the one who sealed him inside ten years before using time travel.  There is also the newcomer, Silver, who came from a future devastated by Iblis and enlisted the help of Blaze from Sonic Rush, who possibly warped there and lost her memory for some reason.  Since Iblis keeps healing despite their best efforts to take it down, they run into Mephiles who uses Chaos Control for them to travel back in time in order to kill Sonic, who Mephiles prophecised to be the so-called ""Iblis Trigger"", and it becomes one big, convoluted, contradictory, stupid, melodramatic, & plot hole-laced adventure with a revolting love story between Sonic & Elise for good measure.  Wrap your head around that.  In addition to the 4kids voice cast, there was also Lost in Space survivor Lacey Chabert as the voice of Elise, who also made a guest appearance in the Black Christmas remake the exact same year.  To be fair, Chabert's voice in general can be annoying at times, but she at least tries acting-wise.  She, along with Mike Pollock as Eggman & Dan Green as Mephiles, were the three best voice actors in this game.  Everyone else's talents were wasted by the material they had to work with.  As far as the gameplay is concerned, I do admire how it tries to recapture what made Adventure 1 & 2's gameplay so special to me and try not to make the same mistake Heroes made in having the playable characters, stages, and bosses virtually the same; and the music is pretty cool.  However, it was bogged down by some fatal flaws.

1. It suffers from the exact same problem as Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly which I reviewed two years ago.  A lot of the glitches can be game-breaking and they have become the butt of a joke on Youtube, right down to Knuckles & Rouge getting stuck to the wall on occasion, characters running off loop-de-loops and falling to their deaths, etc.

2. What is up with the excessive load screens?  One way I can sum them up is talk to somebody, load screen, they tell you the objective, load screen, you do the mission, load screen, they congratulate you on a job well done, results, ANOTHER LOAD SCREEN!  Trust me.  Extensive loading can leave some people bored out of their minds, especially when you take into account of how tedious the side missions can be for some reason.

3.  Some of the character bosses can be pretty cheap, such as Silver when he constantly throws you at nearby walls using telekinesis without giving you any time to react while shouting ""It's no use"" over and over again.  The same can go for the opposite side of the spectrum when you play as Silver and you can just throw items and debris at Sonic & Shadow, and you win, kind of like in the horrible Karate Kid 3 when Daniel threw one punch at Mike Barnes and he won the fight.  At least the character battles in Sonic Adventure 1 & 2 were fair.  To be fair, the remaining bosses at least had more emphasis on strategy than the ""attack repeatedly"" no-brainer ones from Heroes, but still could have used some extra work.

4. Despite being able to roam around freely and it is not on-rails, the controls were mind-blowingly awful.  It doesn't look bad when you watch gameplay videos, but trust me, it's bad.  A lot of the characters' maneuvering felt way more slippery, clunky, and sensitive than other 3D Sonic games combined and the attacks felt so awkward and stiff that I usually get hit first.  It is hard to do controls justice and that, along with the ""where the *@&+ do I go"" level design, cheap obstacles, etc., is what killed the game for me, so the true way to know is to play it yourself, and to quote Chris McCleen from Total Drama Island, I triple dog dare you.

There are more reasons why this game became the Sonic series' crowning achievement of failure, but this review was getting long as is.  If you want to know every single solitary little thing that was wrong with it, I would suggest watching ClementJ642's 7-part rant.  I would put part one's web link below, but Amazon always deletes the link to prevent people from navigating away from the site, so I would do a search on Youtube for ""ClementJ642 Sonic 2006 Review"" to check it out when you have the time on your hands.  With that said, I will see you guys later, and the later 3D Sonic games are miles better than Sonic 2006 in execution.","To quote the Angry Video Game Nerd, this is, beyond any doubt, the worst 3D Sonic game I have ever played.",1363219200,,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

Loving flying games so much, I always find value on games that most casual gamers dislike. There was very little to appreciate in this game. I'm going to start out by listing the positives.
*Short Campaign (This is a POSITIVE?! Yes.)
*Single Player Achievements are easy

Like a sucker, I actually pre-ordered this game (360) when it came out maybe six months ago. I am writing a review for it so late after I purchased the game because when the game came out it was virtually unplayable. The game would FREEZE in single player. Allllllll the time. I put the disk in last week, there was an update, and the game no longer froze, so I figured it would be a good time to beat it and get it over with.

The patch fixed the straight up freezing, BUT there are still a ton of bugs. Over the past few days:
*When flying to an objective, the ground/buildings disappeared, and I flew around until my plane exploded.
*After dying once, I respawned with only 1 missile. I would fire it, wait for a long time for it to reload, fire again.
*Game started lagging (single player) on several missions, audio disappeared

Multiplayer:
Doesn't exist. Yes, the game supports it, and yes there are tons of achievements for multiplayer, but I've never found anyone online when trying to play it. If you are trying to get these achievements, hit me up, and maybe we can test out this multiplayer.

Gameplay:
The biggest mistake was playing the first half of the missions on ""Easy"". I switched to ""Hard"" and noticed virtually no difference in difficulty level. Play this game on hard, get all the achievements at once.

The gameplay is horrible in that planes fly in straight lines and spam missiles. Good luck trying to stall the airplane. Even on ""Hard"", there is a minimum airspeed. You can hold the break and fly 90* straight up, the plane will not stall. Flight physics are non-existant. Planes don't really behave differently. They look different, act about the same.

Missions are repetitive and easy. Throw on some long range AA missiles, shoot down all aircraft from long range, switch to long range AG missiles and take out all ground targets from so far away they cannot hit you. This game really isn't worth getting into much, nothing remarkable.

Should you buy this game? YES!!!!! If:
1) You already have all other flight games for xbox, and beat the crap out of IL2, Birds of Prey, Blazing Angles, Ace Combats, etc.
2) You love flight sim games and you want them ALL
3) You want some achievements

I configured the Windows audio to use the USB for communications and the Optical for sound. The instructions are pretty vague but it isn't too difficult to figure out.

I charged the headset fully. Then I put them on to try them out and to my horror there was a constant buzz in the right channel. Not a blow my ears out buzz but a nice low annoying buzz like electronic interference generated by computer equipment if you know what I mean. It didn't change frequency often but does alternate once in a while between two different pitches. It persisted in the background and was audible through music and sounds during quieter spots.

I tried disconnecting from my PC thinking it was the source but it still persisted. I tried putting a ferrite core on the USB cable and it didn't help. Even when I power the base off and plugged my cell phone directly into the headset with the included cable it persisted.

I normally use a set of Corsair Vengeance 2000 wireless headphones on my PC and a set of Ultimate Ears TripleFi 10 earphones everywhere else.

In my testing I found the sound to be average at best. The bass was there but the mids and highs sounded off to me. Especially the highs sounding harsh to me. I even think the Turtle Beach PX4 wireless headphones sounded better than these and I wasn't too crazy about those either.

Nothing else I could say about this headset really matters with the constant buzzing problem. It is unacceptable to me. I did a search for afterglow buzzing and found lots of hits for PDP headphones, this and other models. Maybe I got a bad set but with the number of hits I got in my search I question the quality control or maybe even the overall design.

They always take the novel, fun concept of the original, and ruin it by adding tons of complications to it.  Thats the case here, more complex dosnt mean more fun.

All the new features are ok in theory, but of course very few of them actually work the way they're supposed to.  Even after patching to 1.2, sometimes i'll get piles of ""gong"" all over the castle, while my gong farmers just stand around doing nothing.  The only fix for this seems to be deleting all my structures, and then starting over.

The first Stronghold focused mainly on defense, with only a few attack missions.  I found that to be a very nice change of pace, i don't recall ANY game that ever focused purely on defense before.  Of course, the second one seems to mainly be an attack based game.  The castles aren't nearly as strong as they were in the first one.  Most siege weapons can destroy even the strongest castle in a matter of seconds (as well as your brave defenders now).  But the gameplay and features of the game are moot points, the big problem is the game flat out dosnt work.

The 3-d graphics suck, let's face it.  I'm not really picky about graphics, but whats strikes me is that the graphics are very poor...yet the game runs like it's Doom freaking 5; lots of waiting times and choppyness.  In fact, the game itself can take upwards of around 3-5 minutes just to boot up.  This is on a high end gaming computer as well.

What really upsets me though, is i tried playing the game all the way through, even though i didn't really enjoy it all that much.  I got about halfway, and then suddenly the game just started crashing every 15 seconds on a particular mission.  I wrote tech support, and after about a week of writing back and forth, their only suggestion was to reinstall the game.  I did that, started all over, enjoying it even less this time and when i got to that mission again, i found it still crashed.  As it is now, the game is completely unplayable, and i've given up.

Experience:

Level 1: Begins with cover based shooting. Glad to see Capcom is blazing new trails in the 3rd person shooter genre. Also you can't ""vault"" over cover. I mean it only took them how ever many years to give you the ability to run AND shoot. Maybe in 3 more games they'll include this option.

Cover based shooting takes forever. Your guns are inaccurate, head shots don't drop enemies, frag grenades do pitiful damage, enemies take entire clips to the chest (on normal difficulty), and the only thing more inaccurate that you with guns is your NPC squad with guns.

Encounter Birkin boss fight. Birkin nails me with pipe and locks me in perma-stun until death. 2nd encounter knocks me down. This time analog prompt appears (rotate analog stick to dodge) to allow me to roll out of the way. Why it didn't appear in the first encounter I have no idea.

Birkin kills squad member, move to revive...die
New strategy: Use squad as meat shield, sprint like crazy while hearing their cries of anguish fade into the distance...pass level.

Level 2: Unlock stealth for Vector. Encounter military types in City hall. Stealth and sneak up behind enemy when I realize I have no stealth kill...on a STEALTH character. Sigh, in perfect position to set up cross fire. Execute..enemy begins melee combo attack while I'm pouring a clip into his chest. Locked into perma-stun until death.

Crossfire attempt 2: Watch my team flail about as if they're trying to target everyone at once and some enemies that don't exist. Use all stun grenades. Team refuses to acknowledge my assistance by actually killing a single soldier. Survive encounter with 1 bar of health. Remaining squad memebers...KIA. Developing hatred toward moron in charge of AI.

Get to archive room to burn evidence. Can't see a thing. Turn up gamma no effect. Wander around library beginning to wonder if my purchase was worth it.

Get to ending with multiple Lickers. Watch as animators were too lazy to give the Lickers an actual ""death"" animation. Licker stays in attack pose after 2 clips or more until finally disintegrates; was dead the entire time. Other Licker models merely go ""limp"" and fall from the ceiling. Very lazy on Capcom's part.

Level 3: Exploding zombies...this is getting stupid. Am becoming bored, and really wishing I'd read the reviews.

Hospital catches fire. Hunter mini boss fight occurs.
Use team as meat shield. Hunter kills ""Lupo"" and ""Beltway"" but I'm alive and that's what's important.
Revive Lupo. Revive Beltway. Beltway then runs directly into a fire and stands there until he dies. Revive Beltway. Move to next room. Lupo suicides on trip mines that were guarding an aid spray. She can't even pick them up! Why is she going for an aid spray!?

Turn game off in disgust.

Update: Continued to play and got to one of the end levels where I had to re-enter Birkin's Lab.
On the elevator and attacked by lickers. Killed lickers but one glitches and gets stuck in the freaking wall. My cracker-jack team decides the best thing to do is to just shoot the wall...forever. After the Licker has disappeared through the wall. I am not kidding. They all lined up and proceed to shoot at NOTHING. And because you can't issue team commands, the only way to make them stop is proceed to another check point.

This is one the biggest things that I am hating about the game industry. EVERYTHING MUST have multi-player.
I know that a ton of people who disagree with me will say ""Play on Xbox Live DURRR""
The thing is that I shouldn't have to. That's an excuse and bull**** one at that.
I understand that there are some games that have a single player campaign added as an after thought. Battlefield Bad Company 2 is a perfect example. I didn't get that impression from ""RE: ORC."" I thought it was going to be a mixture of Dead Space, and Gears of War. A solid single player experience with a strong multi-player element. And Capcom was more than happy to make people believe that. Instead they give me an amalgamation of Gears of War, Jericho and Vampire Rain.

From the moment I first got into the game I was let down by intro music.  It's depressing and horrible (not bad musically, it actually makes you *feel* horrible though).  That might have been ok if not for the fact that it's the basic music track for the ENTIRE GAME.  The musical score varies slightly but not enough to hardly ever make you think you're not in the main menu for the rest of the game.  It's too bad because the original Crysis and Crysis Warhead had excellent musical scores.

The gameplay feels extremely uninspired, as if the developers played Call of Duty too much.  In fact, the entire game feels like it was ripped off from OTHER games.  It feels nothing like Crysis at all!  During gameplay, certain sections reminded me sooo much of Call of Duty...other sections reminded me of Time Shift while still others reminded me of Half Life, and the alien foot soldiers were such a ripoff of Halo.  It was so weird because playing this game was reminiscent of every other game EXCEPT for Crysis.

And the worst part about this game is that it's not even fun after about 30 minutes.  Finishing the game was such a chore.  I found myself wishing the game would be over soon so I could simply find out how it ends and sell it off to someone.

The graphics are a MAJOR step backwards and if I were the developers I'd be embarrassed about releasing this game.  Every time you launch the game you're forced to watch an unskippable splash screen telling you this game was made with the CryEngine 3--like it's something to brag about.......more like CryEngine 0.5.

The only thing good about this game is that you now have hot keys for the suit powers, HOWEVER you had to give up your 'Q' and 'E' lean keys for it.  You are allowed to lean at certain times, but only if you are positioned just right at a pre-approved wall.  It's part of the new cover system that was (AGAIN!) ripped off from Gears of War.  But it doesn't always work!  It's so frustrating when the previous Crysis games didn't have these kinds of problems at all!  The A.I. is quite challenging with both humans and aliens this time (as opposed to only the aliens being challenging in the original Crysis), but it doesn't make up for the fact that now they all fight you in exactly the same way AND the aliens are now red instead of being blue like they were in the original Crysis.  Oh my goodness!  It's like the developers forgot they even made Crysis and Crysis Warhead!

And be sure to turn on subtitles otherwise you'll miss the last 1/3 of what people are saying.  This happened a lot too.  You would be in the middle of conversing with someone about what you were supposed to do and the voice just ends while the subtitles keep on going.  Well, you don't really ""converse"" because throughout the entire game you are COMPLETELY SILENT (another Half Life ripoff) which is the exact opposite of the previous Crysis games.  And you are constantly being interrupted by cut scenes and finding yourself somewhere else in the city.  The previous Crysis games actually had some continuity to how you got to where you were, oftentimes even picking up exactly where you finished last time.

Even if you've never played the original Crysis I still can't recommend this game.  It's mediocre at best, with a horrible beginning and absolutely stupid ending that will only make you ask yourself why you just spent 8+ hours playing.  There are a few 10 minute segments that are fun but are completely ruined by the rest of the game.  Maybe if you got this game for multi-player it might have some redeeming qualities, but I was so disgusted with it after finishing the single-player campaign I sold it right away.

1.0,False,"04 17, 2012",A14QFQFF3ZX575,B002BSC54I,Kamiyama,"I love The Legend of Zelda. I played, beat, and loved the Zeldas for the NES, SNES, and N64. I didn't like Twilight Princess but Skyward Sword takes the cake as the worst Zelda game I have played to date. I will list my complaints as follows:

1. The motion controls suck. There is no way to work with them. I have tried adjusting my wii-mote sensitivity, I have moved my sensor bar, I have tried other wii-motes, but the motion controls just suck. I haven't been able to complete a number of side-quests because they don't respond to how I move the controller. In the bamboo-cutting minigame I can hold the wii-mote perfectly level, pointing straight at the sensor bar, and swing it perfectly horizontally in perfect 30 degree arcs however Link will swing his sword diagonally, and then do a spin attack even though I left the nunchuck sitting on the ground. You can't justify controls that suck this bad. Yes I might be able to beat the mini-game or side-quests after trying them over and over thousands of times, but it wouldn't be a victory of skill, it would be a victory of dumb luck - and that's all the stupid motion controls will let you have. Maybe Nintendo should fire their Japanese engineers and hire some Americans to make them some game controllers that actually WORK.

2. Puzzles are mind-numbingly simple. If I can figure it out in less than 30 seconds you just weren't trying hard enough. One particular puzzle in the pirate ship just irked me - you enter a room with a massive shaft of light coming down from the ceiling. Before I could even move, stupid Fi comes out and tells me that she can see the crystal on the roof through the hole in the ceiling. WHY? It would have taken me 5 seconds to figure that out, but now that you've gone and told me how to solve it, I can't even derive any enjoyment out of solving it! The puzzles are stupid, and anytime you get one that requires real thinking, they tell you how to do it!

3. I hate the golden harp. I loved the Ocarina in OoT - there were so many songs you could play, and you could even make your own! In particular I loved playing the Song of Storms inside the windmill, and watching the dude with the music box freak out. However instead of improving upon that game mechanic, they chose to simplify it. The harp has no notes and you can only strum it back and forth, and doesn't create anything I could describe as ""music"". All of the ""songs"" in this game sound so deafeningly horrible to my ears that I turn the volume down during music sequences. This is coming from someone who enjoys listening to Classical.

4. Fi is ugly. I normally enjoy seeing/playing female game characters and seeing them in many different graphics and art styles. However Fi just creeps me out. When she talks her mouth opens and closes like a ventriloquist's doll, which just makes the singing sequences scare the crap out of me. Also what is up with her outfit? I don't mind if a girl wears fishnet, but Fi is wearing laced-together jumper cables. Ugly, ugly, UGLY!

So far I have put over 100 hours into Skyward Sword and I think it is the worst in the series by far. Nintendo needs to buck up and make something that surpasses OoT, which I think they are capable of doing but they need to put some effort into it, and this game just seems like a half-hearted entry into the series.",viciously horrible game,1334620800,25,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

1.0,False,"04 2, 2006",A3JJNSW1XHXX9B,B0009N5O5E,HealthIT,"Initially, this game was really fun.  Good graphics, good team interface with voice chat and good stories.

A cleric in our guild hit level 10 in the first 3 weeks of gameplay and was capped on XP, and he stared alts.  My guild had over 300 players, most of which have dropped DDO.

The reason?  Content (or lack thereof).  You can do every quest in this game in about 1 month.  After that, you're just repeating the quests for XP to get your character leveled up.  And after you're capped at level 10, there's nothing more for you to do but start a new toon.

I like the many many people who are dropping DDO are disappointed.

Pros:  Its fun initially.  Thats about it.  Little content compared to almost any other mmorpg.

Cons:  Turbine seems not to care.  They should've started witht he Red Dragon and expanded from there.  Due to many complaints, they've just added 3 new quests... for low level players... wow, an extra day of gameplay.

""nerfing""  Every update, the developers seem to think it necessary to downgrade everything... (do they this will keep players around?)  For example, a begining level quest used to have an item that anyone could get that would cast 3 webs per rest... now its only 1.  They've made spells weaker and the enemies more resistant to everything from every class.  They've downgraded the items you get in chests etc.  They've downgraded vendor items as well.  You used to be able to get +3 or better enchanted items for the highest level vendors... now it is +1 stuff that the lower level vendors used to sell.  Good items are near impossible to find now, let alone buy.  They change gameplay often making it not as fun.  Once you get used to a spell, or a fighter move etc. working against an enemy, they change it so it doesn't.  What's the point.  They should just give us no powers or skills... that's where its heading.

I can't be more disappointed with this game.  It's just boring after you've done every quest in the game 3 times in less than a month.  This game sorely needs content.  Any other MMORPG has at least 50 times the content DDO does.  You're better off getting the 10day free trial... that's about all you'll need.  After that its a waste of money.  $50 for the game +$15 every month... for what?  They seem not to care that people on most servers are switching to other games with more content.  Maybe their happy with always having newbs and losing the hundreds of lvl 10 players.

Fun for a while... then you'll be looking elsewhere with more content.  You just don't get your money's worth with this game.

1.0,False,"05 8, 2002",A1LVMQ52YODRMO,B00005ME6O,sporkdude,"I never saw a horror-survival game before, and the idea of a spooky game intrigued me.  So, I rented Silent Hill 2.  I figured I would be scared out of my mind, battling monsters that pop up out of nowhere, hearing strange spooky sounds, basically playing the game on the edge of my seat.  How wrong I was.
First off, this is a sorry attempt at a game.  People say this is a puzzle game.  In it's loosest definition - yes it is.  The same way old games like King's Quest were puzzle games.  Basically, all you do is walk.  That's it.  You walk.  Really nothing else.  You walk and hope you find something.  Then you walk some more and hope that the thing you found works on something else.  That's it.  There's no complex or intriguing puzzle, it's just search around until you grab something.
That was cool, in the 1980s, when game makers needed to make 50 hour games while only developing a few background scenes and characters.  This is the 2000s, and there is no excuse for it now.
So, all you do is walk and fight or dodge an occasional monster.  That wouldn't be so bad - if they didn't make walking the most mind numbing experience in the world!  To move from one end of the street to the other takes forever.  The controls are sticky and clumsy, and the guy is really, really slow.  Since there's fog or darkness, you constantly have to check the map to see if heading in the next direction.
How about the environment?  Not once was I scared or awed.  The graphics are below par for a Playstation 2 game.  The fog is cool for a second, but annoys you afterwards.  The monsters are a joke.  They're little bodies that couldn't frighten a 8 year old girl loaded with caffeine.
Also, the ""puzzles"" are just plain ridiculous.  For example, here's what you have to do when you enter the town.  You're just in the town with no explicit instructions.  So you wander, then wander some more, then you finally find a key.  Big whoop, a key.  Then you wander some more to find where the key goes to.  So, after playing for an hour, you've opened a gate.  In Grand Theft Auto 3, you would have already killed a few people, and completed some fun missions.  In ICO, you would have explored a large castle, rescued a girl, and escaped dreadful spirits.  This game - you only opened a damn gate.  Once you're in the apartment building, you wander around rooms and hallways that look the same.  Finally, after another hour, what do you get?  A cool new weapon?  A great story cut-scene?  No - you get a flashlight.  What does the flash light do?  Reveal new secrets?  Find new terrifying monsters?  No - you can now read the map of the apartment building.  Two and a half of hours of game play, and I've done is enter an apartment building and looked at the map.  Bored already?
What's worse is when you need to something to continue the story, but they won't tell you what.  This means you could be conceivably stuck at one point for hours because of you didn't do something subtle in a room that is far at the other side of the apartment building.  Remember, moving to one side of the apartment building to the other is a major chore in itself.  After being stuck for a few hours because I didn't go outside and look in the dumpster and pick up a coin, I knew this game had no hope.  I continued on until I reached another apartment building that looked exactly the same.  I promptly shut off my PS2 and returned the game to [the store].
Finally, in order to save, you actually have to actively search out the save game places.  This was the final straw.
I kind of wanted to see the ending, but then I figured what it was.  Here's a spoiler for you.  The monsters that roam the town?  They're not trying to kill you.  Their the dead corpses of the players who were bored to death, warning you to return this game immediatately!
You want a good puzzle game?  Get ICO instead.  This game just plain [smells].  It stretches a small environment into a major chore in order to squeze some playabilty out of you.",Scariest part is that other people liked it.,1020816000,24,,

Pros
-Faster than previous Sims games
-Shorter loading screens
-Easier to pick up and less convoluted
-Nice music
-Pleasing graphics (though not really realistic)
-Multitasking for Sims

Cons
-Create-a-Sim gives you LESS potential to create unique Sims than in the past. It may look like an improvement at first glance, but it's not. Movement of facial features with the cursor is very limiting. There are not many color options, either.
-There are very few game options, which means less control over how your game works
-The UI is a bit more streamlined but still needs a lot of work (always an issue in The Sims, IMO)
-There are A LOT of loading screens
-LESS CONTENT; yes it's a base Sims game and this is always an issue with those (prior to EA's greedy DLC practice) but this one is far worse than previous games. There are many things missing from previous games, with very little added.
-The only available career choices are awkward and undesirable. There are no standard careers, such as business or law, just odd ones like astronaut.
-There are only two towns and they are TINY! That leaves little room for creating a lot of Sims and less time to enjoy the game. It gets old really fast.
-The camera SUCKS. It's full of issues (such as lagging screen edge scrolling) and there are very few options to modify it
-Building a house only has a few minor improvements over previous games.
-The new Sims emotions can be kind of cool at first but the novelty wears off fast. They can be annoying. Sims can die from idiotic things such as laughing (not as rare as they claimed it would be) or being mortified from a minor event, such as rejection.
-There just aren't that many improvements, period! This game offers practically nothing new to the series; it's just another way for EA to make $$$. It's dumbed down and ready for the DLCs for cash.

The game's main gimmick, the Absorption Dash, makes the gameplay a huge slog, since you are required to use it to kill enemies, and many enemies require quite a bit of ""softening up"" to become vulnerable to the dash. In addition, advanced techniques such as the crouch dash are not properly explained by the game, and combined with the strange, unforgiving level layouts, leads to a lot of deaths and wasted time. Powers are largely useless, since they mostly do not aid in speeding up (or eliminating) the process of having to absorb enemies. There is also a strange disconnect in stages where sometimes no difficulty is thrown at you, then you come across portions where the background can literally kill you or bosses suddenly require an insane amount of precision (and they too must be dashed into, lest they restore health and waste your time.)

Voice acting is uniformly terrible, especially combined with the cringe-worthy writing (which is filled with bad memes and puns-if you thought the trailer was bad, wait until you get your hands on the game!) The complete lack of facial animations during dialogue scenes also make the characters resemble creepy dolls rather than living beings.

Just like the resident evil ""HD"" versions I have done a full comparison on a 60GB ps3 with the game upscaled and smoothing off and guess what? its the same cept for the widescreen. ran the games through an emulator on a pc with max settings, way better, how a HD version should be.

I was enjoying the original Fallout 3 game too much, but the down loadable contents(DLC) were too glitchy to try again.
Now with a new company making the new installment, I hoped that the quality of the game would be better.  NO IT DIDN'T.  It's basically Fallout 3 with additional glitches that are too much to enjoy.  What is worst is that the glitches are so bad that it CORRUPTS saves.  So forget about continuing your progress, since they won't mean anything.

If you still want to purchase the game, then DON'T PURCHASE THE GAME for this console.  The Xbox 360 has a timed exclusive like Fallout 3.  Also, once the DLCs were available for the PS3 users, the DLCs were filled with glitches that were NEVER PATCHED.

I REALLY HATE THE WAY BETHESDA SOFTWORKS AND their scapegoat, Obsidian Entertainment.  SERIOUSLY, THEY MUST THINK PATCHES ARE A GREAT WAY TO MAKE GAMES.  THEY DON'T HAVE TO ACTUALLY FINISH THE GAME AND SEE THE QUALITY OF THE GAME IS GOOD ENOUGH TO PASS IT AS A FINISH GAME.

(Review of the game)
It's just one giant DLC.  Almost every part of the game is the same as Fallout 3.  The only differences are just the small details.  New additional weapons, trees, Vegas.  There are some good parts of the game, but there are just too much of the last game in this game that it's really not a new game.

It's much more harder than the last Fallout 3 game.  They went back to the original leveling up sequence from Fallout 1 and 2 where you can only get a perk after leveling up a few times, instead of leveling up every time.  Now you can get two more companions at the same time.  One is a living person and the other is a machine or mechanical one. Also, for Fallout 2 fans, this game does mention the tribal descendant, vault dweller as well as his/her's super mutant companion.  Arefu remind you of anything.

I rented this damn game, and, based on my experience, didn't taking advantage of Black Friday deals where this game was marked down to $34.99.  The game is just so badly made that I didn't want to help top this game as a best-seller.  As a PS3 owner, this time exclusives are worthless.  If you decided to stick it to your PS3 consumers, you can guarantee that some us are more interested in other games than your DLCs when it comes out.

Bethesda Softworks is a bad game company and their treatment towards PS3 consumers are horrible.

""Paper Mario Stick Star is a complete waste of a game and an insult to the Paper Mario franchise. There were more gameplay mechanics removed than there were added, and most of what remained in-game as previous mechanics were altered heavily in an effort to make the game ""good"", but in effect, turned the game into a stinking crap pile sprayed with that deodorant that I liked the smell of. Mmmm, this crap pile sure does smell good. I wonder what it's like? Well... crap. It's crap.""

Also, I'd like to add that I had pre-purchased the game, played most of it, saw the ending without beating it myself, and my opinion is valid in the sense that I know what I'm talking about when comparing the game (and gameplay) to the other, MUCH better games of the series.

Paper Mario 64 and Paper Mario: Thousand Year Door were both great games.  They both did the job well, were lots of fun, and did not reduce the amount of ""fluff"" that made the Paper Mario series so good as it progressed.  Super Paper Mario, while technically part of this series, obviously went for a ""Super Mario"" style of gameplay over the tradition RPG style.  This is acceptable.  It isn't a true turn-based RPG game.

Paper Mario Sticker Star took most of the fun features that I couldn't wait to sink my teeth into, and then tossed them into the garbage pan.  There was hot grease then poured into the can, and then the can was promptly lit of fire, shoved down a 30 foot hole and blown up with a grenade.  I feel that the extra measures to destroy the fun weren't justified, Nintendo.  They weren't justified at all.  Why are you so mean to me?

Previous games in the series contained, and Sticker Star does not:

  -Partner Characters with special abilities
  -Unlimited use of basic attacks
  -Special attacks.  By this I mean attacks that could be used whenever, but not forever, and under certain conditions.
  -Health... and Flower Points... a type of magic point system.  Something to MANAGE.  Something that was NOT a pain in the ass... like sticker collecting.
  -Peach cut-scenes with interaction.  I should say, ""Peach cut-scenes at all"".  ...eh, screw it.  A story involving Peach.
  -Items.
  -A large world with towns, connected with roads and places to visit.
  -Secret areas that were interesting and mattered.
  -A use for coins / money.
  -Badges and badge points.
  -Experience gain / Leveling up.
  -Upgrades, and with that, upgradable weapons.
  -That fortune teller lady.
  -Quests in any form.
  -Fun progression.
  -Much, much more.

Stuff in Sticker Star that previous games did NOT contain:

  -Use of 3D.

In a nutshell, the game is horrendously flawed. When you start playing it (and this is where I think most people are reviewing the game), it appears to actually be quite fun - you develop an economy, trade with Indians, make heaps of money, expand inland, build huge trade networks which make even larger heaps of money, reinvest the money into buying specialists who can refine your raw goods and produce *even more* money, and so on, all with a rather simplistic military system strapped on to allow raiding other colonies or stealing their cargo at sea.

The problem is, NONE OF THIS MATTERS. It's an awesome economic sim, where economics has nothing to do with winning the game. In fact, the larger and more successful your colony is, the harder it is to rebel, and the larger the expeditionary force you'll have to defeat to successfully win Independence. And successfully declaring Independence is the *only* way of winning the game, and you have to do it within 300 turns, which means that most of that uber-colony management stuff that makes it so great should never get used if you're trying to win the game.

In fact, 90% of the game is useless if you want to win. You basically have two options in the game: 1) Play it like a colony building sim, and trade and make lots of money, but lose, or 2) Win, but ignore all the economic stuff that makes the game great.

The problems are manifold - Independence can only be declared if you have ""liberty bell production"" at a certain rate, per person in your colony. All of your colonists (including your army, and people out building roads) count against this, but you can only have three units per city producing liberty bells. Even with every single one of my cities producing maximum liberty bells (with a Founding Father bonus, newspapers in every city, and three Elder Statesmen specialists in every town), I couldn't rebel. In fact, my Independence counter slid backwards, since my colony was doing great and expanding rapidly, all of which counted against the ability to go into rebellion.

The only way to win is to keep a small colony (or have lots of small cities) and burst liberty bell production - another screwed up mechanic is that the longer it takes you to rebel (i.e., the total number of bells producted), the larger the Royal Expeditionary Force gets -- and it grows exponentially. You can literally be making no headway (or going backwards, as I was, since my colony was expanding) but the REF will expand exponentially until you have next to no chance of being able to defeat the thousands of units coming your way.

Contrary to all logic and common sense, this is how I could have won: in order to boost Independence to 50%, I could have just killed off all my colonists, slaughtered my specialists, and just had nobody left alive but statesmen and my army. Then, with my colonists all pissed off at the king, for whatever reason, since I killed their next door neighbors and crippled their economy, could have bursted Statesmen, hit 50% Independence, and steamrolled their weak military since I wouldn't have produced bells up until that point.

It makes no sense, and I refuse to play it that way. It's really painful to say, but Firaxis really screwed up royally when they developed the mechanics for this game. They set one goal to the players -- develop an economically successful colony -- which is actually counterproductive to the real goal -- declare independence and defeat the REF. As a side note - the way the original Colonization did it worked differently - the more money the King got in taxes, the larger the REF got, which actually made some sort of common sense.

There's plenty of other issues as well:
-There's next to no reason to be mean to Indians - they're like these fairy godmothers that give you free resources, train your colonists, and serve as massive sources of money.
-There's next to no reason to be mean to the other colonies. Since you can do everything you want in the game with 1 to 3 cities (and cities take up half the space they do in Civ), there's really no competition for land in this game. There's also no military victory; in fact, if you waste your time fighting the other colonies, you're pretty much guaranteed to lose the game. Worse, you have to pay your king off in order to go to war.
-When Indians like you so much (via a culture push) that they convert their cities to your cause, they destroy their city and all commit suicide. If that doesn't make any sense to you, you'd be right.
-There's exponential decreases on everything in the game - colleges train settlers slower and slower over time, churches recruit less and less people, taxes go up meaning you get less and less money, prices of cannons go up meaning you can afford less and less. It gets to the point where you say, ""What's the point of it all?""
-City defense is pretty much pointless. While there's all sorts of things to boost your defense percentage while in towns, the REF has units which get 150% to attack towns, meaning that all that stuff is useless, since they just slaughter you in a town. What's the point of waiting 50 rounds to train a guy to be a fisherman in a game with only 300 rounds overall?

This game will continue to be deeply flawed until Firaxis or some fans come out with a patch for it overhauling the mechanics. IMO, it needs the following:
Complete overhaul of the REF / Revolution mechanics.
A bit more detail on the military units. Maybe allow buying Man O' Wars, or building forts, or capturing cannons.
Have money actually mean something.
Economic, Military, and Loyalist victory paths.
Fix the rather stupid Constitution process - most of the choices have only one answer that players are interested in.

Every game of Rockstar is a sentimental trifle in acceptable, liberal political attitudes about Modern America. The overwhelming majority of little kids and teenagers are dramatically undereducated, and so the potential seriousness latent in the themes of course go unnoticed. What we get is reified caricatures of Western truisms previously communicated to us by older entertainment, framed by the typically woeful Rockstar scripts and action sequencing. It's just another GTA in Western garb.

As with GTA, auto-aim dominates all action, so the gameplay becomes very repetitive and boring, all of which is channeled through the X button, that little button you have to mash a million times to run or ride anywhere. Unlike Last of Us, gameplay sequencing has absolutely no direct relation to the narrative. The narrative itself is stitched together by the usual GTA array of anomalous 'fetch' missions, whose only purpose is to accelerate the peculiar hastiness typical of GTA games to its ultimate conclusion. Thus, everything depends on 'story,' and Rockstar is a developer that refuses to provide a coherent narrative but instead has long preferred vignettes of intellectual mediocrity posing as legitimate social commentary.","gets really boring, really fast",1405555200,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Basic Geometry, how Michael Bolton became successful.....and how a great and iconic character like Batman can never have a decent video game. The first Batgame for Playstation 2, Vengence, had it's moments. Though it wasn't ""great"" it at least felt like a Batman game. Batman Dark Tomorrow was an outright disaster. And now it looks like Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu continues the downward slide for the Dark Knight.
Rise of Sin Tzu's biggest downfall is it's gameplay. Where as Vengence attempted to be more of an adventure oriented game, Rise of Sin Tzu takes an entirely different approach. It's pretty much a straight forward beat 'em up game. But unfortunatley it doesn't know how to keep you interested in it to make you keep wanting to play. The game descends into punching and kicking your way past various non-descript bad guys and the occassional gas bomb lobbed in to the fray by the villain the Scarecrow. Two players can play in a co-operative mode simultaneously but it does little to change the gameplay. The game is interesting for about ten minutes then boredom quickley sets in. After the first few levels I could see that there was pretty much nothing else this game had to offer.
The graphics on this game are decent. Batman, Robin, Batgirl and Nightwing all move with convincing ease and fluidity. But the environments are rather plain and sterile. They look like they could be just about any street anywhere. There was nothing to indicate that this was Gotham City. It could have been Cleveland for I knew. The sound was also very generic. Sure Batman and company uttered some pretty good ""one liners"", but it got old fast.
The controls are very easy to manage. They are however wasted on a game like this. The time it will take you to become accustomed to the controls is maybe about five to ten minutes.
This game managed to let me down on just about every level. I'm not even sure if a hardcore Batfan would even enjoy it. Ubi Soft has shamelessly squandered the potential for this licence. At this point the only thing that I think would inject new life into the franchise is if the game license changed hands and went to a company like Activision, Electronic Arts, Eidos or anyone else.

What is an activation? Install the game, that's an activation. Change a piece of hardware, that uses an activation. Reinstall Windows without changing any hardware, that uses up an activation. You might even use up an activation upgrading a video or sound driver. Adding a USB peripheral device could use up an activation.

I think even GameCube. And to cover up their error they raised the price to cover the new parts and stuff installed into the XBox360s to prevent any reoccurring error.

1. You cannot beat the game without dying over and over and over again. This is one of those ""learn by dying"" games, where every time there's a new challenge, you die multiple times until you finally figure out how to beat the challenge. This ruins the immersion in the game.

2. You cannot complete a majority of the quests without looking online to find out how to complete them. Most of the quests have no map or guide to show you where to go, so unless you want to wander around aimlessly for hours and hours until you coincidentally happen to end up at the right place or talk to the right person, you're going to have to just look up online where to go/who to talk to.

Now the Bad?This game is a combinations of Sonic the Hedgehog and Conan the Barbarian on PS3 in a bad way. This game gives you one enemy to fight every 15 minutes (after running up walls (like sonic), upside down walls, over ramps and bridges for over 98% of the game.)The basis of this game makes me think greenpeace endorsed it b/c the Prince and his friend go from one cave to another to heal the land; this means watching the grass grow by pressing a button. The fighting is almost nonexistent since you don't fight at any time more than one enemy at a time; and when you do fight an enemy you just press one button over and over.

This game is also the perfect example of how greedy developers have become.

I was wrong.  Because the microphones are not actual USB mics and have to plug into a USB adaptor, Karaoke Revolution games do not detect these ""SingStar"" mics.

Secondly, SingStar does not give you the option to remove the lead vocals from the songs.  This defeats the whole purpose of Karaoke.  Even on Karaoke mode, the lead vocals are still there.

Lastly, The game has a very small selection of songs, and there are a handful of tracks that are ""medleys"", which are basically a medley from choruses of the same songs that are already on this game.

Conclusion.

Forget about a story line. You start as some guy (I assume Marty?) running down the street. You have to dodge hoola-hooping women, charging beefcake men, and bees (or maybe humming birds). Just like in the movie, you can grab a bowling ball and shoot these obstacles before they hit you! Occasionally you'll have a chance to grab a skateboard, but that just makes you crash quicker. Can you make it to the end of the block before 200 seconds runs out?

The only thing in the game that kinda ties it to the movie is a picture of Marty, his brother and his sister on the bottom of the screen, which fades away as time passes. Of course, I only know this because I've seen the movie, and it really looks more like a picture of George Washington, Jack White and Nosferatu with a bad toupe (now that'd be a great game!). You have to grab alarm clocks to keep it from fading, which makes perfect sense.

Let's say you make it through the five or so levels like this, which are all pretty much the same... It'll get you to Lou's Cafe (hey, something from the movie!), but that's when it gets even weirder. ""Bullies to go!"" it says as Marty walks in. He grabs someone from behind the counter and slides her down to the end of the room. Then it says ""Boy, they sure threw you out in a hurry!"" and you have to replay the last street level. Once you beat it, this happens again! And each time, you lose a life until it's game over! Is it even possible to make it past this part of the game? After several attempts, I've concluded that no, it is not possible.

If you want to flash back to a time when video games made no sense and slapped any random movie title on a cartridge so that it'd sell, then this is the game for you! But if you're looking for anything that has to do with Back to the Future - music, characters, story, a DeLorean - then you've come to the wrong place.

""Being such a hard-core adventure game fanatic, if and when it finally does come out, I'll gladly play it.  Like the saying goes, 'there's no such thing as bad chocolate'.  But, at this point, I'm not holding my breath for some Godiva-like quality with this one.""
Well, the game did finally arrive and after playing it for a couple of hours last night, I can honestly say that this game is actually like the product ""Mocklate"" in the 'Friends' episode where Monica is hired to cheerfully promote the faux-product.  It looks just like chocolate, but it leaves a really BAD taste in your mouth!
My wife and I really love to play adventure games, it is the only game genre we play.  If you've seen some of our other game reviews, you will know this is true.  While the initial episode of Crystal Key was inexplicably a strong seller, the game itself was not exactly earth-shattering.  We've played a lot of adventure games and 'The Crystal Key' ranks well down on our list of favorites (but, by all means, not at the bottom).  It was just a good, solid, average adventure game.  When they announced a sequel, we figured that they probably learned from the competition, grown along with the technology of gaming, and created a new chapter of the story that matches or exceeds the original.
Boy, could that NOT be further from the truth.  This game is truly awful!  With the delays and price-chopping factored in, we had set our expectations exceedingly low.  But, some how, they managed to sink even well below that level.  The pre-released screen shots and trailer for the game cannot prepare you for how bad the actual gameplay really is.  Here are just a few of the CONs to the game (there are no PROs):
-The graphics are even worse than the original game (which is almost five years old now).  Like the first game, they are pre-rendered, 360 degree panning shots that you are forced to navigate from point to point.  However, the textures and details of these graphics are far worse than in game one.  Every scene looks washed out and out of focus.  Plus, the cylindrical views actually ""jumped and popped"" as we turned which got exceedingly annoying after a while.
-The music soundtrack, I am not kidding, sounds like it was dubbed from a porno movie!  I think they meant to give the game a ""hipper"" beat but, oh my, I don't think they intended to make THAT association.
-The characters of the game are immovable, pixilated add-ins that show absolutely no emotion.  The voice-over acting is adequate, but the dialog is sophomoric at best.
This drivel looks like it was created by a twelve-year-old, indy game developer using an old 386 computer.

I have to reflect what pretty much everybody else said about this game, nicely put together, but the storyline is muddled (is the rest of the single player game on the cutting room floor somewhere?) and has gaps big enough to drive a c130 through it.

The execution of the game is great, the weapons are multiple and characters look great, but I was truly expecting more! I am a casual Single player FPS and I played the entire game in one session (less than 4 hours!).

Not realy worth the extra money, too bad.

One has the distinct feeling, that something is missing. Where is the rest of the game??

The other complaint is the requirement to install STEAM. That whole concept maybe ok for someone who has access to cable or other high speed service, but STEAM is ridiculously slow on satelite and I am not talking multi player mode either.

Just launching the game with the STEAM engine, takes almost 2 minutes and a lot of times it freezes and you have to re-launch.

So explain this to me, I bought the game, installed it on my PC but when I want to launch the game, STEAM has to contact its server first to assure it is realy mine???? Pathetic, STEAM sucks for any single player and dial-up or satelite modems.

1.0,True,"05 24, 2010",A2FTHCGH06O4Y5,B000BPBAPI,Caraculiambro,"It's a bit shameful that I would be giving this game a one-star review, since the bottom line is this:  I played it several hours a day for almost two months and got a ton of enjoyment out of it.  And it only cost me about twenty dollars!  How's that for value?  There were times I felt the game had been programmed by a twin version of myself who knew exactly the kind of game I would like.  The point is, this is great game and I really enjoyed almost all of it.  I knew I would write this review and for a long time wavered between giving it one star or five stars.  Unfortunately, I'm in a rotten mood just now, so one star it is!

The chief thing that eventually wound up getting my goat was the many interface issues.  True, the interface in many respects is much smoother than in similar games, but there was some room for improvement.  I compare this game not to similar titles such as ""Imperium Galactica II"" and ""Master of Orion"" but to itself:  what it could have been.  Seems like there's one major patch still to be issued, only there won't be:  the company is on to other things.  Admittedly, there was nothing that really rankled you the first week of playing, but if you play this game for weeks and weeks, there are some things that are really gonna get on your nerves:

1.  The research completed screen keeps popping up and there's no way to get it not to.  The writing here is so good that the first couple of times you're not going to have a problem, but if you're playing the game through dozens of times, that really grates.  Same thing goes for various announcements about mysterious force-fields, political developments on other planets, gossip from the other races, etc.  There should have been a way to not be bothered about this, the way you can choose not to be bothered by ""found anomaly"" pop-ups.  All this seriously detracts from the replayability of the game.

2.  There was no need for this game to be 3D (especially given #5 below).  It's essentially a 2D game -- yet incredibly consumptive of your computer's resources.  There should have been an option to just play in 2D, with those symbols for the ships and planets.  In fact, 3D just makes this game more confusing:  when you zoom in to a planet, for example, you can't readily apprehend its class.

3.  The money in this game is all messed up.  They don't give you enough at the beginning.  There's a million things you need to do at the beginning and since the computer never wastes a move, it's never enough.  Minimally, they should have given you more money on the easier levels.

4.  Some of the research was b.s.  Do you really need to be able to research alliances?  Good and evil?

5.  In battles you're reduced to nothing more than a spectator, be it land battles or space battles.  Major drawback to this game.  Checkout ""Imperium Galactica II"" for an example of how they might have factored in your generalship in land battles.

6.  Your ability to built fleets is pathetic.  You can only get about 8 serious ships together.  Why is this!  It's not like we're going to run out of room.  This is outer space!  You should have been able to mount fleets of hundreds.

7.  Pirates and minor races don't obey your guidance about difficulty levels.

8.  The screen keeps recentering on planets and ships without your being able to do anything about it.  When you're playing with a ""huge""- or ""gigantic""-sized galaxy, this can get really disorienting.

9.  You cannot pause the tutorials to write something down or look at something carefully:  you have to replay the whole thing.

10.  Although the game has many difficulty levels, there are not smooth gradations between them.  I did like how in ""Cakewalk"" your opponents are reduced to drooling idiots, useful if you're just learning what is inarguably a complicated game.  But as I got better, I noticed that in moving from ""Beginner"" to ""Normal"" there was a jarring jump.  Fortunately, in my experience, the computer opponents never break alliances with you treacherously, allowing you to plan out your overall grand strategy.  One thing I wish the game had done was have it so that you could slide the difficulty during the game:  I like to start out Easy so that I can at least get a footing and have the assurance that I'm not going to be wiped off the map in one fell swoop; then, once I've got my civilization up and running, go in for higher difficulty.  You can't do this.  If you choose ""Easy,"" the game is easy all the way to the bitter end.

11.  The campaign is a crock, I think.  I've never seen a walkthrough on the Internet, and it's difficult to get through, even if you choose ""Cakewalk.""  Two things I'm thinking of here:  First, most of the campaign settings can be got through by simply laying low and letting your allies do all the hard work.  This was a let-down, since to get through the level, you're reduced to playing an ancillary role, though you've got a right to expect to be front and center for any battles.  (The way to get through the grand battle, Apocalypse, for example, is to simply colonize the four planets closest to you, then tech trade like made so that your allies have as much technology as possible.  Then, they'll go in a take out the Dread Lords for you.  If you get it into your head to enter the fray yourself, the overwhelming military superiority of the Dread Lords is just crushing when you meet them.) Thus the campaign is doable, but incredibly unsatisfying.  In many of the missions, you're actually marshaling all your resources just to hold your own against your allies (Altarians, I'm thinking of you!) who have the gall to build influence bases right next to your core planets!  Whose side are they on?

12.  Although the ""Doc"" Smith-style story is a perfectly serviceable setup for the game, what actually happens at the end is a majorly unsatisfying downer.

13.  Many ""planetary improvements,"" if you actually sat down to do the math, turn out to be a crock (especially some of the banking ones).  I don't think any game should do this:  an improvement should be an improvement.

14.  Population growth is also a crock:  your planet can't have more than 20 million people, or you'll have approval problems.  This is something I had to learn from a message board:  the manual sure won't tell you.

15.  I don't know about you guys, but my TURN button is always stuck on SKIP and I have no idea what it's doing.  There should have been a way to turn that off.

16.  The game should have distinguished the races better.  When you played with a different race, it didn't really feel like it was a completely different game, like it did in Starcraft.  In fact, creating your own Custom Race was a bit of a dud since you can jigger any race's specs to be exactly what you want anyhow.

17.  It was way too easy to win with an influence victory.

18.  Autoexplore and autoinvestigate are buggy.  They say there's nothing to explore but there clearly is.  Plus if you build several ships and instruct them to do this, they don't go off in different directions:  they merely follow each other in a line!

Of course, I am open to reason!  Here's a brief list about what I thought was great about the game:

1.  There are a lot of cheat codes available if the game is too hard for you or if you are just learning.

2.  You can build and deploy your own custom ships.

3.  The writing (e.g., the notification of completed research, the diplomatic dispatches) is the most funny I've ever seen in video game.  Very well done.

4.  You truly can win using vastly different strategies.  This is something many similar games boast of but don't really deliver on.  This game does.

Me personally I hate being treated like a thief.
I spend good money for games and am even before I install the game am treated like a thief.
DRM is ok to a point but come on if your going to put it on a game spell it out on the package so the consumer can make an informed decision about it. The having a constant net connection was the killer for me.
If you live in an area that loses their net allot like a few of my friends do or if your like me and like to put it on a laptop and take it outside and play then your just SOL.

I wonder how many actual sales they lost over perceived losses to pirates?
The only person that DRM hurts is their paying customers. A pirate is not going to buy the game for what ever reason, so why punish the customers that put the meat and potato's on your table?

I think that some of it is that a company has a great game (so they think) and if it does not sell well then they blame it on the bad old pirates. When in fact it could be any number of things like, wrong price point, buggy game, bad promotion, etc....
I can make a pong game and say oh this should sell 10,000 units and then when it does not blame people pirating the game because I only sold 2 copies.

Wasn't the Ford Etsel like that. Ford spent all this money designing what they thought was the perfect car but it in the end was a bomb. Ummmm wonder if it was pirates that caused low sales of that too?
Sound to me to many software companies are counting their chickens before they hatch and when they don't get what they thought then blame on bad old pirates.

Pirates are the boogie man hiding in the closet for most software companies but if they turned on the lights they will see there not really there and as bad as they think. Most people I know that pirate games end up buying them and the expansion packs as well, maybe not for $60 but something is better then nothing in the end.

As I am writing this AC2 has just over 70 one star's so if we figure that at lease another 30 would had bought but didn't bother rating the game thats 100 people and if the game averages out to $50 per (I know now its more but the ones that pre-ordered got it for less), thats $5,000 in sales lost just because of the big bad boogie man and they felt they needed to put DRM in the game. So a loss of $5,000 (plus all the money they had to pay programmers for the DRM) just to stop a few people that wouldn't had bought the game anyways. Does not seem like a smart business decision to me. But hey what do I know I am just the customer UBISoft is trying to sell their product to.

If I was new to Ty games, maybe I would have liked it better, but there was something about the first game's laid back style that appealed to my family. You could explore that game. In this one, 2 seconds in you are battling a ton of bad guys. There's no into to the story.

Worse, the 2nd battle in has been unbeatable to us.

So why is it so bad? Well there is an unbelievable amount of hit detection issues. The kinds where you'll pump a guy point blank with 20 rounds (literally an entire clip in some instances)  and you can see blood splatter...but no hit markers, and no dead player. However two shots from them and you're dead. Yet the kill cam shows something far different than what you saw. And the camping....the levels are pretty damn big some of them,  and everyone just seems to camp. Especially snipers and shot gunners. Giving you no chance really. I have been playing first person shooters for years. Everything from Call of Duty, to Battlefield,  to Halo. And I have never done as bad as I have in this game. Ever. I have only had one...literally one match where I went positive. There's no regional match match making so I often get stuck with people who have very poor Internet. The result is I get 2 kills...and about 20 deaths on average simply due to hitmarkers not registering.  I even get delayed kills. When I shoot a guy full of lead, and get mowed down by him. Then soon as I Spawn the hitmarkers start randomly popping up on my screen along with points for a kill. Kind of like Battlefield 4 was at launch. On top of that, there is no option to search for specific maps to play on. I have played about 30 matches now. I have the season pass (really wish I didn't buy it cause I would get rid of this game if I hadn't but it's the last call of duty I will ever buy and it's really so me and my buddies can play) and I have yet to play anything.. ANYTHING outside of nuketown and 4 other maps. I always get popped into the same maps. On top of that, you can Spawn, promptly get killed,  Spawn again..AND GET KILLED BY THW SAME GUY AS SOON AS YOU SPAWN. But it doesn't end their. As if twice wasn't enough,  I have had it happen as many as four times in a row. You can Spawn right in the middle of the map just to get sniped as soon as you Spawn. I have even spawned in front of one of the enemy ground drones....I lasted less than four seconds.  And this happens in every...single...match. I have never gotten so mad at a game before.  Not even that I'm losing... Just that it's basically unplayable.  Now I wasn't sure if it was just me experiencing these things so I did some research..... There are forums FULL of these same complaints.  And no word from the developers on if or when they may be patched. Now my biggest issue isn't really any of what I previously explained. My biggest issue is not only does this game not work (zombies is terrific,  a lot of fun, and the offline modes are mostly error free except the A.I. Is horrible. You can run around a map with a full enemy A.I. team just to find them all standing in a corner.  That happens a lot. Fun fact though...the A.I. Won't just sit there.....they tbag. It's kind if funny sometimes)  but now you basically HAVE to play online of you want to unlock all the weapons which you get by spending crypto keys in the black market. To put this in perspective... I spent ten bucks on I think 1000 cod points, got all rare supply drops....all I got was taunts and paint schemes.... I have also spent about 90 hours playing this and I eventually unlocked a weapon...a crossbow.  Without these crypto keys that you can either play about... 15 matches to get thirty of them for a rare drop which is immensely time consuming,  and HOPE you get something (most don't and you do get duplicates of stuff. Each drop only unlocks three things at a time and many items you can only equip at certain ranks, making them pretty useless if you're a level 20 like me. Btw leveling up takes FOREVER.  It's painfully long.) or you can drop stupid amounts of money to buy them and often still end up with nothing you want. Some of these weapons are pretty damn powerful especially the shotgun. So it's essentially become a pay to win game. Or pay to access content already built into the game is a better description. You can't access the majority of this stuff offline by the way.  Those weapons that are supply drop locked you can not use offline without first buying them. Along with the all the melee weapons (aside from the starter knife) and most of the camos and character costume parts. Seriously just avoid this game. Please. I really wish I didn't buy it. It could be really really fun but it was just executed poorly and with maximum profits in mind instead of the fans and gamers themselves.  Keep in mind this is really the ONLY reliable franchise that Activision has right now so I suppose it was just a matter of time. If not for the pay to unlock system and how poorly the game functions online, this would be a great game. Not original,  not even a little,  but at least fun.

(This is going to be a rather long review, so I'll put a TL;DR verson at the base of it)

Single Player

The reason I was so psyched for Homefront was because of the premise of the Single Player campaign. The premise sounded incredible: 15 years in the future, Korea has unified, causing problems for the US. The US is abandoned by its cowardly allies and is eventually hit by a massive EMP and invaded and controlled by Korea. You are a pilot named Robert Jacobs fighting in the Resistance trying to make headway against the Koreans.

Sounds like a unique, slam-dunk plot, right? WRONG.

To start with, the single player is ridiculously short. If anybody tells you it is a 5 to 10 hour campaign, they are SORELY mistaken. The single player campaign contains 7 levels, each lasting a half hour at most. 3 hours later, just as you get into the game, it's over, just like that.

Now, a short game is fine if the story works... but it doesn't. As you play, you meet 4 other main characters, but you learn virtually nothing about any of the characters, yourself included. There is no clear motivation behind anybody in the game. This results in you realizing that you really don't care about any the plot in general. Then comes the factor that the plot line itself seems to jump around between levels with little explaination, and then abruptly ends with no resolution.

Controlls are similar to CoD in that the same buttons are used to reload, switch weapons, crouch, etc. However, the controlls  are much more sluggish than in CoD, which will quickly drive you nutty. And your AI teammates are just as slow as you are, which gets frustrating as you get stuck spending 5 minutes waiting for him or her to open a door or go up a ladder in front of you so you can continue on with your mission.

Graphics are strikingly low-quality. I saw comparable graphics last gen on my Gamecube. Now, I usually don't care about poor graphics if the gameplay and story are fun, but if they aren't, lousy graphics prove to be just another nail in the coffin.

Also, a side note: when you load up a new campaign in a shooter, you expect to be able to choose your campaign difficulty, especially when the game has multiple achievements related to completing levels on ""Guerilla"" difficulty. Halo does this, as does Call of Duty, Left 4 Dead, Gears of War, 007, and just about every other shooter I've ever played. Homefront, however, doesn't tell you what difficulty you're playing (normal by default). Instead, you have to actually seek out the difficulty settings below 3 levels of menus from the main menu. I didn't find this until I beat the game, and at that point I had absolutely no desire whatsoever to load up the game again.

Overall, the single player was probably the biggest letdown I have experienced in a very, VERY long time.

Multiplayer

After my very brief experience in single player, I continued on to multiplayer, hoping for a better experience. Needless to say, I was shocked by what I found.

Let me start off by saying I played a very small amount of the multiplayer. Some of the systems of the multiplayer did intrigue me, and I considered playing more, but I didn't. And here's why...

As it turns out, in an attempt to curb reselling of their crappy game, the developers included a single-use code for multiplayer access in the game. This means that, if you get the game used, borrow it from a friend, or rent it, you're screwed. You are allowed to play enough to get your character to level 5. You then have to BUY access for your profile to the game for 800 points. They are actually forcing you to buy access to content that 1) comes standard in most games, and 2) is something that we already pay for as Xbox LIVE Gold members. Also, over 300 of the retail 1000 gamerscore is multiplayer related, yet many people who pick up and play this game will immedialtey find that they can't get any of these achievements. You're essentially being forced to pay for a DLC pack just to be able to get the retail 1000 points.

TL;DR Version:

I can honestly say that, before Homefront, I had never played a game where it seems like the developers are actively saying ""SCREW YOU"" to the consumer, but Homefront said that and oh, so much more. The campaign does not deliver the gripping story promised but rather leaves you feeling bored and restless, and the multiplayer system gives the finger to anybody who borrows or rents the game.

1.0,True,"01 4, 2017",A3L79UTCHYNC0,B01G3WBCQY,Mako,"I am becoming convinced that none of the traditional gaming headset vendors can create a decent gaming headset. At least not one for XBOX One and have it be completely wireless (no chat cable).

After numerous issues with Turtle Beach's 800x, including an RMA, I have decided to try the ASTRO Gaming A50s now that these are completely wireless. I have read all these great reviews on them, but I have to tell you for $300 these do not feel like they should cost that much.

For one. They simply do not work without the USB cable plugged into the headset itself for power. I am guessing the power button simply does not work because moving the power button does not appear to make any difference to the operation of the headset. I can only power them up with a USB cable connected. I am very disappointed in the quality of these out of the box.

Once they have power, they sound nice enough. The controls take a little getting used to. You have to change the ratio of the voice chat volume to the game volume, and then you can adjust the volume as a whole. I am not sure yet if this is better than having two volume controls, one for chat and one for game volume.

I would also prefer a mute button. I do like that the mic mutes when moving it up, but also like the option of tapping a button. The other buttons take a little getting used to as they are pretty small and on the back of the right ear cup. It will take some getting used to where they are.

Finally the charge base seems a little temperamental. It appears to take a little finesse to place it properly to get it to charge.

If mine were not defective when opening the box, I would probably give these 4 stars, but receiving a broken unit gives me reason to believe the QA process that Astro uses is not very good. This makes me wonder what other issues may pop up.

UPDATE 2/5/2017
I have a replacement set from Astro and they power up and work OK. The mic was pretty mute when talking with my friends through XBOX live. I connected the setup to my PC and and the MIC volume was set to about 75-80%. I punched it to 100%. Now they think I am very loud. I moved the mic farther from my face to account, but will probably turn the mic down a little more in the PC application. Just sort of a pain to take it off my XBOX, move it to the PC and sync the new settings and then move it all back. Sort of trial and error. The headset sounds good enough, and it is relatively comfortable. I am really not liking the only mute option is to move the headset boom all the way (ALL THE WAY) up. If not, all the way, it does not mute. It makes noise when you handle the boom to mute it, which is counter to the point of muting. I am OK with muting with the movement of the mic boom, but it should mute sooner and not be ALL the way vertical. It really should have a quick tap button to mute though. Far more efficient. Also, still not pleased with the way it sits in the stand. Still pretty flaky, requiring a little fussing to get it charging.

If you do not need or desire 100% wireless on XBOX One, I would recommend another option. It will save you a ton of money and probably give you much better features to boot.

Update 2/27/2017
Operation has been fine for the last few weeks. It still takes some effort to get the headet seated into the base properly to charge it. A little surprised this is how Astro decided to design this headset and they were OK with the charging system. The lack of a proper mute button is really becoming irritating. I hate it when people are sneezing, coughing, or otherwise making unwanted noise into my ear. I do my best to mute my mic to mitigate that with everyone listing to me as well. Not having a proper mute button is really making this difficult. I cannot swing the mic boom all the way to the farthest upright position to engage the mute fast enough to catch a sneeze. I find it odd that this would also be the way they would design this. There is no reason you cannot have two mute options. One with moving the mic boom up, and it should activate at considerably less than 90 degrees, the other being simple tap-able button on the outside of the ear cup. My wired Logitech USB headset had this feature and love it. Use it for conference calls using Skype all the time.

What could have made this headset great, is a mute button and a better charging option that did not rely on a flaky seating of the headset in a base station. Seems there was some odd design choices here that really hold these headsets back and make me regret shelling out $300 for a supposedly premium experience.

Update 3/22/2017
Two major bugs with this headset
1) The base station seems to 'loose connection' with the console routinely. The best way to work around this is to unplug the USB and plug it back in. Sometimes switching to PC mode and back will fix it but not always. Some forums suggested this is some issue with the XBOX instant on feature, but I have found the headset base looses its connection to the Xbox regardless of the instant on being enabled.
2) The game chat does not work in all games. XBOX Party Chat works fine (as long as you unplug and replug the USB in) but games like Destiny also have game chat, and the headset will not broadcast voice. It does not even detect any noise being transmitted by my MIC, but I can hear others talk. This is also a serious issue. Not everyone uses Party Chat or has issues of their own with Party Chat. So having a headset that does not work in game chat is very limiting.

At this point, if I could return this headset I would. If this were a $50-90 dollar headset, I could kind of forgive all the issues and design flaws with this headset, but for $300, the experience should be exceptional and it is not.

UPDATE 9/15/2017: Firmware update and fixed the issue with requiring the USB to be unplugged and reconnected every so often for the XBOX to detect the headset, but now it is back and doing it more than ever. It actually takes multiple attempts to disconnect and reconnect the USB now. The issue with game chat not working is still a problem even in Destiny 2. I don't know if this is something specific to Destiny as I don't really play other online games that require or can benefit from voice chat.

Worst money I have ever spent, Well, now tied with the crap headset of the Turtle Beach Stealth 800x.

I HOPE that the new headset that Turtle Beach is releasing, which uses the native wireless protocol of an xbox controller, may be better, but never again will I buy a wireless gaming headset without trying it out first.

You get to play as your favorite Marvel character.

Cons:
Filled with bugs from the jump. I had to replay the first mission several times just to get the boss to spawn. Bugs that should have been fixed with ease have yet to be and it's very disappointing.

The vehicle controls are absolute garbage, Makes what should be an enjoyable experience a nightmare. The combat system is also a disappointment, It's very shallow.

Repetitive and boring missions such as placing a piece of furniture 100 times. Makes the game very tedious and proves how little effort they actually put into it. If you want any real campaign, You'll have to shell out another 35 dollars for one of the play sets. Even then it's not much value to it.

Let me explain: the game itself is amazingly designed, although a pretty linear type of RPG. You can read any review on what makes this a good game and those reviews are probably spot on. Here's why I'm giving it a 1-star, though.
For a game that lets you make choices, there are a few important places where the choices are so limited that you have to make a choice that you'd never make in real life, or given more options.
But even worse, at some point, giving the answer that you might think is the right one (the honest answer) will get your game to come to an abrupt end. A complete game over. Meaning, you'll have to go back, and figure out which answer the developers want you to give. In short, you don't get to give the answers that YOU would want to give.

As much as it sucks to not have a physical copy and it sucks, if you absolutely must play the games buy the digital versions for the reasonable price.

Edit:
I think it's fair to 1 star this product because because the game included in other ""special editions"" is exactly the same as the game included in the standard edition.  The standard edition of the product holds the rest of the game hostage as dlc, albeit for the same price.  But everyone railing against the 1 star reviews would in all honesty rather have the physical copies than the dlc.

Also most companies gauge interest in their ""special edition"" to decide how many print up so they're maximizing their profit.  Nintendo likes making collectibles because it creates scarcity and makes a product look more desired than it is.  It doesn't make Nintendo any money and frankly they under-priced it.  I'm okay with collectibles but it's a mistake for the cart in the ""special edition"" to be a collectible, basically this is Nintendo token backtracking and admitting it was mistake to split it into 2/3 games.  I know it's not a perfect analogue but they never created a Pokemon ""special edition"" side by side with the original release of the split games, those always came later and they weren't limited print ""special editions"".  If I was investor, I'd be angry with how much in additional profits they failed to capitalize on this.

If an owner of the ""special edition"" can honestly tell me they'd be happy not owning this version of game, so it can be a collectible for others, or think it's worth the current scalper price (because it isn't $80 anymore), then that needs to be in your 5 star reviews.

Not only does it attempt to throw mud on everything that was great and original about FFX, but the scariest part is it almost succeeds!

For those who seem to love this game (preteens and anime geeks, I imagine), let's break it down the same way you all did, only this is strictly for those who like QUALITY game play, QUALITY characters, and above all, NO JAPANESE POP SONGS OR POP PRINCESSES!

Plot: Like being trapped in the worst anime and having to play as the characters in one excruciating scenario after another. Yuna, Rikku (most annoying character from the previous game makes a new appearance! Yay!), and emo girl Paine are now singing sensations in Spira! Nefarious villains seem to dislike your newfound pop success, and in a pointless quest for mundane spheres, cackle and plot in such over-dramatic form it would make the Wicked Witch of the West melt in embarrassment.

Characters: The aforementioned Yuna and Rikku have all their most annoying traits laid bare in this game. While you could forgive the sometimes weak dialog and annoying vocal talents of them in FFX, they don't have such sweet characters as Auron or Lulu to balance them. Emo girl Paine is hardly a good enough replacement. ""Oh, I'm sulky and beautiful and the world doesn't understand me. I'm going to funnel my angst into my songs.""

Gameplay: The biggest difference between FFX and its sequel is the reintroduction of classes, a much-beloved ability that allows characters to assume the roles of mages, gunslingers, swordsmen, and other useful roles. Not so in this game. You switch between them in battle, meaning you don't stick with one class for longer than a few monsters, meaning you never associate any character with any one class, meaning they become frivolous fast. And who the hell wants to be a ""singer"" in the middle of a battle? Oh, right, preteens and anime geeks.

Music: *gag*

Overall: The darkest hour in Final Fantasy history was when this game was released. It's a discredit to other games such as the masterful FFVIII that are given the same rating on Amazon as this one.

Which is to say that sound tactics count for nothing and spamming buttons as fast as possible* counts for everything. If you do not like RTS games in the Command & Conquer style you simply will not enjoy this game.

As with most RTS games the basic problem is that the individual units have no intelligence at all, they all have to be micro-managed. With hundreds of units to manage this very rapidly devolves into a mad frenzy of mouse click simply to get your units to engage a reasonable target. Furthermore it's not possible to set a path for a unit to follow. If you want your recon unit to take a position on the flank and set it to 'move fast' it will attempt to drive through the enemy front line to get there.

On top of that the game provides no guidance whatsoever. There's no explanation, for example, of how units resupply. The tutorial says 'Use your FOB to resupply your tanks', but doesn't say that you have to move the tank close to the FOB and it re-supplies automatically.

Bottom line: if you were looking for a wargame that involves tactical decision making and planning, this is not it.

I agree with the other reviewers who say this was a big disappointment. The people who developed this game have not heard of something called a mouse. The game is 1st person 3D, but you have to move with the keyboard--and not even with the arrow keys, with A, S, D and W. Trying to move through the scenes was an exercise in frustration--I was constantly running around in circles, bumping into walls, and sometimes ending up in random places as if I fell through the floor. According to a walk-through I consulted, I had made it about half-way through the game before I gave up and decided to move on to something less painful. Another thing is that the graphics demands for such a simplistic game are insane. Unless you have a fairly new computer, you will have problems with the graphics in this game. I have a 128MB video card, and while the game was playable, the graphics were constantly freaking out and the panning was unbearably sluggish.

UNDISPUTED FACT:
BIOSHOCK will only install for a limited number of times (it was 3 but - after a deluge of eMails and bad reviews - it was upped to 5). So, if you install it you will be reluctant to uninstall once finished and will have to carry those 9GB on your HardDrive for a long time. On top of that, its resale value is down the drain the moment one pops the box open...
Even after the patch that removed the activation limit, uninstalling still leaves behind certain irremovable folders that will make sure it can be re-established in the future.
So one has to ask: even after paying $50 for it, WHO ACTUALLY OWNS MY COPY?

UNDISPUTED FACT:
The game utilizes an overzealous version of SecuROM 7+. They either activated all its available options or had a special version custom made. No other game company dared behaving in such heavy-handed way. This means that if your computer has more than one disc drive (or even one but non-DRM certified) it may block them, whereas the game may not even install if you are running virtual drives or have certain media-burning software installed (even NERO has been known to be considered ...""pirate-ware""!)

DISPUTED FACT :
It has been widely reported that BIOSHOCK installs a RootKit. Both MICROSOFT's ROOTKIT DETECTION TOOL and AVG ANTI-VIRUS detected either the RootKit or its actions. Recently, AVG was made to release a special update (just for BIOSHOCK) to ignore this alert.
In hacker lingo, to ""take someone's Root"" means to insert a procedure that ""will allow the intruders to maintain root access (highest privilege) on the system without the system administrator even seeing them"".
Official BIOSHOCK announcements (and their ""unofficial"" reviewers here at AMAZON) will try to persuade everyone who would listen that there is nothing there, so stop looking and don't even mention it.
Understandable reaction since, the existence of a RootKit would be a solid basis for class-action litigation.
Weight the facts and judge for yourself.

UNDISPUTED FACT:
BIOSHOCK effectively revokes our Administrator rights on our own computers. Here is what happens: even after completely uninstalling the game there is a mystery folder that canNOT be removed, no matter what!
On WinXP it is located here:
""C:\Documents and Settings\[User Name]\Application Data\SecuRom""
As administrators, we could (unwisely) delete even Windows System folders - yet BIOSHOCK's mystery folder apparently claims a higher authority level? What this folder does and why should it get placed into OUR computers so that we cannot remove it even as Administrators, is beyond me. And I, for one, do NOT appreciate it one bit. (A quick internet search revealed a number of suggestions on how to get rid of it, ranging from clearly unsafe to catastrophic...)
True, almost every game leaves one or two folders behind after uninstalled - but this NEVER REVOKES OUR ADMINISTRATOR RIGHTS to delete them!

I do understand that there are production and publishing costs to get recovered as well as profit projections to be reached. Companies that wish to protect their investment will always try to fight piracy. This is only reasonable and expected.
However, with BIOSHOCK, as it is currently available by 2K GAMES, it gets WAY OUT OF HAND & WELL BEYOND RIDICULOUS!!

No one in the game-publishing industry seems to learn from past mistakes: every security system eventually gets cracked and every ""OnLine activation requirement"" eventually gets bypassed. So, utilizing an overly intrusive, inconvenient and possibly dangerous security kit only serves in penalizing the people who actually paid good money for their product - and manage to shoot their sales in the foot at the same time.
Look what happened with HALF-LIFE 2: legitimate buyers still have to put up with activating the game every time we want to play - and of course VALVE paid the price: unprotected HL1 had sold TWICE as many units as STEAM-""secured"" HL2 ever did (8million and 4million respectively, Source: THE WASHINGHTON POST)

Since I would NEVER install a contraption such as BIOSHOCK onto my computer and wished to have hands-on experience before I reviewed the game, I asked around and a colleague of mine had already made the mistake of purchasing it and installing on his laptop.
THIS IS NOT A BAD GAME.
The environments are well designed and have a pleasant retro patina; the graphics are very nice, even though they do not meet the hype. They are comparble to older games such as HL2 (not to mention STALKER).
You see, dark is not always moody, and blurry cannot always be mistaken for dreamy.
I did love the music though! Both the collection of happy-go-lucky and Big-Band romantic 1940's songs (contrasting with the bleak environment) as well as their smart timing, added to the overall experience.

It was the gameplay I was the least impressed.
Totally linear - as it is has come to be expected from any FPS today I am afraid. To be fair, I cannot imagine a Single Player holding a storyline without being more or less linear (even ""free""-roaming FAR CRY did not escape this curse) - but then again, that is why I am not a game designer. And unless the publishers release their creative suffocation of the true game artists, there is no hope for a worthy successor to SYSTEM SHOCK 2.

The controls are not hard to get used to; if not, they are completely remapable; nevertheless, I would love to have an real inventory: cycling between which plasmid and which ammo for which gun can get pretty frustrating. Fast.
Not that hitting your enemies does any good. For a game that is based on an alternative reality scenario and counts in immersing you into that world, the damage dealt by the guns is pretty unrealistic. A double-barreled full blast with the (augmented!) shotgun in the head of a generic splicer will NOT take him down.
And what's with the scarce ammo!? I ended up using the 1-2 combo (electric plasmid shock followed by quick ...wrench hits) one picks up in the first 10 minutes of the game throughout because the ammo was either of the wrong type or too expensive or nowhere to be found. Only at the very end was there an abundance of both money and ammo but by then they were pretty useless: a fully charged electric plasma gun and some propelled grenades is all one needs.

And, finally: dying. Regeneration chambers turn the game into a check-point one - and I hate checkpoint-games. Most often than not, they are chosen in order to artificially augment the gameplay duration (having us replay the same segments over and over - instead of saving wherever we feel like it). Moreover, when progressing, you usually end up getting killed just before the next regeneration chamber (and having to repeat quite a distance from the previous one) whereas, when facing a Boss, regeneration takes away all the suspense. Keep respawning, you will eventually get him, his health does not increase if you do.

So, all in all, BIOSHOCK is a good game BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO BE WORTH ITS EXCESSIVE DRM TROUBLE.
It is only a slightly above-average game; and if 2K GAMES did not have the guts to publish it for PCs (and is hiding it within an intrusive security Kit) it should have stuck with Xbox.

Even BIOSHOCK designers acknowledge there is a serious issue with the security measures forced upon them by the publisher. These measures are hurting their game and, so, THERE IS AN UPDATED VERSION COMING IN THE NEAR FUTURE TO FIX THIS!
Don't take my word for it. Google for ""Ken Levin-Interview"" and ""BIOSHOCK-Fixed-Version"" and see for yourself. (I tried to add links but Amazon, apparently, does not allow them)

BIOSHOCK has it all: SecuROM 7, temperamental and Limited number of Installations, overzealous Drive-Blockers, possible cloaked RootKits, irremovable folders...NONE of which is Clearly marked on the product description!!

As it is, it will come NOWHERE NEAR MY SYSTEM!

I would advise waiting for 6 months, they will either clear it up or it will find its way to the clearance bins...Just last week I bought RISE & FALL: CIVILIZATIONS AT WAR for $2.99 (less than 8 months after its release) - and that nugget featured STARFORCE of all things!

By now there are over...130(!) Comments on this Review (pages 1-2 & 9-10 are especially...informative). Over these weeks, there have been numerous attempts to suppress my review with either negative votes (that appear overnight in bursts - over...140 in the last three days alone!) or overly insulting comments - with my replies to them ""mysteriously"" receiving enough negative feedback to get folded as ""not helpful"" within minutes. The same happened as well to supportive comments posted by other customers.
When this was not enough, a ""shady character"" (who constantly changes her nickname) managed to become enough of a nuisance to have AMAZON REMOVE this review...TWICE(!).
Amazon decided to split the baby in half: it restored but kept from the first page no matter the customers' feedback. Not until the introduction of the Amazon's New Rating system was this review fully restored.

Even after the partial restoration of this Review, AMAZON's voting system is still getting abused in order to hide as ""not helpful"" comments posted by anyone else even remotely mentioning the serious issues of this game.

1.0,False,"05 4, 2015",A3GPR3LKLWHSXS,B00M9TD70K,VakarianGirl,"This game is pure junk, more or less.  I mean, is it an Assassin's Creed game?  Ye-es.  Yes it is.  But, in terms of effort by the developers and originality of gameplay - this game is just downright shoddy.

If you have played Black Flag (ACIV) then you have played this game.  This game is basically leftovers from Black Flag, regurgitated for a last final farewell on the last-gen systems, and it feels like it.  The premise is OK, in general - you play as a disillusioned Assassin who then joins the ranks of the Templars through a twist of fate......that's all well and good.  Story rarely makes Assassin's Creed games, or breaks them....

What DOES make or break Assassin's Creed games is gameplay mechanics and the flow of things - and Rogue is truly awful in these terms.  These games are all about parkour and free-running skills, and Rogue feels like it has been put together by a group of people whose finesse stops at judging how close to pull up at the McDonald's drive-thru.  Climbing up anything is hit-or-miss, except in the wild where you are dealing with cliffs, in which case it's 98% miss.  You will attempt to parkour up a cliff only to find that you simply fall back down to the ground after splatting up against an invisible wall.  If, on the rare occasion you actually do manage to latch on to the ledge of whatever you are trying to climb, you will spend five minutes shuffling back and forth with your hands as your guy dangles there before you actually manage to persuade the game mechanics that you are actually at a pixel where it will let you pull-up from.

You get stuck in boards and trees, too - when simply trying to free run, you will find yourself with your leg awkwardly glitched into a board from a shipwreck and unable to proceed.  Sometimes, your guy decides that he is an invalid and literally stops dead at small pieces of rock in the wild.  Juddering him free truly takes you out of your stride, and out of the game.

Every single viewpoint in the wild is the same.  The same freaking tree - every time, with the same kinks in the trunk and same 'rail' to run along to synchronize the viewpoint.  C'mon Ubisoft - are you even trying here?  And don't even get me started on the ""lurkers"" or whatever they are - in the cities and camps etc......suddenly you'll hear a bunch of whispery voices (think Parceltongue from Harry Potter), and the edges of your screen will go misty and foggy.....because.......lurkers, apparently.  Whuuuuut??  Who are these freaks, and why do they spend an entire day hiding in a haybale waiting for me to stomp by?  And......why do they speak the language of the House of Slytherin??

The sailing/ship battles/ship upgrading aspect of the game is....fine.  As usual, as has been displayed in both Black Flag and ACIII before it - Ubisoft have a rock solid naval battle system going on.  But, really.......this game offers nothing new with respect to the ship battles or exploration.....and so it becomes nothing more than Black Flag outcuts.

I usually enjoy Assassins Creed games - but this one left a sour note.  The weakest game in the series is ACIII, in my opinion, but this one comes a close second - basically because it is ACIII (climb the irritating trees.....all the trees) with a more extensive naval aspect.  The protagonist is actually also almost as irritating as Connor from ACIII, too......and that's saying something.

My kids liked the Version 1 release (it's just called Pet Vet), but they disliked this Version 2 release (called Pet Vet 2: Healing Hands).  Why?  Because the mouse action was terribly slow and delayed, unlike any other game I've seen.  It's not the hardware -- they're running on a fast 2.6Ghz Pentium 4 laptop with 512MB RAM and plenty of disk space.  No other game is slow like this one, and by slow, I mean the mouse action is slow and terribly unresponsive.

Because the mouse response was so poor, my kids really didn't like the game, so we're not going to buy it.  My advice is simple:  try the preview version by downloading from the the Internet (not from the Valusoft website -- strangely, they don't offer the download for Version 2, just Version 1), and if you like, then pull the trigger and buy the game (from Amazon -- it's cheaper than from ValuSoft directly).

My main complaint is the graphics -- they are still using MW 1 and MW 2 quality graphics. Compared to GoW 3, Battlefield 3, Rage, etc., etc., (and even older games like Crysis 2), MW3 sucks by comparison. Not even close. It's like the difference between an HD football game and a 360p football game -- it's really, really noticeable. I should note that the single player graphics are better than the multiplayer textures, however, which is the opposite of Battlefield 3.

They did add in some new game modes and stuff that are nice, and the single player campaign is still quite fun (even with the sub-par graphics), but I can't believe this game is projected to sell 17 million copies in the first week. This game will do well, but eventually their momentum will slow with this kind of sub-par performance. It's like they aren't even trying because they don't have to. Think: IBM in the 80s. It can, and will fizzle unless they get their act together -- Activision's Call of Duty is NOT too big to fail.

Multiplayer is different from Battlefield 3, which emphasizes massive, well, battlefields, with lots of heavy tanks stuff. Fairly different gaming experience. The two are not directly comparable. But if you like the up and close combat of Modern Warfare I think Gears of War 3 is vastly superior.

Bottom line: spend your money on Battlefield 3 or Gears of War 3 -- game franchises that are still innovating. They offer a somewhat different experience, but it is a much better experience. I would buy this for $30, but not $60. By the time you add in DLC like map packs and stuff, much less the Elite service, they are asking $100+ for it.

They have no idea how bad this game gets when you try to play it at a higher level aka play premades or organized teams.

Here are the negatives

There are hardly any games going. At any given time you're lucky to see 10 games looking for people and over half of them are european. On most nights you'll see only 4-5 games looking.

Pathing. The pathing is crap. You try to walk to the base and you get stuck randomly and you don't notice and you die because someone caught up to you because you were mentally autopiloting.  You're minions will just get stuck at the citadel or go the longest way possible.

Autoattack. The autoattack is terrible If you are attacking a guy then use an ability you will just start randomly attacking whoever is closest! It's ridiculously dumb!  So if you go for a quick heal or turn ooze off when you're chasing someone you will literally not be able to catch them because your character can and will turn around the other way!

Balance. There isn't much balance. It's similar to WoW Arena. The same comps roll in 2s, 3s,4s and 5s. There's little room for diversity. Most matches are over before they start

Inability to come back from a slow start.  If you have a marginal player on your team you're screwed. You can't carry them through it with skill. Once a team has 3 deaths its about 90% to lose and 5 deaths is about 95% to lose.

Mana regen.  In general early on you're always out of mana until you get items. This makes the game sort of zzz for the first few minutes

After attempting to play the game ( I have not finished due to it being awful and boring) I cannot figure out if it was to cash in on the movie Out of The Shadows or if it just simply exists or both. The game, excuse me I just threw up a little in my mouth, it has comic book style renderings not just for the cut scenes but the game itself. It attempts badly to let you parkour; you know, running up buildings and riding power lines and such but for no reason other than just to do it. There are no objects to smash or break or interact with. any weapon you buy has to be used on that level. The enemies are all about the same type various members of the foot clan. You supposedly can toggle during the game among which Turtle you want to be but I found this impossible in fact it is hard to keep track of your bros as they run off without you and you see their names off in the distance projected into the sky just so you know where they are at. The scenery is one note and the game is just god awful. I don't have anything more to say about that other than that I did pay full price and should have known better. Bad me. *Edit* You are able to hasten this games ""progress"" by commanding your AI turtles to go all out. This is especially convenient during boss fights which are the most difficult part of the game and would test the patience of Ghandi.

GRAPHICS/AUDIO
One of the many problems with this game that other people had was the system requirements; the minimum video card is NVIDIA GeForce 7600, which is not all together unheard of these days. So after 2 whole days of play, I have to ask ""Why?"" They don't seem to have done anything with all that graphics power. I've seen higher quality graphics on the old school Apple... Not the computer... the fruit. For a game that praises graphics as one of its' high points it is really, really cra... not good. Its to cartoon-ish & not in that ""retro"" kind of way, but in that ""we are too lazy to properly render backgrounds, so lets use the same texture map for every single surface"" kind of way"".

The music is also a problem. I'm not saying its bad, but combine the music, with the sounds of powers & attacks (mine, yours, his & the bad guys), combined with the really bad voiceovers & something has to give. I ended up turning off the music completely, just so I could hear myself think. Same goes for animations, its just to busy. You end up with a huge head ache from the sensory overload. Not to mention the annoying extra animations that signify targeting, or different sort of effects you can attempt to avoid. Right along side incoming damage/healing numbers, NPC speech bubbles & system information from pretty much everyone on your screen at any point in time. Its just to much & there seems to be no way to turn it off.

As a side note, I am going to give any game designers out there a free tip: NEVER EVER, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE USE THE COMIC BOOK SAN FONT! It is childish & hasn't been used in comics since the 1970's, it is not RETRO!

I will also mention now that the HUD is truly disgusting & I hope whoever designed it got paid a lot of money to make it, because with any luck it will be his last job in computer games ever. Its all so badly designed, that it makes City of Heroes HUD look like the work of an artistic genius. The maps are blocky & poorly designed, which would only be a problem if not for the fact that the entire map is obscured by superfluous data that cannot be filtered out.

1.0,False,"05 15, 2011",AA78TCLHXPJOK,B0001VNNE8,Tim B.,"A few years ago, when I had just recently gotten a PS2, I was super pumped when I got this controller. It was getting great reviews, I found it to be more comfortable than the official Sony controllers, and mine was working flawlessly-- for a few months. The rubber contacts on the buttons are made out of some ridiculously cheap rubber that even the Chinese knockoff makers would probably laugh at, and it was not long before my X button started sticking when it was depressed. For fighting games like Soul Calibur 2 and Mortal Kombat Deception, you NEED lightning fast response from the buttons. One sticky button completely ruins this controller, and eventually all of them will wear out due to the terrible material Logitech uses.

I actually considered picking up a Logitech wireless PS3 controller at one point since it uses the same form factor, and hoping that Logitech finally learned their lesson about the crappy material, I figured it would be easy to swap out the rubber contacts from the PS3 controller to restore my PS2 controller better-than-new. However, I learned ahead of time that Logitech uses the same crappy material in the PS3 controllers, and the buttons wear out just as quickly! I will probably never buy a Logitech controller again. My official PS2 controllers still work just fine after many years of making Jak and Daxter jump platforms and doing kombos and fatalities in Mortal Kombat, and that durability is worth putting up with wires for. Logitech's terrible neglect for quality materials ruined what would have otherwise been the ultimate controller for PS2 owners.

*UPDATE*

Recently I decided to take a stab at replacing the rubber contacts on the controller for old times's sake, and now there is a new problem: the piece of junk doesn't even sync up with the receiver anymore. I have tried every single ""solution"" suggested by Logitech on their forums, and when none of them work the mods are always extremely evasive and simply start ignoring the people who are having the sync problem. Maybe not everyone is as unlucky as me as with these controllers, but I can say with confidence that a great many of them were sadly not built to last. There is no way to repair a faulty wireless transmitter as far as I can tell, so now I have a wireless controller with perfect buttons that doesn't do anything except sit their and look pretty. Logitech really dropped the ball with this controller and I feel like the terrible experience I had has soiled my opinion of their gaming products in general. Perfectly crafted ergonomics doesn't count for anything when the device simply does not work, and even my ugly Pelican wireless controller that has inferior ergonomics to the official PS2 controller still works like new, while the Logitech one has become a pretty looking brick that I have sunk too many hours into trying to rescue.

Logitech only had the official Playstation license for these controllers during their initial run, and then Sony revoked their licensing agreement, causing Logitech to release their final batch under generic branding with no Playstation symbols on it. Now we know why. Sony makes products that last for years, and Logitech's quality control and customer service did not meet the standards needed for an official Playstation product.","Promising controller, terrible quality control!",1305417600,,,

In many ways Diablo 3 reminds me of some disappointments I had with Dungeon Siege 3.  There's the system that awards a player with every skill by the time a certain level is attained.  Gone are the days where you had a stable of characters each with their own specialization.  There's the system that automatically assigns stat points, another aspect that will be the same every time you play the game.  The only way to modify stat points is via item attributes.  Levels that are tight corridors.  While still fun in their own way all of these things detracted from the replay value of Dungeon Siege 3.  It was a play it a few times game and then forget it because you already knew which skills you'd end up with and what stats you'd have before you even started your second playthrough.  The exact same ones you had the last time.  Diablo 3 suffers the same fate, it's not going to last 12 years like its predecessor because there is no depth in character uniqueness.

The game is also shorter.  Sure, you can play it over again at a higher difficulty but it's still disappointing to have to play the exact same levels three times over to arrive at a decent target time for what should have been the time it takes to play through the game once.

With the online requirement that perpetually threatens playing time (and restricts play on my terms) and a severely shortened replay value I found it difficult to justify the initial price tag.  For what it is this game should have been much, much cheaper at launch.  I would say wait for a price drop but this is Blizzard.  You'll be waiting a long time for that.

1.0,False,"05 20, 2012",AFLRU6952DEFX,B00178630A,S.,"I've sat through an hour and a half of Diablo III, and honestly, it was boring.

Maybe I'm a bit cynical, but I kind of saw all of this coming, from the first point hearing about the healing orbs (aka power ups) to the DRM fiasco.  Most if not all the original makers of the Diablo franchise left Blizzard years ago for other companies (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Torchlight/dp/B001B5U80K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Torchlight</a>/ Torchlight 2), leaving a crew that's basically made WoW.  Unfortunately for them, that ship, WoW, has pretty much run its course.  With regards to D3, the criticism is not really a case of ""this isn't Diablo [II] enough"" but rather, this is all the bad sides of D2, with none of the good aspects (namely character customization and sort of a sandboxey go-where you like when you like feeling.  D3 100% linear guided tour, no choices, game on rails.).

Take D2.  You had to grind through 2 difficulties before you got to the ""real"" difficulty level where all the good stuff dropped and the tough battles ensued.  Doing those quests for a the millionth time really sucked but hey, that's what you had to do.  And you decided which quests you wanted to do, and sometimes in what order, and could go pretty much wherever you wanted whenever you wanted as long as you killed the act bosses.  Only this time, in D3, you have to grind through 3 difficulties before you get to the final one.  At least this time they shortened the time it takes, but in a way that's a negative as well just because there is hardly 60 bucks worth of content.  In D2 the loot made things interesting, but in D3 the loot is super randomized and always improving but doesn't feel special.

Think about it... would you rather play 60 hours of content on one difficulty level, or play 15 hours of content, four times repeated?  The second option sounds boring, and maybe in my misspent youth I would have gone for it, but now I think gamers know better.  Skyrim is looking like A LOT better value right now and at least is a real role-playing game. A roleplaying game is one where you take a risk, you invest in certain skills and skip others, and your character is a unique creation; you might have picked a good combo, or maybe not, but it was still your choice, your experiment.  In Diablo III, it's a socialist dystopia where everyone is perfectly equal and perfectly the same and perfectly boring.  If you want a character progression and choice over your path, don't just walk, run away from this title.

Diablo III is a game inspired by RPGs, even the interface and town interiors look ripped from Baldur's Gate.  But the game itself really has more in common with Contra or Metal Slug, 2d shooter style games where you run around, shoot the baddies, get the power-up, etc etc.  The rune system later in the game makes this a little more complex, but is sorta like Contra where you earned different ways of shooting - everyone has access to the exact same runes (skill tweaks) at any time, and you can change them at the drop of a hat.  Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

Diablo III looks like a mishmash of Warcraft III, World of Warcraft, and Diablo.  It can't quite decide whether it wants to be scary or cute and colorful, so it does both. The monsters and scorched ground areas look ripped from the undead campaigns in Warcraft III.  Honestly, if someone had told me this was some sort of super mod for that game, I might have believed them, as the game looks more like I'd expect a Warcraft game than Diablo.  The Grotesque monsters, for example, are supposed to be nasty things that scratch and claw and then blow themselves up into a bloody mess.  But instead they look like Kirby from the Nintendo games or mini versions of the Stay Puffed Marshmellow Man from Ghostbusters.  Seriously, the monsters are for the most part just WoWish and don't look like they belong in a traditional fantasy universe (like Dungeons and Dragons).

In the end, I can't believe it took them so long to develop what is essentially maybe 15-20 hours of content, strung along through repeated difficulties.  I'm sure someone will play this for hundreds of hours trying to get a marginally different styled armor for their cookie cutter character (since now there are really only as many character builds as there are character types).

You can take Blizzard's side and say that ""streamlining"" the game was good, but in reality, every character is exactly the same looking and acting, minus whatever differences in gear happen.  All female wizards for example look EXACTLY alike and have no customization of skills, appearance, face, hair, etc., etc, and if you've seen one, you've seen them all.  This was acceptable in 2000, not in 2005 and certainly not now.  Neverwinter Nights, Guild Wars, and Elder Scrolls games all always offered more depth of who your character was. No replayability.

I guess we can face it that this is an action game with customizable armor, but where apparently the physical damage of a held weapon determines your ability to shoot fire and lighting from your palms.  I'm sure someone will say that makes choosing a weapon easier, but it just makes the game make no sense, unless you look at it from the perspective of the developers not having the time or creativity to actually develop a convincing attack bonus system for casters.

In a way, the makers are lucky that people are locked out of the game.  Everyone wanted more from D3 than they remembered from D2, and I think most people got much less than they were hoping for.  Bad voice acting, bad storyline, and neat but ultimately forgettable cinematics (probably the cause of all the delay -- Blizzard having to pay for and film the equivalent of a movie within a game).  A game that can't really decide if it's a single player game or an MMO, so it tries to do both and doesn't truly suceed.  This is MMO-light, probably for people who sadly don't have the experience to know what this game is missing.

If this wasn't rentware, I'd give it 2 stars for at least having town interiors that reminded me of classic Bioware games. I haven't said much about the DRM and heavy server lag because everyone already knows the game is going to be somewhat crippled for a little while longer until either more people quit or Blizzard improves capacity.  I think it will be a fun game a year or two from now when it is patched and everything is rethought and the price is cut.  It is simply unplayable (lag, disconnects, 40 minutes of lost progress) at random times, and that's why my review is 1 star instead of 2 stars.

Until then, save your money, and buy something else.  D3 just isn't in the same league as the other games mentioned, and it just isn't worth paying that much for a temporary game that will be unplayable the day Blizzard decides to pull the plug on their servers, which could be tomorrow or could be 10 years from now (the mighty can fall - just look at the banks and GM).

In the end, you aren't paying for a game, you're paying for a subscription to their (laggy) servers, a MMORPG without the RPG and without the MM.

Client Stability and Server Availability
In general, the game engine is about as sophisticated as many three to four year old games - regarding graphics, audio, and general complexity. So, it runs very well even on older hardware.

The servers are brought down fairly regularly. I didn't play every day, but it seems as though the servers were down every day, sometimes for several hours, sometimes just for one.

Audio/Visual
This game looks and feels three or fours years old. It's prosaic and unremarkable in this department. Really nothing worth mentioning.

Game Play
Eve Online can be summarized as ""the greatest experience for hardcore, long time MMO players"". At the same time, one can easily refer to it as ""the most boring, time sink filled, banal and repetitious computer gaming experience ever fabricated in mind or reality"". Unless you're a masochist this game is not for you. In my humble opinion.

Support and Service
Your petitions for support/assistance are only handled during scheduled outages. Even so, it routinely takes ten or more hours for issues to be addressed, and roughly half the time the issues are not resolved. Once my character became ""locked"", that is, the client would crash whenever I attempted to log into it. I was told two days after submitting my petition that this was due to a bug that required game master intervention, and that they had corrected it. However, all of my resources that I had spent a week collecting were missing. I politely requested assistance acquiring the lost items (a typical and benign problem in all MMOs). I was denied, told that it was not in the EULA (odd that they would refer to the end user license agreement for software for this issue) and - get this - actually told by support that I can feel free to cancel my subscription. Heh. Amazing customer service there. So I did.

Conclusion
Old technology and graphics, constant outages, poor audio, repetitious game play filled with outdated time sinks, and extremely poor customer support. I recommend avoiding this game.","Mediocre in every way, very poor support",1217116800,4,,

Case one is the atrocious amount of screen tearing in the Xbox 360 version of the game.  It's everywhere, even in the cut scenes.  Case two is the blatant misrepresentation of how this game was going to look and play.  ACM is definately not the version of the game I saw in the demo.  Whole levels and cut scenes have either been restructered for the worse or ommitted altogether.  The creepy ambient lighting that was hyped is practically non-existent, replaced by a dull, gray glow.

The decline started with last years hokey grudges and alliances feature. Pressing the R2 button to draft was unrealistic. It has continued with the elimination of the cockpit view and elimination of customizable gameplay features. You can still set various assists and difficulty levels, but they are more part of a package system and do not allow you to adjust every aspect of racing AI and rules like in the past.

But there are improvements. The level of gameplay modes is huge. The creation of various racing series is very good. The inclusion of more road courses adds great variety. The graphics and sound and the best yet. The sense of speed and framerate are superb. And it is online.

However, losing the cockpit view is a HUGE loss. NASCAR Dirt to Daytona could do it despite having various racing classes... so EA's omission is either intentional or lazy. Most will not agree since EA is targeting this to younger gamers and EA figures the hardcore NASCAR crowd will buy it whether they like it or not. Whether they trade it back in doesn't matter... they got their money. But the cockpit view provides an immersive simulator experience similar to a first person shooter. When you drive a car you do not drive it from the bumper or from behind... you drive it from inside the vehicle. But since so many huge games such as Gran Turismo and Need for Speed do not provide a cockpit view EA figures they can get away with it.

If you are a teenager or new to NASCAR you will probably love this game. But if you are used to playing simulator racers such as MotoGP3, F1, IndyCar and TOCA race driver then the direction EA is taking this series will probably make you sick. We're part of a dying class that will have to suck it out on unstable PC platforms. I'm sticking with NASCAR 2003 on the PS2, when drafting was a matter of accurate physics and not a press of the button.

A real interesting fact is the lack of the EA Sports Bio with this game. The fact the EA ommited it means they must have really rushed this game to get it to market before the official Chase to the Cup begins in two weeks. When was the last time EA ommited a blatant marketing tool such as the EA Bio? EA is the king of marketing.

Bottom line... if you are a sim racer then NASCAR 2005 is not for you. I'm sure EA is counting on the sim crowd to buy the PC version and leave the console version to rack up big sales with trendy younger demographic. That's why EA is the king I guess... but if they treated Madden this way and added arcade elements then America would revolt. The fact that EA has exclusive rights to NASCAR for several more years is frustrating indeed. Buy the year 2007 I'm sure power-ups will be littering Daytona or Bristol to give you car extra boost ala Mario Kart.

Seriously, words need a poet to describe how utterly evil and destructive to the gaming industry EA has become over the last 12 or so years. This is a company that is buying out all the rights (using money they made from making groundbreaking, legendary games in the past that Maxis influenced) to publish any game having to do with Professional sports, college sports and simulation games just to name a few. I wouldn't care less if that was the end of the story, however, Now they are now almost done buying out the entire industry, EA is churning out the most lazily programmed, bland, boring and predictable games using ideas almost 2 decades old.
I grew up with playing the Sims. I started with 1 in middle school and moved up to what I think is the pentacle of the series Sims 2 in high school. I bought every expansion pack for it using money I had saved for months. Almost my whole summer of 2006 was devoted to staring at the computer screen for hours upon hours. The days seemed to meld into each other. Then my first year of college, Sims 3 made its debut. I was heartbroken. It seemed like all the heart and soul had been vaccumed out of the series. The best items where put behind a pay wall by EA. Additionally, even the most bleeding edge processors at the time could not handle the strain Sims 3 put on them. So I lost almost all interest in the Sims until very recently (2014) when affordable technology was just catching up to the programming of Sims 3.

Now we are living in the future playing the 4th installment of this game and I couldn't be more disappointed. They ripped out all the innovative and fun things that made Sims 2 and 3 unique and left in all of the bad parts. I guess the programmers decided if they couldn't program a working, real-time, breathing town the first time, they might as well give up. I guess they were afraid that if they couldn't get the new Simcity (a dedicated city builder) to work right, then making it work for Sims that had 24 hour schedules was just too hard. As another reviewer on amazon said about it, EA knows you are going to spend the money on it anyway. Which I think hits the nail on the head. Also of course just as last time, buying the old expansion packs doesn't mean anything and are not in any way compatible with Sims 4. The graphics seem similar enough from Sims 3 that you should be at least be able to import items, if not Sims and properties from 3. So I guess if you want to have the whole Sims 4 experience you are going to have to shell out another $500 dollars and wait another 4 years for the expansion packs. Not to mention the money you are going to be spending on all the good items EA puts behind an ONLINE PAY WALL. All that on top of dropping $70 on one of the most expensive production games in history. Let me tell you this game is not worth $70. Its not even worth buying for $40 in my opinion.

Sure there are a couple of new things to this edition. Sims can muti-task (if told to). The create-a-sim tools are slightly more user friendly and powerful, and Sims seem to an extent more social and interesting. (Rather than constantly sitting on their ass watching TV or computer games literally all day long before they starve half to death and wet their pants.) Beyond that, I don't see why anyone would like this edition over 2 or 3. (or even 1).

In closing, if I had any stock at all in EA I would be selling it. If I had any money I would be buying it short. This is a company that is destroying its own game franchises almost on a level of sabotage, over charging for new games we've played years ago, and insisting that you put more money into a game that you have already purchased to make it remotely playable for good measure. If this is now the level at which these guys produce games now, I don't see Sims 5 or Simcity 5 being nearly successful as its predecessors in this lifetime.

Unbelievable.  You wonder how that could happen.  You gotta verify two things: that it sounds ok through the earphones, and sounds ok from the mic, and there's no variation at all in the systems that it is being used with, so it's the simplest thing to test imaginable.

Like others have said, very comfortable headphones, nice sound, but useless mic.  And personally I'm not swallowing the ""the good news is it's not the mic"" nonsense.  All it takes is one look at the mic to know that it's poorly designed.  The mic doesn't point at your mouth!  So it's recording from your ear! So it would have to have a omni-directional pickup pattern, which means that even if the mic were decent, and boosted enough to hear, you'd still be getting a ton of ambient noise.  It would probably pick up noise from behind you better than your actual voice ironically, that's of course if it actually worked at all.  Ugh, what a disappointment.  Nice job Polk.

1.0,False,"02 16, 2009",A18AQ3EFPYBKH0,B000GG1OXA,Craig B.,"When the game was first launched, it was filled with bugs and missing a lot of content (like land mounts, you had to run everywhere).  The bugs and lack of content gave the game a bad name right from the start, and it never recovered.

I started playing a few months later after most of the launch bugs had been worked out and new content had been put into the game. I really enjoyed it.  There were about 32 different classes/professions to choose from, and you could change them as often as you wanted to try new things.  I myself started doing ""entertaining"", then changed to an armorsmith and a combat profession.  You could have any combination you wanted.

Many people complained, as people tend to do, about combat class balances, and this and that.  Sony decided that trying to balance 32 classes/professions was just to much work, so they decided to group several professions into a few to make the job easier, or just flat get rid of some.  So came the ""CU"" (combat upgrade).  This was not taken well by many players, and several left the game.  I myself still found the game still playable, but not nearly as enjoyable.  I wanted to keep crafting, but now I was stricly a crafter, and could no longer engage in combat because I could not have more than one profession at a time.  I would find myself wondering the land being ""one-shot"" by every low level creature around.  I couldn't check my harvesters that collected the resources I needed without a few deaths.  I couldn't collect skins that I needed to craft since I could no longer kill anything.  Yet, it was still barely playable, so I stayed.

Sony, under pressure from Lucas Arts to make the game a success, hurried out yet another large change, that became known as the NGE.  What is really sad about this is how they went about it.  A new expansion was about to come out.  They advertised the heck out of that new expansion and started taking pre-orders for it, charging peoples credit cards for the expansion before it came out.  Two days after they started doing pre-orders for the expansion they announced the major NGE changes.  This upset most everyone who felt they had been tricked.

They also told players there were going to be changes to professions coming soon.  They had announced the first class to be changed, and told players what they planned to do with it.  If I remeber correctly, it was going to be a support class that wasn't played much, but I can't remember the name of it.  They were great ideas (like being able to stealth, and tons of others) and changes that the class had badly needed for some time.  Yet, here they were working on this NGE that would destroy the very class they claimed to be preparing to make major upgrades to.  It just seemed after the fact that Sony was just stringing along people to keep them around as long as they could.  After all, why would they be working to make major profession changes they knew were going to be pointless in just weeks?  Did one hand not know what the other hand was doing?

When the announcement of the NGE came, almost instantly you could log onto a test server to try it out for yourself and give feedback on it.  This was no normal test though.  They already had planned the release of the NGE to live servers in only like a week away, and were unwilling to change it with the Christmas shopping season coming.  You can't do a whole lot of testing and bug fixes in a week.  So, this was coming out one way or another, no matter what the player base had to say about it. And it was unusual how fast it was all happening.  They gave us a much longer heads up for the CU.

The funny part is no one could test it because the first thing you had to do was get on the Millenium Falcon, which was broken.  So, no one could get past that to even test the game for the first couple days.  But, by god it went live on time, regardless of whether it worked or not.

It was a nightmare.  Nothing worked when the NGE went live.  Sony defended it's actions and even lied.  They told the world that it had been eagerly accepted by players and that it was drawing in a large number of new players.  We knew better, but it took a long time before they admitted it.  I even watched a developer from the game go on G4TV to show what a great new change this all had been.  The host of the show who interviewed him basiclly called the players who were complaining whiners and crybabies.  The developer then showed something on the new and exciting game, and guess what, it didn't work because it was broken, but then played it off as if it worked as promised.  I don't know if they paid G4 for that interview, because it certainly wasn't unbiased.

It's amazing to look back at it all and see just how much went wrong.  They basicly showed the gaming world what not to do.  To bad they had to drag thousands of us along for the ride with so many empty promises and outright lies.",It's really sad what this once decent game has become,1234742400,4,,

The ""Franchise mode"" in this game is horrible.
There is a lot of information missing that is needed to run a team.

I need to know how long their contract is, what are his stats for the preason, age.....

I'm just supposed to cut players based on their overall????

Another example is free agency.

Why can't I see their career stats, season stats?  What teams has he played for? maybe played for a rival.  What if they are speedy but have low catch rating??

I wanted to try it on PC and found it for a reasonable price, so I pulled the trigger.

Well, there went $10 down the drain.

The game loaded up just fine and it's a beautiful looking game provided you're absolutely stationary. Once you hit the gas, the game becomes unplayable. The stuttering was so, so bad. I was probably getting 15 frames per second, if that. What was more puzzling was the number of invisible walls I ran into. When training as a cop I was tasked with a rapid response. I was moving along at 15 frames per second when suddenly my car just stopped moving (it happened at the same place on the map with a racer car as well). The timer in the top right corner continued to run, the trees keep moving, the engine was still roaring, but I was completely still for a good forty seconds. If it happens once, you can deal with it, but it happened multiple times.

It's a bummer because I enjoy the franchise. I just wonder if the Frostbite engine is the right way to go. For my money Hot Pursuit looks just as good and that game came out nearly five years ago.

1.0,True,"03 16, 2014",A36MA2U1XT52FY,B00AK4QB22,Chris C.,"I will start with the most frustrating part of this game and nitpick from there.
While playing, my character will battle groups of enemies.  Often the camera will decide to start spinning itself into an awkward view.  As you attempt to correct this view, since the same button for moving the camera is the switch target button, my character will spin completely around and target archers, trolls, random npcs in the distance instead of the enemies hitting me in the face at that very moment.  Also, when I actually manage to kill one of the enemies in these groups that I am locked onto, my character will not unlock on the target until he is finished laying down half the time, even though the enemy is dead.  This leads to my character leaning over and smacking the floor a couple times, placing the back of my neck in perfect position for the other enemy's axe cleave.  Since the execution style beheading appears to line up so perfect, so many times, I am unsure whether this was actually unintentional.  The game is not so much hard as having the controls a jumble of madness that can't be edited.  Perhaps on PC, the game would be better since you could hopefully edit this.  I've found the best way to actually defeat groups of enemies is just run off, and the ones at the back of the group will decide to abandon their brave leader to run back to their spawn locations.
When you have an enemy locked on and said enemy falls down, a minigame begins that attempts to see how close your character can swing his blade at the enemy without actually hitting them, kind of like the knife game from Aliens.
When you spend all the time to gather souls, it is then time to level up.  Each time you want to level your character, you have to teleport back to the main camp, speak to a certain character, that lacks a short term memory.  Therefore each time you must have to button through 4 lines of delayed dialog, to get to a menu to level up.  Sometimes this character decides that their spiel is not long enough and decides to be sitting down.  This would not be a problem if the character rose up faster than the old lady at the front of the airplane.

The bad: There is very little instruction during many of the missions so you'll find yourself failing a lot and having no idea what you're doing wrong or what you should be doing instead. I find it funny that they realized how bad some of the missions are and chose to put in a skip mission option rather than just make the missions better, more playable, or just put in some further instructions on those missions.

The driving is sub par with cars overly willing to spin out and lose control rather than maintain course after even the slightest of collisions which makes moving around the game very frustrating and time consuming. So you'll find yourself calling for cabs a lot, but frequently they don't show up at all or take several minutes to show up and by then you've lost patience and took off on foot. There is far too much traffic as well slowing you down that much more and the roads are usually just a little too narrow to try and squeeze between all the cars on the road. It all just makes for a slow frustrating experience.

Unlike GTA 4 where your cheat codes can be typed in one time and then they automatically save in the character's phone for future quick access under fire, in the xbox 360 version at least, they are around 12 buttons long and have to be entered on the fly while playing. Then to make it worse, the cheat codes consist of buttons that you wouldn't want to press during shootouts or while driving. For example, you're driving down the freeway at god knows what speed and have to enter a code but the code has the Y button in it so when youenter the code the player jumps from the moving vehicle and dies!!!! How does that help exactly? Again, just slows you down and makes for a very slow and frustrating experience.

Lastly, one of the absolute most fun parts of past GTA games was the ability to utilize the cheat codes to access guns and body armour  and get into huge shootouts with the cops and here and there put the code in again to keep your heath up so extend the fun of watching the police force get bigger and bigger until they call in the actual army and you basically fighting a one man war, and winning!!! Now how ever, in combination with the cheat codes being so slow, the cop's are far more leathal and will kill you way too fast for you to have any fun. Boring!!!

Don't know why people think that a game that you can lose you character at anytime of the game forever is fun. There is no levelling up that you can control in the game, you have to go with the story flow but your enemies outgrow you in immense pace so your character will be eliminated in no time and having that annoying face showing up on the screen telling you he / she is dead. Even when you character levelled up , the stats is so random that sometimes he / she just levelled up but with no improvement in stats at all. Since most of the time they only level up inside the game, if their stats don't go up, tough, they are doomed on the battle field. The number of enemies you usually have out grow you so much that they can basically kill your characters in one or two hits. If you don't want to lose your character, time to reset and do the battle all over again. I have no idea why people find this kind of game fun and challenging. Disgaea and FF Tactics are fun because you grow with the characters. They can die but you can revive them so you won't be losing your hard work.

Don't fall for the high rating reviews and don't write off the low rating reviews either. I'm sorry, but someone has to either be the lone exception to the majority at best, or paid to give this game anything other than a bad rating. Even Game Informer gave it high ratings when they ""tested"" it but once it was released admitted it was full of flaws and problems. IT DOESN'T WORK! How can you rate anything above a total failure, no matter your love of the series, if it DOESN'T WORK? I gave it time to be fixed, for the creators to correct their errors and they have completely failed me (and many of us). Don't take my word for how bad this is but don't take the word of these ""high"" ratings either. Read the ""high rating"" reviews and you'll notice patterns, repetition, and similar statements. Even some mention the crashes and multiple other issues but still rate it high. Stick with III and IV and hope that if there is a VI it will make us forget there was ever a Civilization V.",Finally have to give in and admit this is a horrible game,1337731200,9,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC Download'}",

1.0,True,"11 7, 2008",A1UQ4029LCS7,B001DDBBSS,Spm G.,"I've been Wii Fitting for a few months and love it - I do it every day, but my problem with it is that I spend 20 minutes on yoga, 25 minutes on strength, and end up only having another 15 for cardio. I was hoping to use this title 3 days a week for a full-on cardio hour. Sadly, it ain't gonna happen.

Here are my problems

- Avatar selection is crap compared to Wii Fit. You can't even change your hair color! On top of that the graphics are terrible - the quality is low and it's the same thing over and over.

- The instructions don't show you how to do the exercises. Often, the animated character ""showing"" you how to do it conflicts with the text explaining how to do it below. It would be nice to have a video of Jillian doing it.

- Most of the time you have to do the exercises completely different than the instructions to get the game to actually sense what you're doing.

- The game doesn't respond to movements well at all. The first day I had no problem with the Grenade Toss game, but today it wasn't registering my squats to pick the grenades up. I had to whip the controller and nunchuck downwards for the game to realize I was going down, which threw off my balance. It was pointless.

- The music, out of the blue, will stop. I found no way to get it back.

- The music screen will only stay on the screen if you hold b, but if you do that then you can't select anything!

- The log walk is pointless. Stand still and you'll get across the same speed and balance as if you were trying!

- With the Wii Fit board it's impossible to do anything! I used it for the cannon game and couldn't pick up a cannon ball. I turned off the board and suddenly I could pick them up just with the remote/nunchuck.

- You can't use the direction pad in menus, using the remote is really show.

- The voice tracks done by Jillian are repetitive and boring and not inspirational at all.

- Most of the tips given are common sense, and some baffle me - in one she recommends putting skim milk in your coffee. She recommends drinking coffee? Caffeine? I just can't imagine a trainer who recommends coffee!

- There's no way to find out how many minutes you've done so far in the workout without quitting.

- On Rowing you have to throw your arms around so savagely to get the highest power that I actually hurt my shoulder doing it.

- In boxing you're supposed to ""jog in place"" to get to the next punch or kick, but you have to move the remote/nunchuck up and down RAPIDLY to get to the next move, which doesn't happen naturally with jogging. The worst part is you're moving them so rapidly that it ends up doing the punch for you. The left kick, though, is next to impossible to do - it just doesn't register.

- Tire Trail requires you to slam the controllers down so hard that it knocks you off balance as you're on one leg.

- The Punching Bag Dodge just does not register your movements, except for 2 times I squatted.

- Today I did a 60 minute work out, but in the stats menu it tells me I did 0.

The only benefit I found from an hour with this title was my shoulders and upper back were worked out well with the rowing, monkey bars and logs (before I realized it was fakery), and my legs with the cannon ball and grenade pickups. I didn't get a real workout, though, as my heart rate didn't go up very far. I'm going to go back to my Wii Fit and just add in some squats and lunges while one of those non-board Yoga moves is running to keep my timing, or maybe the tricep workout to keep count. I might even do some of the balancing arm moves too... but this game is getting traded in tomorrow.",I am so disappointed :(,1226016000,2,,

In concept this should be a great fun thing for toddlers and preschoolers to learn while having fun. Seems like the kind of thing the Wii was made for right?

  Too bad the execution is so shoddy.  The game itself has potential, bright colorful graphics and nice sound and voices by the original voice actors from the show. But the controls are completely screwed up from the get go.  Case in point, you want controller 1 to be the one held by the child and that's the controller that has the character slip cover on it MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO START THE GAME WITH THAT CONTROLLER BECAUSE IT COVERS THE AIMING MECHANISM OF THE WIIMOTE!!!

  Then, once you start the game and go through the tedious task of switching controllers in the menu, the game just does not seem to read the motions with any degree of accuracy at all making even this simple control scheme (tilt right or left to change, 2 or jump to select) an exercise in frustration for child and parent alike. The controls are further hobbled by the decision to not use the Wii Plus add on making an already messed up wiimote have even less chance of working in any meaningful way. Dumb dumb dumb! You can literally tilt for minutes on end trying to get the right letter highlighted only to have it switch at the last second to the wrong one when the kid jumps to select.

Gearbox is and always has been a mediocre game developer. Their big claim to fame is borderlands which is essentially if you put world of warcrafts boring quest system into a wasteland, put it in first person mode, then tout how it has millions of guns but the fact is 1 out of 10,000 are actually an upgrade (repainting the same crummy pistol 5,000 times doesn't make 5,000 different guns) and finally start pimping DLC for the game before it even releases and then keep releasing more to nickel and dime your customers to death by turning a 60 dollar turd into a 100 dollar turd. They also made duke nukem forever which as we all know is a giant steaming pile of you know what and is a god awful abortion from start to finish. The best games they actually made were the brothers in arms games which aren't as terrible as those other two games but its still incredibly sterile, generic and uninspired. BIA is your basic mediocre WW2 shooter and nothing else. They have a few other games under their belt but they are all titles no one really cares about and faded into obscurity as soon as they were released. Bottom line is Gearbox is a terrible game maker and this is a terrible game.

They tried to wink at the fans so hard their eyes have fallen out because of it. Everything about it feels very amateur, boring and forced. It feels more like they did a sci-fi channel original aliens movie, or something that went direct to video.

The game is buggy as you can get. I've flown out the side of things and floated high in the air stuck. I've had allies that would stick in walls. Hell I found out in section you were supposed to be stealthy starting out and I just ran past every alien and once I passed them they forgot about me and I finished a level without firing a shot.

All the pretty and cool looking screenshots and videos I've been seeing for over a year from now weren't from the same game they released. You can easily find comparison videos showing the game released looks just awful compared to the ""in game footage"" they showed in the past.

Multiplayer is very sterile and pretty much what you'd expect. It's so boring in fact that multiplayer will be a ghost town in 2 months.

The game play its pretty much call of duty. It's just a mix of ""it's the last stand....again"" and ""quick run through fast as you can"" with some boring corridor stalking in between.

I could go into great depth, I could go on and on naming other things I didn't like but you can read other Amazon reviews and see exactly what I've got to say.

YES, this game DOES have evil secuROM DRM hidden in the software, but that is =>NOT<= the sole reason why I gave this game 1 star overall.

I have been a long time GTA fan, playing the series way back in the day when the original birds eye view game came out in the late 90s. Time and time again, rockstar has proved its expertise in making an expansive satirical game ahead of its time.

However, on this PC port, Rockstar and Take2 Interactive have seriously dropped the ball.

The game is undeniably addicting, and provides amazing possibilities for game play. The graphics are gorgeous, the world is expansive, and there are a ton of new features which would be a dream come true for me if there was not one teeny flaw with this production:

This PC port should still be in its alpha stages.

Its been nearly a decade since I've bought a game so riddled with errors, sloppy programming, and altogether looks like the afterbirth of console title. Clearly this title was prematurely pushed out just to sneak it in time for the holiday season. To give you a solid idea of what is wrong with the game, let me give you some hard examples of the flaws in its design.

#1- All PC versions of the game have SecuROM (Yes, even the Steam version that I bought. Effectively this means 2 DRMs)
#2- Your high end 2000 dollar PC will struggle to turn out more than 40 fps due to bad programming (I should know, my computer gets around 35 fps. See my specs below)
#3- You are required to register with TWO online accounts (three if you use steam). How much money do you think Take 2 Interactive is getting from selling your consumer rights by forced registry?
#4- Does not work with SLI, has many rendering problems, and the solution is to use a beta driver which in my case BRICKED my computer.
#5- Does not work well with background programs. (Many people recommend shutting down key security programs like your firewall or anti-virus.)
#6- Several errors with multiplayer (remember those 2 mandatory online registration processes, they don't work too with multiplayer)

This is hogwash. I hope this shoddy work bites the corporate executive who forced this game out so quickly. I'd much rather have waited a year and had all these issues removed.

I'd like to rant right now about how Rockstar should have learned from EA's Spore and SecuROM, but apparently over 100 other reviewers have that one well covered, so I'll spare you.

I love computer/video games, especially RPG's (e.g., the Star Wars: KOTOR series, Fallout series, Fable series, Mass Effect series, Elder Scrolls series), and was excited when I heard all of the sterling reviews for this game.  I had heard about the extreme difficulty, but thought the ""most difficult game ever"" talk was probably hyperbole.

I could not have been more wrong.  I love a challenge, and do not like games that have no penalty at all for dying.  However, there is a fine line between challenging the player and presenting overly frustrating difficulty that saps the game of any enjoyment, and this game crosses that line within the first 30 minutes of play.

I can accept that bosses should be formidable enemies in a RPG, but when even lowly skeleton warriors encountered early in the game can decimate you within seconds, I think the game has gone a bit too far.

Beyond the insane difficulty, it seems the designers went out of their way to irritate the player: no ability to pause(?!), you can only save at campfires (and then if you do, enjoy re-fighting all the enemies you defeated that will respawn!), and often no clear direction as to where to proceed next.  I happen to think that features in recent RPG's like the ""Save Anywhere"" function and the ""Next Quest"" marker in Fallout 3/Fallout: New Vegas/Mass Effects 1 and 2, while undoubtedly designed to make those games appeal to a mass audience, are improvements to the RPG formula that make them MORE enjoyable to play.

To the ""hardcore"" or ""old-school"" gamers that love the unrelenting challenge that ""Dark Souls"" throws at you endlessly- more power to you, and if you think most games out there today are way too easy, I wholeheartedly recommend ""Dark Souls"" to you.  While I enjoy a FAIR challenge, I also view video/computer games as a way to relax, and I see ""Dark Souls"" as a game you FIGHT, not PLAY.

BTW: I am not certain it is a coincidence that this game does not have a demo on Xbox Live (at least as of the date of this review); one wonders if the designers are concerned how many copies of this game they might sell if most people had a chance to see just how overly difficult it is.

Finally, I have to say that I view an excellent RPG as being similar to a good book- one that gives the player a hand in shaping how a great story unfolds.  ""Dark Soul""'s story is almost nonexistent.

So, for those gamers on the fence about ""Dark Souls"" that have read the glowing reviews for this game: buyer beware- TRY BEFORE YOU BUY.  As for me, I will wait for Skyrim and Mass Effect 3.",Thank Goodness for Redbox......,1318032000,36,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I think they are trying to fix things, but they have done so many things wrong so far that I just can't give this game a good rating. I have been plagued with problem after problem.

I have two copies of this game. My girlfriend and my best friend both bought me a copy without speaking with one another. It was very sweet. Well, I also have two computers that can play this game. One is a custom built computer and the other is a Mac. Well I convinced my girlfriend to play with me. The only problem is... well, we couldn't play the game together. Why, you might ask? Well, I could install it on my Mac just fine. There was no problem other than the considerable lag. I had to drop the video settings of course, but there was just constant lag.

No, I couldn't play with her because there was an installation problem on my PC. It took 3 days of troubleshooting to finally figure it out. You know, uninstall, reinstall, re-download the client. Run as admin. Run in XP mode. Nothing worked. No I had to manually kill the agent.exe process and manually start the process from within a folder before I could actually run Diablo 3 and install it. That made it work. None of the other stuff like updating my system, disabling my anti-virus, running in compatibility mode or anything made this game work. So, Blizzard, you failed big on this one. 3 days without being able to play.

What was my next problem? Oh, the constant lag is a constant problem. Updating things like my network adapter and reworking my wiring didn't fix anything. Checking my channels to find the best reception didn't help. It still lags.

The first few days the servers were constantly down. The auction house IS constantly down. The servers are still constantly down for some kind of maintenance. They threw this piece of crap out onto the market before ever really doing much. This doesn't feel like 12 years of planning and thinking for a new game. This feels like some piece of crap game they put together in about a year.

Then about a week in my buddy gets hacked and loses all of his stuff. Seems odd, but didn't surprise me too much as he isn't too big on passwords. I knew that. Oh, but a few days later my account gets hacked. Then I am in the forums noticing that there are a lot of people being hacked. Then another friend was hacked. Does this really sound that common to you? You think people who have been gaming for years get hacked this easily? No this was a Blizzard problem. Did they help me out? Sure.. in a way. Let me tell you how they helped me out. First, it took 24 hours to even respond. Then it took another 24 hours for them to let me know that I had to make sure I understood what a ""rollback"" was. How insulting to my intelligence. Then they finally rolled me back after another 24 hours. They didn't offer to give me any gold or help me out in any way. I was out millions of gold in items, 150,000 gold in definite gold lost from the roll back, a day lost on a character that I was working on, and the lame moderator just makes some snarky comments and says it's all taken care of now. Meanwhile the items I did have depreciated badly because the economy changed so quickly. I basically lost 3-4 days worth of game time and all kinds of other things because Blizzard is compromised. I made some suggestions for their security, but I am sure it fell on deaf ears. They just want everyone to use their authenticators because they assure everyone is 100% impossible to hack. Bullcrap. I'm not even saying it was impossible to hack me before, but it shouldn't have been easy.

The only light at the end of the tunnel is that I see some changes coming that might make the game worth swallowing in some ways. There are still tons of problems. They are firm on not letting people go ""free world"" in the game like Diablo 2. You have to select a quest and go from there. It's tedious. The farming is tedious. The game is tedious. There is no more rushing really. The leveling is boring.

I'll be honest. I would have been happy with Diablo 2 with a few changes in there. I wanted similar characters and play styles. They took powerful characters and a fun game and made it tedious.

They were even so arrogant as to point out that ""there is no cow level"" on loading screens. Oh, you mean one of the funnest things in Diablo 2 isn't in your game anymore and you think that is a good thing? Oh, let me shake your hand. Then there is this new unicorn level that they make ridiculously tedious (noticing a pattern here) to get into. I haven't even gone into it yet, because I don't feel like trying to farm the 5-6 different pieces required and the 100,000 gold item to make the level and not gain anything from it other than maybe a few giggles while slaughtering a unicorn.

PC gamers put CoD on the map and they turn around and spit in our faces. I'm embarrassed that I spent my hard earned dollars on this turd and am really kicking myself for not checking the reviews here first.
The Pros:
Amazing Graphics, really polished visuals with varied and beautiful locales.
Gritty, adult oriented story and missions.
Very intense single player battles
The Cons:
I bought this at 8pm last night and I just beat it. It's 10am now and yes, I got a full night's sleep between then and now.
Multiplayer is some kiddy console matchmaker system that doesn't make use of servers.
9v9 max for multiplayer. No epic battles here.
No servers means no huge battles, no custom maps, no mods, to sum it up: NO RE-PLAYABILITY.
Steam. I'm not in the ""Steam=SecuROM"" camp but I still think it sucks. I've found it to be buggy and unreliable and I resent being forced to use it to play a supposed A-list game.
The single player campaign is fun despite being so short. I'll probably play through it once more today, maybe spend a day or two on the wimpy and dull multiplayer, then put this game on the shelf and dream of what else I could have spent my money on. Tomorrow or the next day, after I uninstall it (along with that stupid Steam program) I'll play a World at War custom map on a server with 31 other frag happy gamers.
Conclusion:
Wait until this hits the bargain bin. This game is more of an expansion than a full release. The single player campaign is worth maybe $20-$30 while the multiplayer is an affront to all things PC gamers hold dear. Seriously, if I wanted to play an Xbox game I would buy an Xbox.

The cut scenes are good and the camera at the beginning (i sold it after that) was reasonably good. This game just feels like a sub-par resident evil. Even the graphics are not upto resie standards the developers didn't use pre renders like capcom so the areas look ok at best. The enemies are reasonably well animated and look solid enough but don't provide the visual oomph that resie's deadites do. You shouild be able to see the flesh hanging off them but nope.

The battle system was a good attempt and it sounded great on paper but it just didn't pan out. As has been mentioned, the number of enemies and the speed of enemies took away from the battle. Also, the monotony of the enemies left me wanting. During one area of the game, in the Sandsea, I had a chain of 164, I wasn't trying to get chain points, either. No matter how good the battle system was designed, 164 of the same enemy, in a row, gets boring.

The license system seemed more like a dumbed down version of the sphere grid in FFX. I loved the sphere grid, wasn't so fond of this system. Obtaining the experience through battle to increase your abilities would have made this a success, requiring abilities to also be bought made it a failure. At level 20, Penelope had cleared the Magick section of the grid, although, her highest level magick that was of use was Cura...hardly an impressive skill.

The storyline was like riding a snail. Too many cut-scenes and not enough interesting developments. The gil distribution was down-right ridiculous. Leveling up for hours, exploring every nook-and-cranny of a dungeon, and still not having enough money to improve your weapons...there just wasn't a good balance. There needs to be a healthy dose of risk and reward to keep it interesting, in past games, leveling up was just as fun as progressing the story...it felt like a necessary chore in FFXII. For nearly every enemy I remember, you got 1 license point per kill. By a rough estimation, 1800 enemies would need killed to clear one section of the licensing system.

The last rant was the character classes, or lack of. Any character can be anything you want and carry any weapon you want (for a necessary price). While the openness can be good, it makes for rather boring characters and the excitement of getting new skills for a class is completely lost. After all, so what if Vaan gets that new axe when Basche is right behind (note: I mentioned a weapon...there are no special abilities unique to any character, either).

Between the lack of rewards, gil, ability increases with experience, and monotony of battles, I would not recommend this game. I put 20 hours into the game and completely lost interest midway through a hunt (the mini-games are bland and the rewards for completing a hunt are nothing to get excited about, comparable to defeating a difficult enemy in previous FF games). I believe you can make a decision as to whether you will enjoy this game with a rental. Naturally, another person may like everything I ranted on above. Like any FF game, you hate the learning curve from the previous for a few hours and then become addicted...I lost interest in the middle of the addiction-stage.",Wanted to like it...,1164153600,28,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I hadn't even bothered to touch this since Madden 2012 and I thought maybe after 5 years things had improved.  WRONG.

Pros - You get to play a football game, but it could be so much better

Cons...

1.  Tiresome overly complicated menus.  EA wasted more time and energy on bogus presentation and complicated menus than they did on actual game play and real game improvements.  Play calling is horrendous now with the menus they have.

2.  Redundant pathetic coaching reactions to EVERY play get so tiresome, it takes that much longer to play the game.  I see Jim Caldwell on my screen more than my actual players and I really could care less what he thinks.

3.  Poor tackling and horrible physics.  It's sad that a game like NFL 2K (and I hate bringing this game up) is far superior at 10 years old and EA is still lagging behind and hasn't figured it out yet.  Guys look like they are drowning out there when they flop around.  Ridiculous passes and catches that are something out of a Matrix movie.

4.  Pathetic defending.  Played a guy online who couldn't move the ball against me except for his standard hail mary to Larry Fitzgerald to catch the ball in double and triple coverage, no matter what defense was selected.  Scored both his TDs this way with the epic ""aggressive catch"".  I'd really love to know how receivers in the NFL actually decide which catch they make isn't aggressive.  This was an absolute joke of an idea.

5.  Excessive fumbling.  You can breathe on a player and he'll cough the ball up after you're putting together a solid drive.

The bottom line is nothing is going to change until people hit the NFL and EA where they hurt...their wallets.

Not everybody knows that:
You cannot play this offline
You need a constant connection to the destiny servers which is very unreliable get ready for your game to be interrupted even with a good connection.
You need to reach level 5 before you can do multiplayer.
This is not a proper mmo like eve online
Despite all the hype prepares to be underwhelmed both by the lack of depth of the story or any real action do not believe the trailers.

This is not open world or sandbox there's nothing to explore you go on these dull missions kill someone then go back to the tower.
The enemy just spawn in the same place.
Also the story ends at the introduction and only gets mentioned every now and again

Story
I really wanted this to be good but alas it's just not worth your time an empty lonely game experience with a story that could have been amazing. If you're a story driven person I'm afraid like many online only games the main story just becomes a back story it's so sad.

Action
Also if you're not into level grinding then you may want to give this a miss as the enemy have main spawn points which they don't go out of and not long after killing all the enemy they will spawn back again.
The a.i's are not as intelligent as those used in say killzone or halo (throw a grenade at an elite he will try and commando roll out of the way not stand there like a moron)all in all they enemy are not fun to fight but pretty boring. The only interesting action comes from multiplayer but with that many better multiplayers' out there and more coming out again you'd better spend your money elsewhere.

Levels
As I mentioned the levels have nothing to explore in them if you're expecting something like skyrim or fallout 3 with a living world populated by interesting events, locations and npc's prepare to be shocked.
Take earth for instance you will have to keep going back to the same location for all of the missions so in real terms destiny is actually very small but this is the same for the other locations off planet.

Conclusion
At first glance it really seem's good but after a few hours play and then a few more you realize there is not actually a lot there in terms of story characters or action.

First off, this is an actual good improvement of MW2. Everything is greatly tweaked, everything looks nice, and the co-op is top notch. But if you plan on making a 5* product on the PC, IW, you can't cut features and then raise the price. There's absolutely no excuse for reason for charging $60 for this game. That's a -1*. Greed should never be rewarded. Then there's the lack of dedicated servers. P2P isn't the worst thing ever, but it's not good. It really is only as good as the host. That's another star removed. Then we took out mods. And the reason this was taken out is because now PC gamers have the ""privledge"" of spending $10 for 3-4 maps when they need some more cash. In other words, mods were taken out to solely make money. Greed. -2* for the greed and the removal of mods. That leaves us with 1*. That's about all this game is. A 1* title on the PC.

Oh boy. Let me be a little technical first before giving my gut feelings...
The INTERFACE was good at first glance. Not great, just good. It could have been far better. Some controls can be re-written, some can't and some re-written controls interfere with others when they aren't supposed to. For instance, chatting was a chore if you attempt to rekey anything on the keyboard. You don't want to be involved in a CHORE when you're fighting, talking and trying to stay alive.
The PvP is jacked all to heck and back with just a couple of classes being way over-strengthed with ""uber-rock-your-world-pwn"" abilities and or equipment. There is no reason at all to engage in PvP unless you just want to hear the other guy scream obscenities at you. Plus, the game is overrun with pets. Don't bother picking a mano-a-mano fight - those don't exist. You have your pets do all the fighting.
The WORLD is limited. A handful of planets with an area mapped out on each. Plenty of room to run around, but not much out there. Most of your time will be spent in cities getting killed over and over in spaceport.
The GAMEPLAY is somewhat like AO. Players can take missions for money, exp and faction points. Unfortunately, the missions send you out to only 2 different types of mission points: either a metal outhouse with 3 guys around it, or a smoking pile of poop with several animals around it. The SWG game was bought from UO as the defunct UO2 system, so I understand, which is why the game is based on animals and skins and bones and gut puddings...
The CRAFTING is at first impressive. At first. Both I and my wife took up crafting when we saw PvP was so pointless that we had nothing left to do. Diablo2 made my wrist ache sometimes, but no game like SWG has ever jacked my wrist all to heck. You WANT carpal tunnel? Play this game as a crafter. And I macroed as much as I could.
The BUGS in this game have yet to be fixed... whole classes broken, whole faction perks broken, nerfs to anything that gets whined about on the official boards... what's the worst you can imagine? SWG has it.
If you like the rebels, join this game. Rebels rule every single world in the SWG and walk the planets fully declared. The Empire has absolutely ZERO ballz in this universe. The Emporer is wetting his robe.
Okay, my gut feelings... this game has been taken over by the Pokemon players. You want to PvP? Make sure you have some handy Poke-pets to whip out of your datapad and say ""a"". That's the game. There are hardly any droids to speak of and this is supposed to be Star Wars? This game is a joke. I watched Star Wars in its theater debut in the 70s. This game bears NO resemblance. Background effects of TIE engine whines don't count when the whole game is based on Pokemon.

- Game locks up and freezes my brand new PS3 constantly, even when in single player mode.

- After a few hours of gameplay I encountered a crash so bad that I was greeted with a message saying my PS3 hard drive was corrupted, this has never happened before with any other games.

- Online game play is impossible.  Won't load, crashes, massive amount of glitches, stalls halfway through gameplay only to delete all progress made, other online players are often impossible to see making missions unachievable.

- After searching through hundreds of comments on GTA IV forums I can see this is an ongoing problem with MANY other customers.

- The game graphics are only fair at best.

- Characters are unispiring and quite boring, often times hard to understand without turning captions on.

- Missions are repetitive, dull and go nowhere.

1.0,False,"06 28, 2015",A3MZZGA8Q2W6DC,B0050SXLQC,C.E.F.,"I loved the early Resident Evil games (1-3).  They may have been cheesy at times, but they were also atmospheric, scary, and fun.  RE4 introduced the over-the-shoulder third-person shooter perspective but still retained the exploration element, and managed to strike a decent balance between the two.  In RE5 the series became a mediocre action game with one of the worst final boss battles I've ever experienced.  RE6 takes everything bad about RE5 and makes it even worse.

RE6 consists of four campaigns featuring 4 pairs of characters, whose stories intersect.  The first campaign, Leon Kennedy's, is the closest to the classic Resident Evil experience, and it has a few wisps of the series' classic horror roots, but it's deeply marred by all the changes to the formula the designers have made.  Gone are the days of waiting tensely as you LET a pair of zombies shamble toward you so you can take them down with one headshot each and conserve your ammo.  We now have large packs of zombies that all attack at once and take multiple headshots before dying, some of which can fire guns.  Yes, now we have zombies with GUNS.  Talk about ridiculous.  Zombies are everywhere, and there are large sections where you do nothing but run and shoot them while switching guns.  RE6 can't decide what kind of game it wants to be.  It plays like every other third-person shooter ever made, except the game rarely gives you enough ammo.  With fewer zombies and better pacing this could have made for a really tense experience, but when you run out you can still rely on a really powerful melee attack.  Why should I headshot a zombie three times (yes, three) to take it down when I can just R1 to knock it down, then R1 again to smash its head?  Huge, conspicuous ammo crates are stashed all over the game and are used to telegraph large shooting sections and boss battles well in advance.

Speaking of bosses, the ones in RE6 are terrible.  The boss of Leon's campaign goes through so many stupid transformations, and he Just.  Will.  Not.  DIE.  Then the two characters get separated as they always do, because let's repeat the worst co-op tropes we can find, and both players have to pass a series of stupid quick-time events or one person dies and you have to reload.  Ah, yes, the quick-time events.  In Resident Evil 6, they're EVERYWHERE, and they're awful.  Waggle a stick to escape an enemy's grasp.  Press a button really fast a bunch of times because this scene is exciting, look at how exciting it is!  Hit two buttons together with a quarter-second reaction time, or you instantly die and get to try again and THIS time you'll pass it now that you know what button-presses are coming.  Wow, that's fun.  Sarcasm.

As annoying as Leon's campaign is, Chris Redfield's is worse.  It's a pure third-person shooter, with still not enough ammo, that turns Resident Evil 6 into a big, dumb buddy action flick.  More right-on-cue plot points where the two characters get separated, more and bigger and stupider enemies, scenes where you race against the clock and practically have to fail at least once before you figure out what you need to do, wretched driving and flying sequences, areas where one character repeats the same line over and over if the game decides you aren't progressing quickly enough, and of course, gobs and GOBS of quick-time events.  The final boss was so bad that my friend and simply quit at this point, because neither of us was having the least bit of fun.

As a series, Resident Evil has ceased to be scary.  It tries to be a Hollywood action movie and fails miserably.  Resident Evil 6 is by far the worst entry to date.

The DRM is a part of the game that you can't avoid if you install it so I must focus my review on the DRM. Supposedly this game releases the authorization if you uninstall the game but what happens if there is a problem contacting the server at the time the uninstaller tries to do so? It probably won't release your install. What happens if your system crashes and you just format or you buy new hardware and forget to uninstall the game? Your authorization won't be released. Then you have to call them and hope that they believe you purchased the game in order to play once you run out of authorizations.

1.0,False,"03 26, 2014",AGCEZ20IHFDPA,B00GBCLG0E,R. P. Jesus,"I hate this controller.  It's awful for FPS and racing games.  Very uncomfortable.  Gripping a Dual Shock is never a treat but trying to grip it and working both analogs while pulling those mushy triggers is a nightmare.  The controller is wireless and comes with a tiny little charging cord but it's so short you won't be able to play games while it charges.  I looked into buying a third party controller but Sony frequently updates the system and at times disables select third party controllers they've deemed dangerous for the system.  I heard there's an inexpensive way to use 360 controllers on the PS3 (which sounds like a godsend) but 360 controllers don't have six axis making certain PS3 games incompatible.  :(

I was not aware that the PS3 updates itself all the time!  Every time I put a disc in, it updates, it installs.  I'm sitting there for ten minutes (at least) before I'm at the title screen.  (Metal Gear Solid: Guns of the Patriots took closer to an hour to install.) Why?  I played a little Uncharted 2 for the first time last Christmas, ten minutes later I'm playing the game, then I put it away for a while until about a week ago--AND IT WANTS TO UPDATE AGAIN!  Ugh.  It's like the PS3 has managed to take the worst aspects of PC and console gaming and rolled them all into one disappointing experience.

I have other devices that play Netflix but one reason I grabbed a PS3 was to have one for my other TV.  Added convenience, you know?  And the PS3 is #1 for Netflix.  But then I find out that if you want to play Netflix on PS3 you have to open a Sony Entertainment Network account.  This is not something they needed to do and giving Sony my personal information is not something I want to do seeing as how their security has been breached before and they tried to deny it for as long as they could.

The PS3 dashboard menu isn't user friendly either.  It looks very nondescript and has too much scrolling, making it hard to find what I'm looking for.  It sort of involves a series of menus that unfold into another series of menus, and if you highlight any of those they open up again into more menu options.  I think the idea behind it was to keep it all hidden but I always feel like I'm looking for my keys when I go through the PS3 system settings.  And does it have to ask me to connect to the internet every time I play a music CD?  No, I don't want to!  Quit asking me!  I still haven't discovered a way to check how much of my 250GB are free on the system.  Is there a way?

The system itself is a little noisy when reading discs but that sort of thing never bothers me.  It is also backward compatible with PSX games (so far my favorite feature).  It handles emulating them better than the PS2 did.  You don't need the memory cards or the old controllers to play them.  All you need is the PSX disc and your PS3.

If you agree with the below, feel free to copy/paste on other sites/boards.

Personally, I said ""take a hike, Blizzard"" by not buying Diablo 3. As a matter of fact, having been burnt by the horrible game of Star Wars: The Old Republic, I did not even buy Mass Effect 3 (I read gamers' reviews first and it turns out not buying it was a good decision) and, most certainly, I will never preorder ANY game (no matter how much I want to preorder X-COM: Enemy Unknown).

Over the last 5 years or so, game publishers have repeatedly lied to us, created incredible hype around their products, raised their prices to unbelievable, unprecedented levels and sold us TRASH... and WE bought said trash. It is time we all learned our lessons and collectively started doing a few things:

- Deliberately ignore all game advertisements as well as all pre-launch statements, comments, promises and previews by game developers or their puppets such as GameSpot (would GameSpot give D3 a bad preview/review when D3 ads paid by Activision/Blizzard are all over the GS site?);

- Never pre-order anything, ever; Just don't. Ever;

- Never buy ANY game until a couple of months have passed since launch date. Why? Not only because there may be some foolish, nave, trusting romantics who buy and review it before you but also because if no-one rushes to pay $70-80 for their (potentially trash) games, then in two months' time the price (in view of low demand) will have to drop to more reasonable levels of $40-50 or even less.

If we do this enough game publishers will have to change their unethical practices.

Video gaming (and especially computer gaming as opposed to console gaming) used to be a true art form and the games stimulated your mind and spirit.

The games of the last half decade have grown increasingly dumbed-down, streamlined, simplified, trivialized; they have turned into mainstream Hollywood assembly line of mass-produced garbage. Most of these games stimulate nothing but your mousing or button-mashing fingers and in the process insult your intelligence.

It is time to say to game publishers:

- We want OUR gaming back;
- You will not tell us what's good and force it down our throats until we like it;
- We will buy what we want and we refuse to buy what we DON'T want no matter how much YOU think we should like it;

It is time the gaming community stood up to the tyranny of Activisions, EAs and the like.

Good CGI: Or I should say, competent CGI. Nothing on the level of say, Squaresoft, but competent all-around. Nothing surprising there.

Excellent voicework: like prior games, great acting scenes are numerous here, although in many scenes the lines sort of fall flat. Again I must say that I was very disappointed in the story arc, which seemed to pay no attention to the tiny golden details of the first two games. About midway through the game I was left scratching my head at many inconsistencies and plotholes that were a result of obvious laziness on the part of Bioware devs.

Music is...competent. Nothing grand like Skyrim. It is sort of...""boopy"". If you're expecting something ""spacey"" like Michael Stearns or Steve Roach, forget it. Even Star Control II (3do) had better music.

The Bad:

The homo-sexual angle isn't just subtle like the former games I had played, but rather right in-your-face and had a dare-you-to-say-anything-about-it mentality about them. Is this a video game for kids, or adults? Is it a space opera or a game about gay politics? It was very distracting and had absolutely NO place in the Mass Effect universe. Totally depraved and irresponsible of Ray (CEO) to shove this into the game. I guess we now know what side of the aisle he is on.

Familiarity breeds...very familiar territory as you cut down swarms of stormtrooper-like cerebus troops, geth and cerebus engineers. However, this really started grinding on my nerves after playing for ten hours and seeing the same enemies time after time, much like Gears of War. What the combat lacks is variety of enemies, and some DEPTH to the environments, the kind Fallout 2 had. In short, it lacks a soul. I started to realize that it wasn't an RPG I was playing, but a FPS in the vein of Call of Duty or Gears of War, yet Bioware bills this as an RPG! That is a blatant lie. While I enjoy Gears of War...I know what to expect. The Gears of War devs don't bill their epic SHOOTER as anything other than a fps and not an rpg (and honestly, stealing the cover system from Gears of War was just silly).

Bioware has fallen. This isn't completely the fault of EA. After doing some research on who had played a big part in the creation of the greatest RPG of the 21st century, Baldurs Gate II, I learned that most of the guys that made *that* game have long since left Bioware for greener pastures. Still, Bioware had a duty to re-fill those positions with the brightest minds in the industry, and instead chose people who were experts not at creating absorbing rpg games, but rather those that are experts at creating mindless propaganda pieces, filled with cookie-cutter levels/enemies and ignoring the fans. It is as if NO ONE who worked on Mass Effect 1 had any input on this game. Perhaps the brass tossed the new designers a mass effect 1 disc and said ""here, have a look at this if you have time""?

Origin. Nothing more I can say that hasn't already been stated.

Minor Spoiler Alert:
And what exactly was the deal with stealing a picture off of the net (Tali)? Surely with a multi-million dollar budget, the developers could have done a better job at this?

I will never buy another Bioware game again. Ever.

If you didn't like draconian DRM schemes, you're going to hate UBI Soft's new policy: you must be connected to their servers 100% of the time to play Assasin's Creed 2. If you don't have internet, or if your internet is out, or if you are on vacation, stationed in Iraq, or want to play at the airport, you are out of luck. No game for you. That in itself is very troubling and reason enough to NOT BUY THIS GAME. However, there are additional reasons that are even more frightening:

1) Setting the precedent for future games

If gamers buy Assasin's Creed despite this huge limitation on game play, it will open the door to many more games like this in the future. That would be awful for the consumer.

2) Turning 'owning' into leasing""

Tying games to some sort of server for activation is bad enough, but making them DEPENDENT on a server is horrible for the consumer. It takes away our rights (to play the game we paid for on our terms) and creates a system whereby you are simply LEASING a game. If at some point UBI Soft decides to take down their servers, you lose your game. They can take away your rights to play the game at any point in the future if they decided to. They have you by the cajones! If you give into this model, expect to never own any digital medium again; the makers of games, producers of music, and distributors of movies would love to see our current model of OWNING a physical copy of your game \ album \ movie replaced with a system where you only own the 'right' to access \ play that medium. It's their wet-dream to turn the current system of ownership on its head so they can re-sell you things endlessly as well as take them away from you at their discretion. As a consumer, it's important that we speak out against this by supporting DRM free games (Mass Effect II, Dragon Age, Fallout III, etc...) and DRM free music (buy it from Amazon!) and REFUSE to buy this junk with built in limitations and restrictions that SERVE NO PURPOSE.

3) Making games dependent on 'phoning home' means you're at the total mercy of UBI Soft (or whomever runs their servers)

If their servers are down, you lose access to your game. If their servers are overtaxed, you may experience problems connecting to your game. Think that isn't likely? Think again. Currently (03/09/2010) the servers have been down for the last 12 hours or so, creating chaos for all those who expected to be able to fire up Assassin's Creed. It doesn't even matter if UBI Soft is malevolent or not; if your service provider has a bad week you may be out of luck. If there is a storm in your area, you could end up out of luck for weeks (this happened to me when a tree knocked out my cable internet for 9 says straight--I thought I was going to die). You're screwed if your internet, their servers, or anything along the line between the two goes down.

4) DRM is pointless (and this online restriction is one of it's worst forms!)

Want to pirate games? It's tragically easy these days. Even more tragic is that DRM, supposedly designed to prevent piracy, is a total failure at actually accomplishing that. Want proof? Google ""Spore + DRM + Piracy"" and see what you come up with. I'll give you a hint: Spore was pirated BEFORE it was officially released. Many games are unto torrent sites well before their release date. The worst part of this is that the pirated versions are in almost all cases SUPERIOR to the DRM infested versions: they don't contain the invasive, crippling, and destructive DRM that past games have been ruined by (Bioshock, Mass Effect I, Spore, etc...). I am NOT ADVOCATING PIRACY. I think you should buy the games you want to play. I am advocating NOT BUYING games that violate your basic consumer rights (right to resell your game, right to play your game WHENEVER you want to without restrictions). If a game limits those rights, I say skip it entirely. Because UBI SOFT are morons doesn't give anyone the right to steal. As your Mom (or at least mine) used to say: two wrongs don't make a right!

I am not opposed to simple DRM schemes (disk check, or even Steam which has established very good rapport gamers by being both consistent, fair, and show a long track record of stability). I am totally opposed to anything that PREVENTS ME FROM PLAYING THE GAME that I paid money for. I don't want to see this standardized (and I don't think it will be) and so it's time to take action NOW and refuse to buy this garbage.

The bottom line is DRM is not and has never been about preventing piracy. It's about CONTROL. Control over you and how you are able to play the very game you paid your money for. It's about wrenching ownership away from the consumer and replacing it with something much lesser: rental \ leasing. Don't let them do that to you.

Final Thoughts:

UBI SOFT and those like them have got to be taught a lesson. The only way to get heard by these huge companies is by hitting them where it hurts: their pocketbook. Refuse to buy this game or games like it that infringe on your rights. Tell your friends not to buy it. Write reviews that inform people about the risks of doing so. That's how you get things to change. To the inevitable trolls who will tell me that DRM should just be 'given in to,' I'd like to point out that currently game makers are MOVING AWAY from DRM schemes. The reason is because of the backlash against pointless restrictions by those like myself who are unwilling to sit around and watch PC gaming be ruined by greedy scumbags. It's because of grassroots action (Spore for example) that the tide has turned and that DRM is now much less common than it was a year ago. Top shelf games are being released DRM free. You know what? I've bought all of them and recommend you do the same. Let's all give our money to the makers of games that RESPECT us--after all, WE ARE THE CUSTOMERS.

You cant even play in single player mode without a Gold account.  There is also an ""always online"" requirement, you must be connected to the internet at ALL TIMES to play.  While I don't necessarily object to these requirements in theory, the problem is, the retail box DOES NOT MAKE THIS CLEAR ENOUGH!!  There are only 2 small boxes in the bottom left hand corner (lumped together with other misc ""boxes"") that mention this in small print.  Admittedly, it is there, but the print is so small that the average buyer isn't going to notice it when grabbing the game off the store shelf.  My young son (who was very excited to get this game) was very upset when we got home and the game refused to start without a Gold account.  It was only then that I took a very close look at the box and noticed the small print.  He was so upset that I went ahead and paid for a Gold membership so he could play.  I really felt like I got suckered into it.

The game has the rare good points, but overall, it was a waste of money.  I enjoy the walking dead series, the comics, and somewhat Telltale's game.

The game takes maybe five hours of game play to finish it.  Estimating the time is difficult because there is like a 4 minute load time every single time you die or have to stop for gas or supplies, and I also lost interest until I forced myself to play again.

The only interesting mechanic in the game is that there are no powered-up enemy/zombies.  Still, you can fight off one zombie easy enough.  Put two zombies together and the game makes fighting them stupid.  You have to continually push the zombies to stun them, but it only works with one at a time.

The mechanic is usually push the zombie, bash the zombie.  The number of bashes/slashes depends on the weapon equipped.  Use a gun, all kinds of zombies show up to kill you in no time.  The crossbow is cool.  Still, keeping track of the reusable crossbow bolts is a pain, and it comes in maybe the last level or two.

No internet connection, no online authentication, no proprietary game launchers. Just the game you bought and you. Bought this game for my wife and it is a damn nightmare to get it up and running. So many problems, I couldn't believe it. Let me break it down.

1. You need to set up an Origin account. This one isn't the worst, but I find it annoying that I need to create an EA login and password just to play a game I bought. I don't plan on using Origin for anything else, so this is definitely an inconvenience.

2. Origin constantly crashes. I tried installing this on my wife's computer, which is windows 10. Origin would crash a few seconds after launching so I tried a few things - restarted the PC, checked for any updates, checked drivers, uninstalled and reinstalled Origin. Nothing worked. Tried googling the problem and it seems to be a common occurrence - Origin does not play nice with windows 10. So I tried launching Origin through compatibility modes for Windows XP, Vista, 7, and 8. None of them were stable. They all crashed. Great. I then tried installing it on MY laptop, which is still windows 7 by default and after a few brief crashes, it finally loaded the store and let me type in the product code. THANK GOODNESS.

3. There is no way to install from the DVD that came with the game. When you insert the disc, an autolaunch window pops up telling you to install Origin, set up EA account, and then install Sims 4. Ok. I did the first two things....let me install Sims 4. But it won't. There are no options. If you click continue, it will just try to install Origin again. So you close it, pop the disc out, pop it in....and it loops the same prompts. Install Origin, Set up account...I GET IT. I already did those things. SO...I look through my Origin launcher for options. Nothing about installing from disc, only lets you download. Great. Now I gotta wait HOURS for this thing to download 10 gigs of data so I can play the game I ALREADY BOUGHT AND HAVE A DVD INSTALL DISC FOR. What a waste of time.

...did you notice?  The people responsible for the creation of the other two titles were Microsoft.  Dungeon Siege 1 and 2, both of which were phenomenal games, were made by different people.  Now, Microsoft often makes mistakes when it comes to games... it's true, they do.  In fact, they are quite low on my ""favorites"" list.  However, one thing they make sure to do is to stay away from the actual development of a game and they don't bother or influence the games ideas and creation.  Square Enix on the other hand has to make everything cutscene-happy, CG-intensive and storyline-exaggerated.

The characters and story in this game suck.  Beyond that, even.  The voice acting is annoying, the personalities are non-existent... there is nothing good here.  The problem with this is that you're STUCK with the buggers for a long time!  AND THEY TALK A LOT!  ABOUT NOTHING!

The gameplay is miserable, the combat is boring, they removed all the identifying factors out of this game that the original two had... it's just miserable.

I miss the open-world that the original had, seeing as this game sticks you with used gum to a small and tedious 1 lane highway track that constantly tells you to backtrack over and over and over to prolong your stay in the stupid, boring areas that don't contain any fun whatsoever.

Although the graphics have been revamped the environments and everything in the game world looks blurry and out of focus regardless of the HD or regular tv you may have. The draw-in distance is not very good either with lots of pop-ins and graphical glitches like a characters leg showing through solid objects (clipping).

There are also sound glitches which cut off an on abruptly at times. The music which is rather good, is very short and loops back endlessly, except that it doesn't have any musical transitions if it restarts again.

Voice acting is certainly better for the most part, but the character you control sounds like a sleezy porn star with a raspy voice.

The controls and in responsiveness of the character on screen is sluggish, you mash buttons wildly and see your character swinging the weapons in a limp fashion. Which brings be to the combat gameplay.

One button can be used to block attacks but it feels sluggish and unresponsive at times. You can dual wield weapons but the techniques look goofy and ineffective. You cannot lock-on to enemies during melee combat so a lot of times when you thought you had a solid hit, you actually end up slashing nothing.

The character animations still look sloppy, and they still move a bit stiff. The animations in Two World 2 lack the fluidity or any life-like movements found in many other open world RPGs.

Probably the only thing I really enjoyed in Two Worlds 2, is the crafting system which allowed me to create or repair weapons and clothing and magic spells. Also Liked how it allowed me to ""dismantle"" items and break them down into core elements such as metals, fabrics or potions.

The story was lackluster and tries to rip off the better Fable games. In TW2 main quest you have to rescue your sister from the evil Gandahar (incorrect spelling sorry). After the the boring and sloppy combat, blurry graphics and long list of glitches, I didn't care for TW2. The fanboys can attack me all they want but It won't change the facts that this tries to be a good RPG but fails on many fronts.

The first game sucked bad and I had high hopes that the improvements to this sequel would make me enjoy the game.
But this the second attempt which SouthPeak, and the developers fail to bring a good title. TW2 should be the final nail to coffin and hopefully this game gets buried or sold in the bargain bin.

Pros:
+multi-player game modes
+crafting system is easy and fun to use
+open world gameplay

Cons:

-glitches galore
-music and sound cuts off
-some of the voice-overs still suck
-blurry graphics
-sloppy controls
-sluggish response
-goofy animations
-goofy looking combat
-no lock on system
-navigation on maps an compass is not easy

The thing that really irks me is that some of the best games ever have been cartoony takes on sports. Like Punchout and Ready 2 Rumble for boxing fans and Mario Kart for racing fans, so on and so forth.
However if you want a wrestling title for your playstation, i recommend Smackdown 2, THQ did a great job with everything except the graphics on it, and the arenas look good, it smacks of fun and replay value.
If you want a good simpsons title, email the folks at Activision and tell them to make the Simpsons Racing game for GCN and PS2 not stink.",Seriously bad stuff...,996451200,4,,

The core mechanics make the game fun, the visuals and story make it compelling. Skyward Sword is what happens when you have one and not the other.

I have no beef with motion controls, I love Star Fox Zero and my Splatoon game got much better shortly after I switched to gyro aiming. But Skyward Sword feels like a game that was made for a traditional controller and shoehorned for the Wii. It's awkward and indirect. The swordplay was done well, it's pretty cool how some enemies and elements only respond correctly to being slashed in a particular direction, but everything else is a chore. It's a constant nag that, no, you can't do this the way that feels natural.

I came in expecting a learning curve, but this is a mess. It's the only major Zelda title I hadn't played and I hoped to do so before Breath of the Wild, but I think I'll wait for an HD remake.

On that note, too, the visuals are strangely fuzzy. I played Twilight Princess on the Gamecube and thought it was beautiful, so I'm not sure why they made it look this way. I realize graphical complaints are usually a moot point for Nintendo titles, but this is one case where it would have looked better if they'd just done less.

I'm sure the game has excellent content. I played it up to the first dungeon before deciding that it's too much of a chore to play to be enjoyable.","Surprisingly disappointed, disappointingly surprised",1484956800,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

1.0,False,"11 6, 2010",ARJ2L3J5GPHRM,B004774IPU,LittleTazz,"First, I have not purchased this game and won't until it is STEAM free. This game is wrapped with STEAM so STEAM is a legitimate issue, even if it is the only issue.

Now .. . . I've read virtually all the reviews of this product and have some things I want to say:

1) STEAM is not a product protection service, and does not discourage piracy. As most of you know, anyone can download a pirated copy of any popular game in a matter of days.
2) STEAM serves no purpose other than being a marketing platform for products. Sure, ya don't have to care for a DVD if ya download a game and ya have to keep your key . . . big deal. And ya, it may be convenient to find your friends to play an online game with, and various other small time benefits to make users feel they are getting something great by having STEAM on their computer . . . but . . .
3) WindowsBlowUp is hard enough to keep working properly without some resource hog that can't be controlled starting up, as if WindowsBlowsUp doesn't have enough unnecessary processes already.
4) STEAM is a horrible security risk. To see a discussion of this go to []. BTW, I would not be surprised in the least if STEAM had already been compromised. Buy a good book on computer forensics. The stories of companies getting hacked, getting their files stolen, paying a ransom, and NOT reporting it to stockholders let alone the public is stunning.
5) Programmers are notorious for leaving backdoors in programs. If ya don't know what a backdoor is, or are skeptical go to this link -[], and you will see how vulnerable computer users are.
6) STEAM server is secure? Think again. It takes one skilled system wise programmer working in the STEAM server installation to download all the customer information onto a portable device and sell it to the highest bidder.
7) Some reviews and comment talk about the ""ethical"" and ""moral"" character and responsibility of corporations. Hogwash! Enron had an corporate ""ethics"" policy too! Remember Enron? If not look it up. I worked for years in business and there is only a couple rules companies (most of them) follow. Executives focus on personal advancement above all else, and the corporation will do whatever it takes to ensure its continued existence, and growth and will exterminate any threat if possible using whatever means it thinks it can get away with. Profit IS everything!
8) Anyone who thinks that STEAM is concerned about individual user satisfaction is delusional. STEAM is concerned only by numbers and statistics. Really . . . if STEAM was concerned about user experience, there would be a check box which gave the consumer the ability to completely disable STEAM until the time the consumer wanted to connect to get the patches or look at products available.
9) I predict that when STEAM (if and/or when they do) gets a market share that is great enough to monopolize the gaming market, they will increase the price of the product, charge for the service, etc.
10) I use as an example MicrosoftBlowsUp as an example. As an operating system it sucks donkey balls and is way over priced. Ubuntu is way better and free too. Any program you want is available for FREE. Every driver you could ever want is included as a loadable module so ya don't have to install drivers for your printer, or any other peripheral you use. Never defrag, no corrupt registry or files, secure, and fast. MicrosoftBlowsUp has used every trick it can to maximize its profits and extinguish any competition to the detriment of the consumer. STEAM will do exactly the same thing IF it gains enough market share. That's why I dumped my PC's and just spent $4000 buying two MacBook Pro's.
11) I've had multiple STEAM accounts ""restricted"" for who know what reason, have had download times that were in the 12 - 20 hour range for game data, STEAM not available so I can't play my game, and others report corrupt files, game patches being installed that make game saves obsolete, support only through e-mails and very slow too. Go to the STEAM forums to find all the complains of service, or days of non-service. Lets not forget the pop-up ads. For those with bandwidth limitations this uncontrollable service can be a killer and can put the user over their limit with sometimes extremely costly over-usage charges.
12) Let me list just some of the problems STEAM causes the consumer (all these comments come from 1 star reviews):
  ""I have a rather stingy 450MB daily download limit so it REALLY pisses me off that a friggin' video game publisher would presume to waste my bandwidth with an always on connection and download updates uncontrollably.""
  ""At present, I have been waiting for two hours for Civ V to load, for it's been trying to install an update for that period.""
  ""[STEAM] . .. is intrusive and a waste of system resources.""
  ""I've written repeated e-mails to Steam support and 2K Games and get the automated response that I will be contacted within 72 hours. I never am contacted.""
  ""I have yet to have a game that is attached to STEAM that doesnt crash. Left for Dead 2? yup crashes CONSTANTLY, if not on my end then ineveitably someone I am playing with crashes. Half life? Yup there too.""
  ""Also, if your internet connection hiccups, the game connection is lost, and everything locks up.""
  "" . . . the install process forces the user to install stream and the updates, which requires about nine hours of time.""
  "" . . . steam spyware would not let me play the first evening because the 'servers were overloaded'""
  ""On a final note: Steam? Really? Took about 2 hours to get past the ""our servers are too busy"" message.""

  So now equal time to the STEAM fanboy's. Virtually all these quotes come from 4 and 5 star reviews:
  ""Steam support is responsive and has handled easy questions well.""
  ""Steam represents nothing more than a large part of the reason that PC gaming is still alive and well today.""

  ""I don't have a problem with Steam since I use it for other games but this really irritates me.""

And finally another happy consumer (rating the game as 3 stars):
  ""I agree with everyone else who said ""STEAM SUCKS"". It's okay, actually, for download-only games... I don't mind it. I also don't mind the activation scheme. What I do mind is how much it degrades the initial and very important installation experience, and how you have to run steam to run the game -- I hate that! You screw up the install process and you put the user in a really bad mood right away -- not good.

It took me thirty minutes of watching steam say ""Checking file 1 of 1"" and two restarts of the installation to figure out that it was, in the background, downloading a 4.6GB update for Civ IV, along with 2 other updates totalling 2.0GB!!!! AND IT NEVER EVEN TOLD ME!

1.  A roleplaying game, which consists of walking around and asking people things.  However you generally ask each person one thing, and they give you one response, so there's not much room for thinking.
2.  A naval simulator, which is mildly interesting for the first couple of fights.  However, since every fight is basically the same, this quickly becomes boring-- endlessly sailing in circles and lining up broadsides against your opponents.
3.  A video game style fencing sequence that is simply annoying.  It's ridiculously primitive compared to the martial arts style games on the market, and one has to wonder why it's even in here.
Over all, there was nothing particularly compelling about the game play.  The graphics are pretty, but how long can you stare at the waves and the storm clouds when the game itself is dry as toast?

1. No split screen, so you can't play with a buddy on the couch.  Your buddy has to be on his couch, at his house, and have his own copy, or you have to set up a LAN just to play this game, and he still has to buy his own copy.

2. From the time you load the game to the time you actually play, 12 MINUTES transpire.  That's right, 12 MINUTES.  This is because:

 * the game holds up and forces you to enter a code contained inside the jewel case to ""receive your online pass"".  You have the option to either enter the 16 digit code, or go through a process to receive a ""free 2 day pass"".  Both seem to be equally time consuming.

 * Following that nuisance, there is an UNSKIPPABLE 3 MINUTE TRAILER for another EA game that is yet to be released.  UNSKIPPABLE.

 * Following THAT, there is a lengthy in-engine trailer with an ""AutoLog"" logo on the screen ""driving"" down a deserted road while a woman's voice tells you how great AutoLog, EA's online ""service"" for all their latest driving games, is.  This goes on for 2 minutes.

 * Following THAT, the game menu finally appears, but wait!  The options appear on the screen ONE AT A TIME, while the same woman's voice gives you a 90 second explanation for EACH MENU ITEM.  This, like everything so far, IS UNSKIPPABLE.

3. Once you finally get into the game, all the cut scenes are unskippable.  Unlocked a new car?  Unskippable, because it's basically an ad, and you HAVE to see it, probably because the manufacturer paid to force you to see it.  Explaining how the ranking system works for racers?  Unskippable!  The ranking system tutorial video for cops?  Unskippable!  The track flyover at the beginning of each race? ...SKIPPABLE!!  HALLELUJAH!!  THE *ONLY* CUT-SCENE YOU CAN SKIP IN THE **ENTIRE** GAME.

A lot of complaints surrounding this remote are totally valid but I still found the remote to be fairly decent and it does have some redeeming qualities.

The Bad:
(-) Overall I don't particularly like the form factor of the remote. It's much smaller than the PS3 BT remote control that came before it and as a result many of the buttons are tiny. In particular the PS4 face buttons are tiny and poorly positioned making them difficult to use.

(-) For a remote with such small keys you'd think there would be a backlighting feature. But no such luck. Finding extra small keys in a darkened room while watching a movie sucks.

(-) The remote is missing buttons you'd expect to have. None of the shoulder buttons (L1, R1, etc) get a button.

(-) Much like the PS3 BT remote if PS4 is the selected device on this remote any button acts like a power button and turns on the PS4.

(-) Batteries (2x AAA) are not included.

The Good:
(+) I do like the button click when a button is pressed. It's much more tactile than on the PS3 BT remote.

(+) Volume Punch-through is very easy to setup and controls the volume on the TV (a Panasonic plasma in my case) even when another device is selected (e.g. PS4).

(+) Setting up the universal control features was pretty easy - either by manually inputting remote codes or using the learning feature (covered in the included instructions).

UPDATE 11/17/2015:
--------------------
I've had the chance to use the PS4 Universal Remote more and more with my PS4, mainly using Netflix and Amazon VOD, and now I'm understanding the hate this remote gets. So two major issues have cropped up and unless there's a dramatic turnaround I'm probably going to scrap this remote altogether. Also, changing my review from 3 to 1-star.

Issue #1: BT Connectivity -
After initially working without issues my remote now seemingly cannot stay paired. The remote seems to enter rest-mode but has trouble waking. I end up having to push random buttons in the hopes of finally getting the remote to wake and work.

Issue #2: Battery Drain -
I'm on my second pair of brand new AAA batteries. The last pair of fresh batteries was put in the remote and less than 24-hrs later the remote (through the PS4) reported that it was low on battery power.",Some Good Some Bad With This Remote - Updated 11/17/15,1446508800,,,

First, during installation, it locked up my computer (XP Pro, fully-updated) twice (big red button time).  The first time was on the 4th (out of 4) CDs.  To work around that, I copied all four CDs to my hard drive and installed from there.  That led to my second lockup.  While merely copying the files to my hard drive, XP locked up again.  After that hard boot, I was able to get all the files copied and installed.  But, that second lockup leads me to suspect the problem was with the CDs themselves.

My second problem was an incompatibility with my Microsoft Wireless Laser Mouse 6000.  During the initial tutorial, the game goes through a section on panning the view using the middle mouse button.  The tutorial simply wouldn't recognize my mouse's middle button clicks.  After searching the web, I found that people with the Logitech MX 1000 (amongst others) had the same problem.  The solution was to use their mouse software to change the default middle mouse button to Autoscroll or middle-click.  For some reason, doing the same with my Microsoft Wireless Laser Mouse 6000 software didn't work.  At that point, I just said ""to heck (hah) with it"" and uninstalled the game.  My son tells me that when he played the game, he had the same problem with his Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer.  He worked around it by changing the options in the game to use the SHIFT key instead of the middle mouse button.

It's not much of a review, but hopefully, it might help others who are running into similar problems and are willing to fight with the game more than I was.  I rate this game at 1 star out of 5.",Didn't Recognize my Middle Mouse Button,1138233600,6,,

Granted they have since seen the error and released an adapter and a new controller that has a standard jack.  However, I already own four controllers and do not want to replace them in order to get one that has a jack.

As for the alternatives, they have issues.  When in game/party chat you can tell if someone is using a headset connected to one of these other options as it will either produce echo or a ring within the party that everyone but the user producing it can hear.

Finally, I could live with the proprietary connection, if the product provided was a quality product.  This product is poorly made with the thinnest possible wire, which breaks easily.  I am now on my third headset and have done nothing with them that was abnormal.  Infact I did purchase one of the adapters, which comes with a dongle to connect a standard 2.5mm headset, that dongle made with the same wire as the headset also failed.  leaving me without a headset again.  I suspect that dongle was responsible for much of the in party noise.

Many would argue that I should get turtle beach headset.  Those users are not enjoying the true sound capabilities of games mastered in 5.1 and 7.1.  Even ""Surround"" headphones cannot compare with a true surround system.  A 2.5cm speaker cannot compete with a 15"" 1000watt subwoofer for producing base.  And even a few micro drivers baked into a head set cannot truly emmulate surround sound.  I use a 7.1 setup with Pioneer Elite Amp and Klipsch Reference speakers.  Why would I want to give that up to listen through a pair of headphones that mess with the audio balance in favor of amplifying footsteps instead of providing a well rounded audio experience?

Besides seeing the classic wrestlers in the game none of the characters can perform any of their trademark moves.  Each character uses the same move set and the action gets boring very quickly.  The play control on this game is really terrible.  The game seems light years behind WWF Royal Rumble that was a great game on the SNES.  The lack of game mode options 3 and the only 8 characters hurt the game.  Ultimately there is very little replay value to the game.  Whereas WWF RR and RAW both have the Royal Rumble option that is fun to play even today.  Those games had a ton of replay value especially playing against friends.  Whereas this game just makes you want to break the TV set or bang your head against a wall.

LJN seems like the king of making crappy games and this one is no exception.  I remember this game getting a Nintendo Power cover and a lot of publicity, but the game itself is awful.  Not having the signature moves is a huge drawback to the game.  Even if you did not have all the play options not having the moves is the downfall of the game.

Don't waste your time playing it, play the much improved RR SNES game instead it is a lot more fun even if it did not have the Hulkster.  Wrestling games have come a long way from this primitive additions, but there was potential to make these games great.  WWF Super WrestleMania just misses the mark.

I loved Mirror's Edge, and the thought of a customizable class-based team shooter with Mirror's Edge-like movement sounded amazing. But I'm not unrealistic - I'm a game developer, and I know how hard a trick that is to pull off. Brink not only fails on the high concept, though - it fails at just about everything else.

The entire structure of the single player campaign is basically a giant botmatch, with some of the stupidest AI ever seen in a commercially-released game. Entire missions can be spent shooting down a single hallway, mowing down enemies for 20 straight minutes until the time finally runs out. The weapon customization is extensive, yet totally pointless. The character customization is gorgeous (the one thing they really did do right), but the underlying class-based nature of the game means that the customizable characters actually work against clarity of gameplay.

More, the class-based nature of the game is horrendously structured - honestly, one of the worst designs I've seen in any game, ever. You can improve your class, but in most games, you'll need to switch constantly from one class to another. So if you want to specialize as an Engineer... FORGET IT. Your team will be completely screwed when a non-Engineer-related challenge comes up.

Worst of all, the much-vaunted parkour system is almost utterly pointless. The level design is such that half the time you can't tell whether you can make a jump, there's not enough visual feedback to determine what you'll actually do as you run forward, and you'll often get ""stuck"" on obstacles you wanted to just run by.

Brink is full of bad design decisions, awful AI, boring weapons, lousy controls, and mindnumbingly poor gameplay. It's a joyless, fun-free mess, and a complete waste of time.

I'll make this short, because I think some people need to know just how flipping boring this game is. The dialogue is okay. You have to read it, and there is no actual speach. I can live with that, especially since this game did come out a few years back.

However, the action sequences are left the game found wanting. You press a button, and watch your characters do all the work. ""Wow. That's it?!"" Is what I thought to myself. I'm not much of an RPG guy, but when I hear the words ""ACTION"" and ""FUN TO PLAY"" associated with it, I tend to think their might be some challenging action scenes to go along with a game with story line.

Where I am located the game is unplayable. And, in this case, location does have an impact on whether or not you will be able to play Diablo. I think Blizzard underestimated the sheer volume of fans they have that live in an area where extremely fast, stable and unlimited internet is unavailable.

I have internet through mobile broadband and while it is OK for surfing it is not fast enough to play online games. I knew this before I bought the game but hoped that Diablo 3 would just use a connection to validate your character and then play as a normal game off your hard drive etc. but this was not the case. Even when playing single player the online aspect of the game is so entwined into the game itself that I was unable to play with my current internet setup.

Another problem is the lack of support for some common video cards. I understand a new game will not run on all systems and that even after a few years your PC maybe be falling slightly behind unless you upgrade but I have an Alienware for Christ's sake. It maybe be one of the cheaper models (M11X) but until Diablo 3 I had not tried to play a single game that my system would not run, this includes recent titles like Dead Island which I played with maxed out graphics for hours with no frame rate issues at all. Even when I took my PC to a location that had fast internet I was still unable to play at any more than 4-5 frames a second (with graphics and resolution all the way down) and my system is overclocked.

My video card was not only in the not recommended list but the completely unsupported list. I guess I should have researched that before hand but I never dreamed my computer would not run a game like this. I had to add a (-launch) command to the exe and change a few numbers in the instillation file to even get past the games graphic card filter to attempt to play it (there is a guide online for this). I bought my copy from Walmart which means I can not return it. It makes me mad that Blizzard would block some users from even trying to play the game they purchased especially for those of us who can not return it.

I activated a new internet service with a slightly better ping which was the best I could do in my area but was unable to log on for most of the entire day due to the servers being overloaded. Even after the launch day storm is over, and even if I could play the game, I would not appreciate having to rely on servers to play a game that I purchased.

I always loved the first two games because I could play them offline but forcing players to have an internet connection is a bad choice and I think Blizzard will lose many fans over it. The best I can do now is wait a few years until I have the money and actually need a new system since I can't upgrade the graphics card in my model and hope someone hacks it and releases a patch of sorts to allow offline play. Funny, if you think about it, the choice to force players to connect to the internet in hopes of preventing people from altering the game in anyway may promote people to do just that.",Not what I was hopping for.,1337299200,23,{'Format:': ' Computer Game'},

I'm sure Sony had some reasoning (other than money) to create and market this thing.  The carpeting thing as many people mentioned is one, but I don't see why anyone would do that in the first place.  I think it even says in the PS2 instructions not to place it on carpet.

Circulation - don't put your PS2 on carpet, under water, buried in dirt, or anywhere near your little brother's Pokemon toys.  Raises the gaming unit - try putting it up on blocks as one reviewer suggested, or if you like get a car jack and just raise the thing and lower it to your preference.  Stabilizes - I could go into a fifteen paragraph tangent about that one but I wont.  You all know what I would say.  Sleek design and looks cool - if you're worried about your PS2's looks, you probably have more issues than a horizontal stand can fix.

I reviewed the vertical stand too, and I basically said the same thing.  I don't own either, and I have no plans to buy them.  I think it's just a way for Sony to rip people off.  No other game system needs something like this, and I'm sure the next generation Playstation won't need it either.

When Game Informer magazine gets ahold of this, I'm predicting they give it a 2 out of 10. And that's being generous. Where to begin?

There's a semblance of fun when you pick your crew and the kid says, ""Capt, I've got a girl in my bunk and my girlfriends headed this way, can you stall her?"" You can either help or not. What you decided to do has absolutely ZERO influence in the game. The question itself gives you hope that there's interaction and decisions to be made in the game....WRONG.  After that, the game spirals down to the most BORING game ever created quickly. And, yes, I am a fan of the TV show so the disappointment is magnified.

So you pick your boat, slap your own name on it, and paint it to your liking. That sounds like a big thing but it really isn't as you hardly ever pan around to the front of the boat (no need to) to see your custom name.

OK, back to picking your crew. First off, it's a short list and you can't create your own. I picked my crew and before I even dropped my first pot, the girl gave herself a hernia. The appointed ""medic"" gives me the report that ""He's got a hernia, we should probably drop him off next time we're in port."" HE'S got a hernia?! Huh?!

Moving on, you only have 1 question for the crew ""How are you doing?"" and they've only got 1 response ""Doing great!"" Occasionally as they begin to get tired they'll give you 1 or 2 complaints like ""I need a break"" or ""You can't work with cold hands."" But that's it, there's absolutely no real-time interaction. There's also ZERO interaction down in the galley. As in, you tell someone to cook a meal and they disappear off the deck. Why couldn't they have made an achievement around cooking a meal on the rocking boat? You're either in the boat house or looking down on the deck. There's nothing in between.

You can call the other ships in the area. Again, only 1 question. ""How's the fishing?"" They'll give you 1 of 3 answers. Again, whatever response they give - or you give them when they call you - has ZERO influence in the game.

You can call the Coast Guard with only 1 question - I need a tow. What happened to the Coast Guard helping with injured crew members?

As for piloting the boat, it takes - literally - 5 minutes to go a few hundred yards, you'll get a taste of this on the VERY FIRST thing you do which is to pilot your boat in a straight line into port. Who considers this riveting fun???

It almost feels like you're playing the game in REAL TIME. It's is AGONIZINGLY SLOW. You decide to drop a pot: The crane picks up a pot, swings it around, lowers it to the deck. The guy unhooks the cable and takes out the buoys. Another guy crawls in with the bait then closes the latch. This whole exchange takes a minute or more. You have to do this over and over and over again - all the while to the sound of loud seagulls. No dialogue on deck, no music, just the sound of seagulls. Eventually you'll come back to pick up the pots. ZERO response from the crew when the pot if full. ZERO response from the crew when the pot is empty. You may get a dialogue box to pop up where a guy says, ""I hope they're all like this"" but that's it. There's ZERO animation. And the crab itself? 2-D??? What happened to technology in the 21st century??? It's embarrassing. The crab comes out of the pot in 2 Dimension then slowly melts away.

It took all my patience and then some to go through a season of King and a season of Opillio fishing just so I could say I gave the game a chance. It doesn't eventually get better.

And I've been playing strategy games for 20 years (starting with Link & Final Fantasy for the Nintendo - more recently playing the demo for Sid Meier's Civ Revolution which is EXTREMELY fun). This game is hardly a strategy game, it's a game with so many shortcomings - so many opportunities to make it good but they didn't - it's a total flop.

Essentially what you are buying is an updated version of the original game with better graphics - nothing more. The online multiplayer utilizes the ""Halo: Reach"" engine, but includes maps from ""Halo: CE"".

Their excuses for this:

1) ""We didn't want to split up the reach community!""
Bizarre logic. Should we expect that for H4? Sorry guys, no H4 multiplayer - wouldn't want to split up the Reach community! Just imagine if COD used that logic. You buy Modern Warfare 3, only to find out that online multiplayer is Black Ops. What brilliance! Point being, everyone wanted online multiplayer for CE. Even the people that criticize us for being pissed off admit they would of liked to have seen multiplayer for CE.

2) ""We would have had to ship on 2 discs!""
Would you buy a 2 disc game for the ability to play online multiplayer? There's your answer to this excuse.

Answers to people criticizing my review:

1) ""You should have read the box!""
A) It's not a box, it's a case.
B) This is Amazon.com - not Wal-Mart. There is no ""box"" to look at. Nowhere in this page's product description does it say it utilizes the Halo: Reach engine.
C) I didn't buy the game, knowing months before that it didn't include online multiplayer. I created a petition on Change as well as the Waypoint forums to bring multiplayer back. I don't know why you genius's assume because I'm complaining about there not being multiplayer, that apparently means I thought there was. I want multiplayer on the game whether or not I thought it was going to have it or not - duh!
D) Go heckle people walking out of Target and Wal-Mart. Go chill inside of Gamestop and right after someone buys the game you can start yelling ""SHOULDA READ THE BOX, DERRR"". Who does that anyways? Is it common for games that have the xbox live strip, to be a different xbox live game? Besides ODST, this is the only game I know of that utilizes a completely different game's online portion. Do you really expect people to go on a treasure hunt on the back of the box to question what should already be assumed?

I had by then become a devotee of the next newer version - FS2002. While aCoF obviously surpasses FS-2002 on a frame-by-frame basis, comparitive frame-rate more than evened things out for the older game. I knew that the minimum system requirements were conservative, but nothing prepared me for how conservative they were. Despite only ""requiring"" a 450mhz-class CPU & 128mb of RAM, aCoF ran like a slide-show on my 2.2 Ghz Pentium 4, w 512 MB of RAM, with GeForce graphics acceleration - and that was with options sliders set to 0 or near it. Apparently, software manufacturers like MS believe that they're past the days of having to set the minimum sys-req at half the optimum - now we have to multiply by five to get an honest idea of what's really needed. Though a better graphics accelerator and more RAM, would improve things, personally I'm happy enough with FS2002, and that program looks to have a more permanent place on my PC.",Not a review - a warning,1091664000,17,,

Here were some of my biggest issues with the system (and by that I mean the console, Microsoft, and gaming companies):

1. I'm required to be on the Internet.
So basically I have to buy the system and have internet for it to even work. The original I could play even if the internet went down, now not so much.

2. Required to have Xbox Live.
Now this isn't a requirement for all games but a lot being manufactured these days require you to have Xbox Live to do anything more than the tutorials. Xbox Live $60 a year plus, $60 for a games = $120 to really get anything out of it.

3. Updates and game installation.
Seemed like any time I turned the system for the first week I would wait 15min for the it to update. On top of that I had to install the game on my system which took around 30 min. Plus once the game was installed and I find out I didn't like it, sorry no returns since the games can only be installed once.

I don't know if it's me not catching up with the times but it seems like games and consoles have gotten way over priced and you can share games like we used to. On top of that we have to now pay a membership fee to even use the games we ALREADY BOUGHT. This all seems like one big marketing ploy to me.

However, after writing the review, I uninstalled the game. I had to separately uninstall Exorcist II and three demo downloads, plus I uninstalled a program called Screensaver News. I'm playing on a PC, so I did this through the ""Add or Remove"" list under ""My Computer"" under START.

After all the un-installing, though, I was surprised to see I still had two icons on my desktop. Usually when you delete a game, the icon disappears, too.

The remaining icons are called Exorcist II and Game Center. These are still full programs. If I click on the Exorcist II icon, I can start and play a new game. If I click on Game Center, I still get the pop-up to play and/or register for the three demos, and I can still play the demos. I can delete the icons, but that doesn't delete the programs.

In other words, Viva Media and Microsoft have installed .exe programs on my computer that I cannot uninstall with the Add or Remove Programs process.  They are not the only company that does this. I do not know for sure, but in the prior case I've seen, the exe programs are actually set up to report from your computer periodically.  This really makes me angry. I have to ask someone to help me go into the program files to delete these programs, as I'm not computer savvy enough to be sure and do it right myself.
These are the icon properties:
Icon #1:
target:
""C:\Program Files\SCREENSEVEN\Exorcist2CD\Exorcist2_og.exe""
start in:
""C:\Program Files\SCREENSEVEN\Exorcist2CD\""

Icon #2:
target:
""C:\Program Files\OXXOGames\VIVAGplayer\GPlayer.exe""
start in:
""C:\Program Files\OXXOGames\VIVAGplayer\""

When I buy a CD ROM game, I should not have my computer invaded - at least that's what it feels like to me.

I would appreciate the help, if someone can tell me why I cannot delete these game files via the usual Add or Remove Programs application; I'd appreciate elucidation. I read the previous one-star reviewer who mentioned the pop-up before I bought ""Exorcist II"", but I didn't realize that the problem went beyond a pop-up.

In the meanwhile, I'm not buying any more Viva Media or Microsoft games.

//////////////////////////

Original Title for my review: Good Gameplay, though a little short, Nasty Pop-Up Ad

""Call me Jacob"" - you are Jacob, an untested exorcist. Your first task is to rid the church of Pastor Hoff from its demon infestation. When you're done, you notice a huge house in the distance. You are delighted that it is the home of Garret Ghostfighter, your exorcist mentor. But horrors, when you go to the house, you find out from Barrymore, the faithful butler, that Garret has been frozen by a curse put on him by the demon Belphegor.

Or, wait a minute, is Barrymore faithful? Why didn't he recognize you?  Your will find out as you work to free Garret.

""The Exorcist II"" is a combination game, with 8 hidden object (HO) screens, 18 puzzles and many many inventory objectives.  Compared to the great combination games, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mystery-Case-Files-Return-to-Ravenhearst/dp/B001Q54VVC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mystery Case Files: Return to Ravenhearst</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mystery-Case-Files-Dire-Grove/dp/B00337WN34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mystery Case Files: Dire Grove</a>, it is a little short as well as a bit easier.

When you start a game, you have three levels to chose from: Casual (hints recharge quickly, puzzles can be skipped and active zones sparkle for easier identification), Expert (hints recharge more slowly, puzzles can be skipped and no active zone sparkling) or Professional (no hints, no skipping puzzles, no sparkles).  I played at the Professional level, and it was still easier than the two five-star rated games I mention above. But ""Exorcist II"" is still a very fun game. The puzzles are varied and range from easy to medium difficulty. As are the inventory objectives. Even at the Professional level, you're given hints in Jacob's musings. Such as when you click on a broken coffee grinder and Jacob thinks (spoken as well as captioned), ""I need to find a handle"".

The story line is cliche, but it doesn't take itself seriously, so it's just fun. There's goofy dialogue like, ""You filthy humans and your disgusting emotions!""  Dialogue like that and the accompanying music have kind of a 50's horror film feel. The voice acting is annoying, though, definitely not the game's strong point.

There is never any need to take notes, because information is kept in Jacob's journal for your reference.

I played on a PC XP with no problem. The first time I installed the game, it took an inordinate amount of time. I think that's because of all the extra crap that is installed, such as the demos for three other games. In addition, the next day I got a pop-up screen alerting me to the next great game download I might want to buy. I buy the DVD's of games so I don't get the spam, and I think it's a dirty trick for Microsoft and Viva Entertainment to force spam on me.

I was about an hour into the game when I received the pop-up. I uninstalled ""Exorcist II"". You cannot uninstall just the demos or ""game center"", they are a package deal.

Then I re-installed. Though I still had the demos loaded with the re-install, I at least did not get any more pop-ups.  When I checked my ""Add or Remove Programs"" list, one of the items is called ""Screensaver News"". I think this might be the pop-up application.

I thought ""Exorcist II"" was a fun lively game, accessible to all ability levels.

I had been wanting this game for awhile now and finally bought it only to be kept from gameplay by Steam Works/Valve. I know this is a good game because I bought and played the first one endlessly it was so great. But Monolith totally destroyed their product by partnering with Steam/Valve. First, Steam wants you to go on-line just to play so you go on-line. Then it says its going to update the game whether you want to update it right then or not. When it supposedly starts the update it gives you no indication of just how big the update is. It could be 5 Megs or 5 Gigs for all we know. Meanwhile, they bombard you with ads for other games eating up bandwidth as you're trying to download the update. The Steam software supposedly gives you the option to play offline but when you tell it reload in offline mode it just seems to hang up will running your cpu at 100% even after you've exited the software in frustration. You have to go to the task manager and end the process in order to shut the thing down. I'm ticked off at Amazon as well as Monolith over this. There is no way Amazon should allow it's customers to be subject to such a horrible experience as the one you will experience with software bundled with Steam. It reflects badly on Amazon. The very least they could do is post a warning to the customer. And what was Monolith thinking? Certainly not about the gamer. Pirating is not destroying gaming, the game makers themselves are destroying gaming by allowing ridiculous schemes such as this to be bundled with their products.

Man, was I totally wrong.

Everything about this game is worthless after the intro movie. The single player campaign was so easy, I finished it in one night. There was absolutely no challenge to it at all. And this was on the highest level of difficulty.

I have no interest in multiplayer online, so I will not speak of it. (Nor will I talk about how much Steam and GfW Live suck - read other reviews for that). However, the game's 'skirmish' mode is also a total joke, with so many things wrong. First off - four factions? What happened to the Chaos Space Marines? The Tau? The Necrons? Sisters of Battle? Dark Eldar? Yes, they introduced a 'new' race (finally!), but none of the others before it? Very bad move.

And as for the game play... completely screwed up. You build an army and go. Big deal! What happened to building defenses, various buildings and upgrades, using each to decide how to go forward as you play? ""Nope, can't do that... have to make things more streamlined and make the play flow faster."" Well screw that! I like building up a certain way, THEN going to get the enemy. This way is entirely no fun whatsoever.

If I could, I would seriously give DoW II a rating of Zero. That is how disappointed I am in this thing. So it will sit on my hard drive and remain idle while I go back to playing Dark Crusade and Soulstorm.

Why they feel that will slow down a game cracker, and why they don't mind blowing off an entire segment of the market, is entirely beyond me, but that's not the point here.  Call UBI Soft tech support BEFORE buying this or any other PC game from them, and check to make sure whether or not you will be able to install.  Software (such as Chessmaster 9000, to grab a random UBI product as an example) doesn't come with a warning on the box (in ""some"" cases, they claim -- I haven't found a single box that does), nor is there a warning on the Amazon product pages (short of reviews like this).  One could speculate that they're perfectly happy to let people buy their software knowing some won't be able to install it, but I'll leave their motivation to give no warning to consumers to your imagination.
UBI Soft's tech support has said that this ""feature"" extends to *all* of their PC titles.  So fair warning, particularly to folks with laptops where DVD/CDRW drives came standard, ask before you buy.  Perhaps if enough people have a problem with this flawed policy, UBI will smarten up.  ""Flawed"" because limiting installs to drives without write capacity isn't going to slow a determined game cracker/pirate down, it's only going to prevent normal consumers from being able to install the game.  Worse, they don't find out until they've opened the package and tried to install, which in some cases is enough to prevent a return and refund from the seller.

And FFX is just that. A movie with limited (and I mean LIMITED) player interaction, on a level with the horrible Xenogears. There are NO camera angle changes, and no 360 degree control. The game is TOTALLY and completely linear. You spend the first two hours watching young Tidus, a supposedly great blitzball player, whine and whimper about `his old man' disappearing when he was young. Not only is the voice over emotionally inconsistant, the pitch is irritable. AND YOU CANNOT X-MASH THROUGH THE SCENES! The `game' is in complete control thoughout. The plot is entangled (and I mean in knots) with religious conflict and political manipulation, the intricacies of which, as an adult, I understood and enjoyed. As a teen, I wouldn't tolerate it, and would be horrified when I found YOU CANNOT BYPASS A SINGLE SCENE THROUGHOUT THE GAME. While most of the backdrops are graphically superior, there is little exploration allowed. Your characters run only only on paths in area scenes, and there is NO world scene, and no control over destination. You only go where the game sends you. (I have 30 hours in, I hope it changes...)
But there are some redeeming factors here. If you don't mind watching another `Final Fantasy: Spirits Within' movie, you are in luck. The computer graphics are absolutely breathtaking. As far as ganes go, FFX is the CG feather in Square's cap,  especially the ocean scenes involving Sin, the mega-whale sized creature bent on destruction. I have never seen creatures and water displayed with such realism. On land, the trees sway, and I wish Square had invested as much time in the gameplay as they did making everyone's hair move in the breeze. The voice-overs were a step up in reading text after text after text (I turned the text off and just listened...)The battle scenes are copied from FFIX with a few graphic enhancements. The `sphere' grid' is a new way of powering up and learning spells, and is the most amusing part of the game. Weapons do not get stronger (you buy/find ones with different attributes) which is diappointing. Now for the Aeons, your summoned beings. There are only 4, taken from FFIX, with some very nice enhanced graphics. Unfortunately, the summoning scenes are excrutiatingly long (at least 15 seconds each and every time. Apparently Square was so enamured with the graphics, you CANNNOT shorten them as in prior FF games. You might as well get up and make a sandwich everytime you summon), so you prefer to leave Yuna, the heroine out of the battles. The sphere grid is a neat new way of upping HP and MP, and is actually challenging to maze through.  The side game of Blitz is fair, but I found the control buttons do not respond per the instructions. You'll see. And, the game controls the matches. I prefered the card games in FF VIII and IX. And for you mothers of 12 year old boys, FFX graphics are true to EVERY scantily clad female body movement, so be ready for Lulu the Black Mage.
I play nothing but RPG's and Res-Evil style games. RPG stands for Role Playing Game. There is little to be had here except for moving the characters in and out of the battle scenes. I have 30 hours into this game only because I couldn't believe Square would come out with another game/movie (guess I forgot Xenogears) As a game, this falls so far short. As an example of computer graphic capabilities, Square has given us the showcase of the year. And I do mean a showcase. This is the feather in Square's graphics cap.
I have played every FF game, as well as almost every RPG made. I cannot recommend you buy this as a game, new. I would wait a week for the movies fans to return theirs, and buy it then. Since it is totally linear, without skip capabilities, I would not rent this. You will have it a while. Perhaps I will update this after I finish the `game', unless I just get sick of it and move on.
There are several other Square games much more suited to GAMING. I recommend FF IX most highly, as well as ChronoCross (very nicely done), the sequel to ChronoTrigger. Also try, Legend of Dragoon, Star Ocean: Second Story, and Breath of Fire III.

Old Review on May 18, 2007:

Ultimately it's like Zeph Greenwell said.  Here's my two cents though:

If you're wanting more space anyways, instead of buying this just wait until there are plenty of the Xbox 360 Elites on the shelves and then sell your current console for $350 profit and then go buy the Elite.  Before any taxes that's a difference of about $130.  A bit cheaper than just buying this thing.  This way you not only have more room, you have the bigger badder version of the Xbox 360.

Still though, I feel it's utterly wrong from Microsoft to pull this stuff, especially the Xbox 360 Elite, out AFTER we fans of the console waited for so long out side of stores to get ours.

Upon opening and setting up the new console, I was excited to get the initial set up complete and throw in Titanfall and start playing. My excitement quickly faded when the initial set-up/download took over an hour and a half. After the download for the set-up was finished, I decided to check my internet connection and it was working at a fast speed with no foreseeable problems which drew more questions. I then went to type in the code to download the Titanfall game that was included in my bundle. After close to 3 hours, the download was only at 7% and I became worried. Still not wanting to give up on the Xbox one before I had even played it yet, I decided to throw in a game my wife had gotten and the console made me do an immediate update for her game which only took half an hour. Once the update was completed, it made me download the game to the hard drive which took an hour and a half. After her game finally finished downloading, she played it for about 20 minutes before we headed to bed for the night. Thinking that leaving the console for the next few hours to let Titanfall download seemed like a good idea. When I woke up in the morning and not only had the game not downloaded but the Xbox had turned off right after I went to sleep. When I turned the console on in the morning, the download had stopped and had gone back down to 1%. Just to be clear, I don't have a slow internet connection and the downloads were still taking forever to get anywhere at all. I've always been a fan of Microsoft, but it seems like they're going away from wanting to have user friendly systems and wanting to make a non-user friendly system that's as high tech as they can get it with taking away from user control. This is the worst system I've ever purchased and I will have a full refund by the end of the week. Despite the positive reviews on this page, please read user reviews online and you'll see the massive amount of complaints dealing with incredibly slow download times. A few things to keep in mind before purchasing this console..... the graphics are the exact same as the 360. Also, when a new system comes out for purchase there are several things you expect. You should expect it to be more streamlined and smaller with the new technology that's out there. With the xbox one, you get none of these things. The console itself is big and bulky and the new Kinect is twice as big as the 360 version. If you're seriously considering purchasing the Xbox One and are a fan of Microsoft gaming consoles, please just stick with the Xbox 360 and like I stated before, if you don't believe my review, look on all the Xbox One blogs online and you'll see how much it really is sinking in popularity.

6 June 2014**** Update. Talked to Microsoft about snail speed download times and I was told that's been happening a lot and they are working on it. Game finally finished downloading after 3 days off and on. Game itself was great with the one exception that it's only for online play. So as it doesn't have an offline campaign mode, when new games come out for the Xbox one and people move on to other games, you'll no longer be able to play this game.

10 June 2014**** Update Three: The Kinect is terrible as well. In addition to the Kinect being terrible, after trying to re-setup the voice recognition to turn the console on, it continues to fail.

2.0,False,"08 5, 2012",A2KJXEXBBUDHXA,B00320JAWY,B. Gentry,"Part of the PR campaign surrounding the release of this game involved putting members of the development team on podcasts. Their passion was infectious and the game seemed so story-driven that I decided to pick it up despite being burnt out on military shooters. However, as it turns out, this game is not more than the sum of its parts. In fact, it's outright derivative at critical points.

During their PR campaign there was a lead development guy who went on The Totally Rad Show. I caught quite a bit of the details he was talking about while playing. Candles that go out if you walk over them, the physics of a sand-based environment, footsteps scattering in a zen garden- all incredibly impressive details. Likewise the story was cohesive and layered. Different actions throughout the game garnered a real emotional reaction and overall it took a more serious (not to say completely serious) approach to the psychological horror or warfare.

With that said, it's as if the game was developed by a truly passionate, talented group of people on one side and a rushed, lesser talented team on the other. The game has such incredible potential based on the core of the story and setting. However, it's plagued by both technical and story issues to the point of sheer frustration.

Normally I don't mind pop-in or texture issues but it was fairly distracting here. The level design is set up in such a way that odds are always stacked against the player. Not in a challenging sort of way but instead in a mind-numbingly annoying sort of way. I died many times throughout this game and not once did I discover a better tactic or load-out. That, coupled with the gameplay being primarily composed of enemy waves, it just felt frustrating and by-the-numbers. A minor nitpick- for being set in Dubai it does no service to the city. If nothing else the non-informative load screens should have had details such as, ""Before the storm 3,049,393 lived here. Now there are only 6,493."" The city could have easily been a character onto itself, not just an excuse for boats stuck in sand dunes.

If this had Call of Duty on the cover it'd be heralded as ushering in a new era of video game storytelling. (Although that speaks more to the blind praise of CoD.) There are indeed clever moments but just as many distracting lines quoted from famous work. There are moments of exposition that fall into extreme, almost drug-induced, hallucinatory settings which, for as serious as this game wants to be taken, is just ridiculous. In general, if something has a good ending all else can be forgiven. *SPOILER* However, the ending is almost a page-by-page recreation of Fight Club and is downright plagiarism. By itself, that particular reveal is cliche and poor storytelling. Part of the greatness of Fight Club is that it earns the right and pulls it off because of master-level storytelling and complexity leading up to that point.

This game feels like it's struggling with what it wants to be and, as a result, crumbles under its own weight. I'll be interested to see what this development studio does next but this game just wasn't worth my time. I still love the concept though, and that makes it all the more disappointing.","Derivative, but more importantly, disappointing",1344124800,6,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

2.0,False,"08 19, 2003",A2JU4FUSW1PBEC,B00009KX7C,Michael P.,"First let me start off by saying I absolutely love the Aliens vs. Predator franchise.  Its probably one of the best ideas that had ever been conceived.  Pitting two of the most popular movie monsters of all time against one another in a fight to the death...what could be more fun?  Well, unlike the other Aliens vs. Predator games, AvP:Extinction breaks the First Person Shooter criteria and comes in with a Real-Time Strategy game.  Its a nice attempt, but ultimately flawed.
The graphics in the game are sub-par...as far as a strategy game goes they're decent, but just very average...clearly nowhere near the caliber of Warcraft III or Command and Conquer: Generals.  However, examining the creatures up close yields further distortions in graphics.  Some of the aliens look ridiculous, and the Predators look just plain silly.  The design is very cartoonish, just like Aliens vs. Predator 2 for the PC, which many people complained about.  The environments are also very drab and dull...nothing really stands out.  Some of the jungle environments are nice, but most of the environments, such as interior settings and caves, are just lifeless and boring.
The game itself is very simplistic.  While creating endless droves of Aliens is alot of fun, the whole game just lacks substance.  Aliens use the Queen to lay eggs, and drag back hosts that they killed (or more likely, just invaded and nearly wiped out your colony the moment the mission started).  The Queen is basically the epicenter of the hive...you purchase all upgrades by selecting her, and using 'currency' earned by killing your enemies, you can upgrade your aliens.  The basic Alien species are there: the warrior, the drone, the dog alien from Alien 3, the praetorian introduced in the AvP games, and new Aliens called 'Ravagers', which are huge, monstrous aliens with blades for hands that rend and maim opponents.  The 'Carrier' is a large Alien that allows facehuggers to attach to its dorsal spines and leap out at enemies as you go.  Nice ideas, though the creatures themselves look uninspired.  All the aliens have unique abilities, and playing as them was an overall fine experience, but the game is just not executed well.
As for Predators, you are very limited in forces, which is understandable considering how powerful they are.  The only building they have is the 'Shrine', where upgrades can be purchased and new Predators summoned.  All the Predators have unique abilities and weapons, though some of them look uterly ridiculous...one Predator has a scythe, and it just doesn't go well with the whole Predator look.  Cloaking is utterly useless, since it seems that everyone and everything can see you regardless.  Predators earn curency by killing, as well as taking trophy skulls of their enemies.
Marines are simple enough to use, though difficult to play.  The 'CommTech' is used to purchase upgrades and summon more units from the dropship.  If the commtech is killed, you're out of luck.  Some of the humans are immensely powerful, which throws the balance of the game off alot.  The marines don't have any structures of any kind, just one landing beacon where the drop ship lands.  Marines earn currency by fixing 'Atmos' which generate steady income.  They must be defended, since Aliens and Predators will try to destroy these every chance they get.
The game is unbeleivably difficult...it should be the Aliens that come in countless swarms...not marines and Predators.  The final Alien mission is infuriating...the moment the mission starts out, you are attacked by all three sides (Marine, Predator, Mutant Aliens) and they don't attack each other...they attack you.  Some of the earliest Predator missions open up right into the middle of a fire fight...the Predators should be able to decimate marines but the endless swarm of marines and their incredibly strong fire power are too much.  The game can end before you even get out of the starting area.  As for marines...forget it.  Aliens and Predators swarm you so much you won't even know whats going on half the time.
Overall, the game's biggest fault is that it was designed narrowly...with the consoles in mind.  All the races, while characteristically different, are fundamentally the same.  None have any structures, other than the main population center (Queen, Shrine, Landing Beacon).  The game is somewhat unbalanced, with some units just being far too powerful.  The idea of Alien procreation is good and is probably one of the best aspects of the game, but this game is just far too basic of an RTS. Perhaps its biggest fault is the complete lack of Multi-player and custom missions.  Once you beat the game, that's it.  You're done.  There is nothing else to do, unless you want to try for a 'medal' by fulfilling all mission requirements in a certain amount of time.  The game is virtually devoid of extras, and there are no ending cinematics...when you beat a campaign...that's it...you're just done.  You won.  Nothing else.  There is no downloadable content or anything else...this is strictly a one-player strategy game that, once beaten, has absolutely nothing else going for it.  This was a decent attempt to expand the Aliens vs. Predator franchise into a new game genre...but it fails.  Perhaps they should've paid more attention to existing strategy games...its utter lack of options and extras throws this game back almost ten years...compared to other RTS games, it is basic and completely mediocre.  The game was fun, but it took only about 2 or 3 days to complete, and playing it anymore beyond that became pointless, because there was nothing else to do.
This just further proves that RTS games belong on PCs, not consoles.  Had this game been released for the PC, with multi-player options, extra content, and a better game engine overall, then this would have been a winner.

What do I expect when I play an RPG?  Well, I plan on there being some interactions in towns with NPCs, side quests, and other fun things.  Instead, this game is just a looonngg mission.  Eventually the game opens up a little (but barely), and I kept wondering, ""When is this going to get interesting?""  For the first 10 hours I kept saying, ""Well, I'll take care of equipment when I reach a town.""  Well, you'll have a long wait if you do that.

If I want to do repetitive missions, there are plenty of games for that.  Not only is it repetitive and quite boring, you can very rarely travel back to places you came from.  There's never a break or ""slow-pace"" in the game, which most Final Fantasy's have, and that's part of the allure to them.  One of my favorite things about Final Fantasy XII was toward the end, your ability to go back and visit nostalgic places like Midgar and where Cloud met Aeris, etc.  There's nothing like this here.  The characters are rather boring as well, and the story is cliche.  I expect my RPGs to have a lot of fun side quests, linearity, and to be able to talk to NPCs and engage in dialogue.

Hold on to those nine bucks, friends: this game has two distinct problems, one in every version and one specific to the PSP.

The general problem is that while the game touts Atari 2600 games at your beck and call, you have to unlock them by playing the marquee games.  And not incrementally, but en toto.  You have to clear ALL of the roadblocks for ALL of the games or you don't get any 2600 games at all.  So even if you NEVER liked, say, ""Warlords"", you have to jump its hurdles to get any 2600 games to unlock.

The PSP specific problem is that some of these games are cocktail table style, which means you have to turn the PSP on its end to play some of the games.  Ever tried playing something on its end that's not designed to play on its end?  It's excrutiating!

2.0,True,"05 22, 2008",A3HPMBAMQ16YGM,B0010EI6TM,Ram Eachambadi,"This game is not very different from its predecessor, Vegas I, in terms of the graphics, design, and special effects. However, in this game, the player is required to create a character-type of his/her own. The player can choose from different male and female models for the main character. The player is also allowed to use his/her own face for the respective body type (male/female). What the player cannot choose is the name of the character, or the story of the game. The game also has a ranking system that promotes the player based on how many points he/she has achieved as a marksman, or in close-quarter combat or assault. The highest rank that can be achieved is elite.

The terrorist hunt mode helps the player gain points. So, the player is not required to play the story mode to accumulate points. The story of the game, in my opinion, is very unrealistic. There is also a goof-up with the story. Mind the spoiler alert when I say this: Gabriel misleads Bishop all the way in the Nevada desert to try to get him killed. This happens on the night July 3rd, the very same night that Logan and his team rescue Gabriel from Dante's Casino. The time span involved is very small. This could not have been a deliberate action on the part of the creators. Furthermore, Bishop is shown to have been unconscious for an extremely long period of time. So, he never gets to inform Logan and his team of Gabriel's betrayal.

The above error is inexcusable on the part of the game's producers. So, one star should go away for that. I also believe an out-of-the-blue character named Bishop was unwarranted. Furthermore, his voice sounds almost robotic. That goes for the female voice as well. I truly believe that an emergency situation such as the one shown in the game required the return of Ding Chavez to the field. Or if not Chavez, some other experienced Rainbow Six operative such as Eddie Price, Loiselle Louis or Murad Jamal. I also believe that a story involving a larger role for Logan was warranted after the events of the previous game.

This story was just too predictable. And Gabriel, who is portrayed to be arrogant and rather quick to take drastic actions was a poor choice for the main bad guy of the story. Someone else more powerful, smart, resourceful, and mysterious must have been shown as the main head of the attacks. Gabriel could have been portrayed as a tool who gets eliminated. I think that would have added a lot of suspense to the story. All these reasons have made it necessary for me to take three stars away from the overall rating. But the game is still a lot of fun to play. So, that part of it gets five stars. I must add that something about the ending of this game and the whole story in general leads one to conclude that Ubisoft is doing away with the Rainbow Six franchise. If I am correct, this has marked the end of Rainbow Six in the gaming world. I will not be surprised if there are no further releases in this franchise.","Poor extension of Vegas I, but fun to play",1211414400,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

As for Episode One:

Graphics: It is admittedly starting to look dated. Graphically it doesn't compete with the latest games (FEAR, Oblivion or even Tomb Raider for goodness sakes) but nevertheless it is better still than average. The Half-Life engine is still the best at creating facial characters (at least vis-a-vis Oblivion) though this seldom matters. The textures, particularly when you are close up are very dated compared to modern games but the water still shines in its subtle way. You still feel like you are in a hovercraft, as there is no real sense of moving properly or stepping - you are simply sliding around, no real sense of proper movement, you cast no shadows and have no legs, you are basically riding a rail.

Sound: Superb. This is where the game really shines. Great sound effects and the music maintains the momentum of the scene in question to aid in the atmosphere.

AI: Half Life 2 was a step down in this department from Half Life 1 and this is still the case here. There are no tough opponents in this game and no clever tactics to defeat you that were present in the Half Life 1 and its brilliant sequel Opposing Force. Much better things to be found elsewhere.

Story Telling. This is where Valve has traditionally shined. The original Half Life was a masterpiece in this area. More recent games such as FEAR and FarCry borrowed heavily from Half Life 1 and in some areas expanded on it. Half Life 2 though, despite some brilliant set pieces was a step backward in this area from the original. Episode 1 does nothing to bring back the atmosphere from Half Life 1 and does not offer and real answers to the questions being raised. When Half Life 2 was released I was working in the gaming industy. The game was hyped to the unbelievable and I bought it on the first day. After a week none of the gamers talked about it again as everyone had moved on to games with some substance. Nothing will change with Episode 1.

Value for Money: You are better off waiting for the FEAR expansion pack or playing Oblivion (if for some reason you haven't discovered it as yet). Episode 1 simply doesn't offer a reasonable enough experience for the money. With so many new things just around the corner (think Crysis) it is difficult to justify a purchase here.",Stale and dated...,1153440000,6,,

Would you go to a movie 4-5 times to see better cuts f shots or CGI fixes? No. This game has all the potential of Skyrim, and unfortunately the same issues 4 years on.
Server issues, characters disappear - there's a long list of major bugs with this game. If you liked Skyrim, you'll like this as well, but the best advice anyone could give you is WAIT.

The Bad: Very hard to make friends, terrible English voices, extremely simple

I don't mind sexually driven games, but I like them to be good and done right. Xtreme 2 is the sequel to Xtreme Beach Volleyball for the original Xbox. Everything is in tact, with a few additions. The consists of 6 mini-games, and 5 casino games, but that's not enough to save this simple-minded game.

The whole point of the game is to play mini-games with other DoA ladies and earn their trust and friendship and this is harder than it seems. The game plays similar to a Japanese dating sim game, and it can take forever to buy a lot of the items, and learn how to become friends with these lovely ladies. You have to figure out what each lady likes, loves, and hates and send them gifts accordingly. All you get is a visual guide for each lady with pictures of what they like, but this doesn't help much. After you spend a whole two weeks at New Zack Island you pretty much give up trying to gain trust and friendship since it's so hard to figure out without some in-depth guide. After a tries you end up just playing the mini-games and ogling the scantily clad women lying around, and even dancing.

The mini-games are the most fun of the game with pool hopping, flag running, beach volleyball, jet skiing, and water sliding. Pool hopping consists of pressing the buttons according to what is shown on the floaties. This game tends to be very hard since it requires precise timing. Flag running is pretty simple, but the best game is probably volleyball. It has tight mechanics and controls and can be a blast to play. Jet skiing is very mundane since it's the same track over and over again, however, the water effects are nice and doing tricks on the ski can be fun. Water sliding is the hardest game of them all since it's so hard to stay on the slide and after you fall off you don't get another try. After you earn enough money from playing mini-games you can purchase a camera and take sexy photos of the ladies, and view them later in your album.

The casino is the second major part of the game that lets you really earn some bucks. All the games are pretty self-explanatory, roulette tends to be the most intense, but you can lose all your money in one go if you're not careful so watch how you spend your money. The casino is all in 3D so it's nice to view, but I wish you could walk around in it and see all your DoA lady friends playing in there as well. When you earn enough money you can go buy stuff at the store to give your lady friends or yourself.

The game really has no purpose except to ogle your favorite DoA girls and trying to buy the skimpiest bikini for them. The graphics are great and everything jiggles in all the right places. The audio is pretty mundane with Japanese audio tracks to cover the horrible English voice actresses. The game isn't serious, but it could be so much more, and I just hope DoA Xtreme 3 becomes more deep and involved. I just wish there would have been more interaction, and all the load times don't help either. The game is just to hard to figure out with the whole dating sim thing going on so just sit back and enjoy the women and mini-games. The game will make you choke your chicken for sure, so DoA fan boys (girls?) should pick this game up and enjoy it's simplicity.","Uber sexy, but way too confusing to play and understand",1332892800,4,,

I knew who the culprit was from the beginning. Essentially this game felt tedious --  it was filled with long, boring puzzles which had little relevance to mystery.

I didn't feel satisified as I had with the earlier games or a hunger for the next one.

I felt the game was tedious and when the cuprit was revealed, my response was to shrug. There are two alternate endings depending on how you respond to the culprit after confronting him. This twist might make the game slightly more interesting, but the game play doesn't really alter that much. You don't see an entirely different game sequence. Rather Nancy writes alternatively in her letter -- that the culprit either leaves the ryokan or begs for forgiveness, and either way, do you really care?

Not to be too hard on this game. Was it worth $19 for this experience? No. Is this a must have game? No. I'd get it if you love Japanese culture and are a puzzle maven. Ultimately, I found this game very unsatisfying and wondered why I even bothered watching it on YouTube. My feeling was -- that's all there is? Whatever.  The problem ultimately is the writing. While the dialog is better than recent games, it's stilted, takes the form of an inquisition, and you don't really feel drawn into the game. I think more creativity, ingenuity, and thought into the writing and plot development would have served the game better. Instead, you essentially solvce the mystery by stumbling through an alleged ghost haunting by default.

There were a number of loose ends left too. We should have had some communication -- or even mention of Savannah and her underling  before the finale -- and at least the final letter. Instead Nancy calls S, gets her brain picked,and then we never hear from her again. We don't really know what happens to the alleged love affair between Bess(?) and S's aide. Essentially it appears that the guy was used to help the girls solve the mystery. In another part, the duo flirt/use their feminine wiles to get men to cough up clues because of how enticing they are. Great message to be sending girls. Want evidence? Flirt with men to make them give it to you.

I also think parents should be warned that this game markets gambling to children thorugh the Pachinko Parlor. Essentially Nancy steals someone else's gaming card, runs up a huge tab, gambles with no consequence to herself beyond the ability to buy lots of cute things she can keep for herself or give to others. Rentaro even tells her how she can cheat the games and beat the casino. Nancy even gets an award at the end for being a high roller gambler and for buying the most toys with her ill gotten wealth.

Nancy also thinks nothing of confronting the elder grandmother about the hauntings, even though Nancy on her own volition chose to investigate the hauntings and meddle in the personal affairs of this family. Berating elders as Nancy did is of supreme disrespect in Japanese culture and makes Nancy out to be an ugly American. She demonstrated little finesse or diplomacy in her interactions. Instead she comes in like a bull in a china shops, invades private, personal spaces, like an entitled brat, interrogates grieving family members, and then once she has solves the ryokan mystery, which no one enlisted her to do or necessarily even welcomed in the first place, she goes off and parties in Japan. As I said, ugly American.

As I said, this game is solid, but ultimately unfulfilling. If you want to avoid the tedious puzzles and just experience the adventure, you can watch the game play out on YouTUbe without having to shell out the $19 plus shipping and handling, which I consider to be a colossal waste of money for what you get.",Unsatisfying Puzzle Zone,1289088000,4,,

Hopefully, this product will last longer than the 6 month lifespan of the Razer Naga, because that would be about the only thing going for it.

It might be because I am so used to the Naga, but I do not really like new configuration of the 12 MMO buttons... really, the only thing I buy these MMO gaming mice to use.  The bumps feel unnecessary when it all should just boil down to muscle reflex.

In DOTA terms, it means your character ends up going the wrong way or doing the wrong thing.

(Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev),"I didn't have the highest expectations from this after hearing it's not the same kind of game as the first Adventure Time game by Wayforward was, but JEEZ! I didn't expect the team to drop the ball! If you were expecting a platformer like before, Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I'm Trying to Make the Title Funny by Being Random will make you be beyond sorely disappointed. Rather than be inspired by Zelda II, this game takes its cues from oldschool classic Gauntlet. And I wish it didn't.

Look, Gauntlet is fine in its own right, but this Adventure Time take on the concept doesn't do anything differently from it other than add technical flaws. The core gameplay is that you roam around in a confined level map and look for the exit, probably killing enemies and collecting goods along the way. That's literally it. What made Gauntlet work, however, is the subtle variety its levels offer and the emphasis on multiplayer. Here? Every level feels the same but with a new coat of paint and different-in-the-littlest-sense objects every five or ten levels that pass. And while the console versions of this game have multiplayer, the Nintendo 3DS version is very ironically a single-player only affair.

And then there are problems with the decorations that clothe the game; yes there is voice acting, but only to an extent. Retro-ized cutscenes that pop up every ten levels (and in the beginning) have full voice acting, but dialogue boxes get obnoxious ""Blah blah blah"" voiceovers (I'm serious. That's an acted out voice clip), and the in-game voice clips for when you do things get annoying fast. It doesn't help that Finn somehow sounds wimpier during combat than he should have been. As if that wasn't enough, the framerate is somehow LESS THAN 30 FRAMES PER SECOND, and if you die, you have to start over from the first of the ten levels you explore (basically, ten levels = one world, and there's a hundred levels....).

Wayforward, I love you guys, but this game just isn't good at all. You're one of the development teams that prove that licensed games don't have to suck, so I just don't understand how this particular one came to be.",A poor follow-up,1424304000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

2.0,False,"11 2, 2008",ACUYXGCMWVF7S,B000X9FV5M,Matthieu P. Raillard,"Back in 2004, the original Far Cry came out of nowhere.  It burst onto the first person shooter scene that had been dominated by ID (Quake, Doom, etc) and Valve (Half-Life series), and gave everyone an innovative FPS with amazing graphics, huge, almost sandbox levels, good AI and an original locale.  The stage was set for a sequel, which everyone eagerly anticipated.  The original Far Cry team released Crysis in 2007, and Ubisoft (the publisher) released Far Cry 2 in 2008.  This sequel, as many reviewers have pointed out, is rather disappointing.

PROS: A unique environment (Africa) that hasn't been done to death.  A tons of unlockable guns, and a good assortment of fun weapons like flamethrowers, grenade launchers and mortars.  Decent, though overrated AI.  Save-anywhere is nice, as are your buddies which help you out.

CONS: An essentially soulless environment, tedious and repetitive gameplay.  It's amazing how devoid of any personality the world is.  It's a largely repetitive, empty world, which you will be tediously crisscrossing ad nauseam in order to get to your next mission.
The missions are almost always assassination missions (drive to point X, kill Y) or FedEx missions (drive to point X, deliver Y).  The problem is that the environment is not really open-ended.  High mountains mean that the only way to get around for most of the game is by car, and this means that you HAVE to drive by the same stupid guard posts every time.  Unlike Far Cry or Oblivion, you are pretty much stuck on the roads that the developers want you to use.  The graphics are nice but nothing compared to Crysis or even Oblivion!  I run the game on Ultra-High with DirectX 10 and am not overwhelmed.

The AI is also not nearly as amazing as advertised.  The bad guys take a seemingly endless amount of shots to die, which really cuts into the realism.  They can spot you at night, in the brush, from 100 yards away, and are amazing drivers and shooters.

While the storyline is disjointed and at times incredibly clich, in a 1st person shooter the plot often plays second fiddle to gameplay, and it is in this area that IGI 2 is strongest, though certainly not groundbreaking or incredibly entertaining.

The premise is simple. Ex SAS operative David Jones, working for the mysterious (and fictional) ""Institute for Geotactical Intelligence"" must sneak his way through a variety of different levels, naturally accomplishing objectives ranging from sabotage to infiltration.

As a stealth shooter, David Jones must be navigated through a series of extremely large levels, disabling guards and infiltrating deep into facilities. With such large, sprawling levels, loading times are long, and it often takes more than an hour to complete a single mission. The game features the usual assortment of weaponry, all of which sound suitably powerful, though often most of the level will pass without issuing a single unsilenced shot. While all this may seem terribly suspenseful and interesting, several flaws greatly detract from what could have been a great gaming experience.

Firstly, the lack of a proper savegame feature prevents players from saving until the end of a level, which can be frustrating, especially when a single alarm usually results in an unrelenting storm of hostile enemies. Secondly, there is little in the game to justify any other weapon than the silenced pistol. Hideously overpowered, the pistol is just as powerful as a submachine gun, possesses greater range than a rifle, and, when fired, does not kick. Since many of the other weapons are not fitted with silencers, most of the levels can be completed with the aforementioned handgun rather than its more powerful counterparts.

Thirdly, the enemy is unbelievably accurate. There are few situations more infuriating than coming a few minutes from the end of a mission and being taken down by a few highly precise submachine gun rounds, thus forcing you to restart the level again. Likewise, it is incredibly irritating when, after having guided David Jones to hide behind a conveniently placed tree, the enemy lets loose a few rounds that pass through the trunk to eliminate the unfortunate operative, much to my chagrin. The game thus evolves into one in which David Jones must crawl from shrub to shrub, snapping off a few well placed shots and generally attempting to escape detection.

On a more positive note, the music is suitably suspenseful, and the voice acting is generally very sound.

In conclusion, Project IGI 2 is at best a mediocre 1st person shooter. The lack of a proper savegame function, a palette of boring brown/grey visuals, long loading times and several flaws in gameplay culminate in a frequently exasperating gaming experience.

The problem with Ether isn't what it's not, it's what it failed in trying to be. It wants to have a deep emotional narrative but hides it behind ""optional"" puzzles and scavenger hunts that are so obscure  and incoherent that you'll more often than not have found a crucial item for a puzzle or to open a new area or room only to have to ""warp"" back to the hub to retrieve it from the limited shelf space on your literal storage shelf because you didn't have the hindsight to work out that the key you picked up immediately after finding the bit of cotton wool tied to a wolf's claw that triggers the answering machine in a room you've been in exactly twelve times to tell you to go toward the lake and take a left but don't forget that key you picked up, oh wait!  The inventory system is interesting but takes up needless amounts of time, you can hold one item at a time in your hand, hands? You can also warp to a sort of house-sized lock box for additional storage. This becomes tedious and can often lead to you losing your since of direction or outright forgetting what items you need when or after you've finally found a place on the self for the new thing you've found, what item you where there for in the first place or why you needed it. If only the protagonist had heard of the modern necessity that are pockets or a backpack or carrying an item in each hand and not wasting both on a small wooden horse that couldn't weigh more than an eighth of a pound. On the positive is the hand drawn art style of the surrounding areas. It doesn't seem to mesh with the serious almost somber at times feel of the narrative but it is nice to look at. The music is also well done, although it constantly changing each time you enter a room or the fact that each track goes to repeat after about two to five minutes can be a little maddening if your trying to solve a puzzle, want to explore the area or are just plan lost running around like mad trying to find the next dialog trigger room to progress in the story. The controls are that same as from games like Outlast or any FPS so the learning curve for that is quit minimal. You can even run and jump, even though their are rarely if any occasions when such activity is necessary.

Perhaps I will have better luck abandoning the campaign and just playing custom games, but the ""improved"" battlenet interface is so stylized that it is difficult to navigate.

2.0,False,"02 4, 2015",A2ZW8FZTH5U1BE,B00CH9253W,K. F.,"Mario Party: Island Tour is an extremely disappointing entry in the Mario Party lineup, especially when compared to its predecessor, the vastly superior Mario Party DS. While Nintendo has a tradition of taking two steps forward, one step back with their long-running franchises, Island Tour is more like one step sideways, two steps back.

Island Tour eschews the traditionally Mario Party formula in favor of race boards. While older Mario Party games had you travelling around the board for a fixed number of turns, the goal in Island Tour is generally to be the fastest to reach the finish line. This concept sounds interesting at first, but it quickly becomes apparent that it utterly cripples the game, making Island Tour a hollow shell of the franchise, with about as much depth as a playing card.

Let me review some of the downsides to Island Tour's ""race-to-the-finish"" boards:
*You cannot adjust the number of turns a game will last
*2v2 team play has been removed - no more teaming up with your significant other to battle the CPUs
*There are no 2v2 or 1v3 minigames
*Most boards do not have items - no more hexing your opponents or warping to a different spot on the board
*Gameplay is significantly more random
*The first player in the turn order has a massive advantage

Adjustable-length games and team play were key features of earlier titles. You could make any board last any length of time by adjusting the number of turns. In Island Tour, wanting a game of a certain length locks you into a few boards - if you want to play a short 20-minute game, you're stuck with one of the two pure-luck boards, which are a complete waste of time. Each board in Mario Party DS was detailed and lovingly crafted, with its own unique twist on the gameplay, because the developers knew you might spend hours at a time on one board. In Island Tour, most boards were made to last around half an hour and no longer - they might be pretty to look at, but they lack the memorable features and unique hazards we've come to expect out of Mario Party boards. Themed special event spaces are replaced with generic ""swap all of the players' positions"" spaces and little else.

Island Tour is balanced to be far too random; luck has always played an important part in Mario Party games, but skill is heavily downplayed in Island Tour - even in the board rated maximum skill and minimum luck, my girlfriend and I both consistently feel that our actions are meaningless and victory lies entirely in the hands of chance. Decision making is almost entirely removed from the equation - no traps, no cool items, hardly any forks in the road. Many of the boards are intentionally designed to be random, with everything coming down to the die rolls. You generally earn some type of booster for winning minigames, but a 3x booster is useless if you roll a 0, not to mention all of the boosters in the world won't guarantee you victory on these boards. Each board is scattered with scramble spaces that will change all of the player's positions in some way. In some games we found that a player landed on a scramble space nearly every turn; your progress and use of boosters is meaningless if everyone's positions keeps getting scrambled.

Regardless of how everyone plays, the player who rolled highest at the start is usually going to win. As usual in the series, everyone rolls a die at the beginning to determine turn order. Here's the problem - if the game ends as soon as anyone reaches the finish line, the first player has a distinct advantage, since they have the earliest opportunity to reach it. In the previous Mario Party titles, the turn order rarely mattered - everyone got to take the same number of turns, and any time someone nabbed a star, a new one appeared immediately. In Island Tour, I've found that the first player wins more than half of the time.

The unlockables this time around are a joke - you can buy a tiny 3D portrait for each character and level that comes with a sound board. Really, Nintendo? I didn't even think sound boards were exciting when I was 10.

Island Tour does have some pretty fun minigames, but the same can be said of every entry in the series, so it's not much of a selling point.

Mario Party: Island Tour is perhaps the weakest game in the series (not including the single-player Mario Party Advance), a title only suited for very young players with no experience in the series, or those who prefer skill to be taken out of the equation. If you want a mobile Mario Party game, get Mario Party DS - I guarantee you will be playing it long after you would have tossed out Island Tour.",A huge step backward compared to Mario Party DS,1423008000,2,,

I thought all along that 3 monsters didn't sound like enough, but that isn't the only problem.  The extra game modes just aren't a lot of fun, and the maps don't feel that different from one another.  I found out which characters I liked best, and which monster I liked best, and then it got old fast.  Initially, though, it is fun. And I thought it might have more replay value as it is a very different experience being a monster than it is being a hunter, and each hunter and each monster is different.  I quickly found which monster I liked the best, and which couple of characters I liked the best, though, and then the fun disappeared.  They needed more variety to come on the disc for $60.  23 hours in and I'm ready to move on to the next thing.  That's very short for a multi-player game nowadays.  I never got sick of Left 4 Dead, I love that game still, but the downside of the 4 vs. 1 is that you don't get great rivalries going because you aren't on teams swapping roles back and forth like in Left 4 Dead.  Also, Left 4 Dead's campaigns were all so different, it gave it a long life.  This just feels like the same thing over and over.  And if you want more hunters and more monsters, its set to cost you around $40 just for one more monster($15) and 4 more hunters($25).  That's crazy.  If you want to try the game then probably the best thing to do is wait a year or so till a Game of the Year edition packed with lots more content and selling at a discounted price becomes available.

There is not much in the way of challenges in this game, most puzzles are the same with a slight increase in complexity as you go through the game. It is mostly walking around and solving the same types puzzles. The interaction with other characters is nothing special either, the dialog is weak and linear as is the entire game.

I was a bit disappointed at the performance and design of this headset. Though it has a sturdy build and in-line sound control, sound isn't impressive, and the clunky wires makes this a very heavy desktop experience.

Sound
I really like the bass and it's booming power, but the clarity isn't very good. Sound feels flat and lacks dimension and cohesion. These might as well have been earbuds.

Microphone
I like the design. It is flexible and can be shaped into any mold. Sound recording is sufficient, but not good enough for basic video voice overs.

Sound control and wires
Wow, the wires are really clunky and heavy. I had to bundle them all up in a bun so I can use it on my desktop. It's quite heavy when moving around.

Design
Very interesting design, not very conventional. The frame is solid with metal and cushioned well. The earcups has a triangular shape, which looks a little odd. I personally didn't like the look of this headset.

Thrustmaster, it's time to get back to the drawing board. This is a good start. Suggested improvements: 1) less wires 2) place the sound control on the wired headset like Logitech, Corsair, and Plantronics have done 3) Improve the microphone recording quality 4) Stereo sound has poor range, needs more depth and clarity in the mid range","Good bass, decent sound - poor range, too clunky with wires, below-average mic",1366761600,,{'Style:': ' PS3 & PC'},

I didn't mod it and I've heard that some of the mods make it easier but I normally go vanilla when I can.  The game is buggy and will often freeze for a second while it loads many objects in the outside world.  There is also way too much walking around which gets rather dull as you try and slog your way through killing a million guys.  But the real game killers for me were the endless radiation and the inaccuracy of the shooting engine.  Normally a head shot should be an instant kill but not so in this game.  I'm deadly accurate with a mouse having played FPS's since the mid 90's but very often it takes many head shots too take a guy down in this damn game.  It's a major flaw and so is the radiation.  Even with the radiation suit some areas are so hazardous that you barely have time to employ an anti-rad before you die.  FYI I recommend anybody who wants to venture into playing this do so on the novice level.  I never play novice levels and played the Stalker level which is the next level up but ultimately couldn't finish the game.  I got near the end but between the constant radiation and too many tough enemies it was impossible to finish it.  Which is unusual for me but I simply got tired of dying and reloading.  The constant radiation at the end was a game killer for me.  It isn't fun.  I could go on and on about other things I didn't like but this game needed to be redesigned.  From the beginning it felt like something that wasn't completed properly.  I guess that explains all the mods.  Either way I won't be playing the other Stalker games.

All the waiting for D3, and  this is how it ends. I have more questions than answers. Why does Act 1 seem so much better than Act 4 ?Where is all the level 60 gear ? Are we really being ""forced"" to use the $ AH ? What's the point of fighting a pack of 5 five buff elites, who singularly can kill you ? If I can't stay at range nor fight in close, what's my option ?

How much gear, what kind of gear does it take to compete in Act 3 ? Was the difficulty in Act 3 planned; and why ? Act 4: can it really get more difficult. Should I quit now and go play GW2 or SWTOR ?
Update ... spent 200 hours farming Act 1. Of course, 99.999% of drops is vendor trash. Finished Act 3. Tried Act 4; no chance. Now items needed cost, on average, $400,000,000. My current take is $1,000,000 per 5 hours of farming. Here's the game breaking rub; you will need to have deep pockets to finish D3. I'm guessing buying gold is legal ... I receive 3 offers each day. The cost for 1mil gold is now down to 43 cents. Gold is so devalued, farming is now a waste of time. My guess is, it will cost us at least $700 to buy Act 4 gear. Swapping to MF/GF gear while farming Act 3 is problematic. So, it looks like a cash grab when it is all said and done. How can a game penalize players willing to spend hundreds of hours grinding the same content. Well, if you devalue the purchasing power of the games asset/gold, only players with deep pockets can afford to play. Think about it, I spent 5 hours to make 1mil gold ... Another player can pull 43 cents out of his/her pocket. No; I refuse to sink more than the cost of the collectors game edition cost into this game. Where will the cost finally end. The cost of endgame gear looks like powerball tickets on steroids ... SHAMEFUL
Update 2 ... while waiting for severs to come back online after patch 1.05, went and purchased Torchlight 2
Update 3 ... after patch 1.05, gear prices have risen to the point of 'pay hundreds of dollars' or stop progressing. In fact, you could spend $1,000 easily and still not be outfitted in BIS gear. Before, you received messages for gold amounts of 1 million. As of last week, 10 million. Yesterday, bot'ters raised it to 20 million gold. Now the prices at the AH have topped 2,000,000,000/piece. Average gear now tops 10,000,000/piece. Good gear, if you're lucky can be found for 50,000,000/piece. To outfit yourself in excellent gear, will cost on average, 300,000,000/piece. If you want gear to do the hardest content, better crack open your checkbook. So, if your goal is to finish all 4 difficulties, no problem. Figure 40-50 hours per character. DON'T COUNT on drops to help. I have over 700 hours logged and I've found only '2' level 60 items which I then equipped. As of today, it 'costs' too much. The 'grind' is pointless.
It appears Blizzard as well as sellers are 'banking' on pvp to 'cash in'. Then, everyone who has great gear and/or gold to sell will pvp'ers tripping over themselves to 'gear up'. Blizzard has drop rates so low, they are forcing players to buy what they need. Once pvp is introduced, we can finally put the last nail in D3's coffin. Of course, I'm sure an expansion is planned to start the cycle once again. Had enough of this pay-to-win game and bot'ters driving up gear prices.

Not only was I disappointed but I was also shocked at how bad it is compared to the arcade game it's based on. California Speed came out in the late 90's and was fun to play in the arcades. Then it was ported to the Nintendo 64 and quite frankly, this was and still it a shoddy port. In California Speed, you pick a car and then a track to race in or choose to race every stage back to back. Of course, like any decent arcade racer, you could unlock bonus stages and cars. Up to two players can race against each other along with the other A.I. racers.

The PROS: It's an easy game to get into. The controls are spot on, even though driving in this game feels very floaty. When you're done playing by yourself and feeling a little evil, you can invite a friend over to share your disdain for this game.

The CONS: Midway made absolutely little effort in porting this game and it shows. The graphics, animation and frame rate all take a hit so it doesn't look as good as the arcade game. The music is average sounding but the sound effects sound so muffled, you'd swear they recorded it in a underwater studio. You won't break a sweat placing 1st in each race because the A.I. racers are ridiculously easy to beat. Midway decided to censor this game and it was probably because of Nintendo. You were able to run into pedestrians on certain tracks in the arcade version. No big deal since they looked like plastic figurines and bounced around after you hit them. For the N64 port, you can't do that at all since they are just out of reach in case you tried to do it. It's a short game and it doesn't help that they only allow 2 players to race at the same time while some other racing games allowed up to 4 players.

I loved the first Manhunt, but the quality and design of this one are 10 times lower than that of the first. The new weapons are cool, but every execution is fast and the camera is off in a strange angle so you can't really see what is going on.

The environments are disgustingly bland, dry, and boring. Almost each level is a box with a few crated and doors here and there. Where is the visual quality of the first game?! Each level uses the same objects used in every other level. There is no design to the levels, just a box of enemies to kill after another. Also, getting spotted usually results in game over. If you are knocked down by an enemy, you are stunned for about 5 seconds while they are beating on you. Even if you don't fall down, your character does a long drawn out stun animation giving the enemy a chance to hit you again, restarting the animation. If you get hit, you are essentially dead.

There is also WAY too big an emphasis on gunplay. In the first you had guns but they were never required. In this one, some levels each enemy has a gun and they are in a position where you HAVE to engage in a gun battle. Sneaking is not an option.

Learning Curve: 4- This title is as expected pretty linear and in tradition (well as tradition based as the past 3 years can yield)  of other linear games this one doesn't require a lot of you to get the hang of it. It is mostly hack and slash but expect to see some mobility learning with the capabilities of the cape and grappling with your chains, but still learning is pretty stress free and most of it will go into familiarizing yourself with weapon icons.

Replay Value: 3- Since this is a linear title don't expect there to be a high replay value of this title. It is a good rent for people needing their fix of the hellspawn hero, but purchase for the diehard fan isn't completely discouraged. It is now an affordable price. You can pass up a few comics this month and add this title to your collection.

Difficulty: 5- Expect to see some frustration from the bosses and sometimes you can be swamped by enemies. From what I can tell so far most of your tasks aren't time based so play should be otherwise stress free. This is a fun title for casual gaming.

Guide: There is a guide available through Bradygames for $14.99. Like all guides it is helpful, but navigating the game is pretty easy and the guide acts only to map certain difficult to find secrets of the game. For maximum fun try to find these on your own after you've completed level objectives.

Pros: Price, Nice FMVs, variety of baddies, versatile battle system for a inexpensive linear game, and very fun for casual gaming.

Cons: Suffers from normal linear title problems of replay and game simplicity, Spawn graphics in game lack a bit (Spawn looks too short and stocky,) the story lacks a bit, and the chain effects could have been better.

Time Expected to Invest: About a week to give the game a decent run through.

Retail Value: $19.99. If you do some digging you can find it for $14.99 at several stores and perhaps here within Amazon itself.

Suggested Purchase Price: Under $15 used or new.

Overall: 6- For fun factor. This game has had some horrible reviews and I think it is undeserved. I came to this title expecting a total piece of crap and to be honest I found it quite enjoyable. The gameplay isn't straight linear as it does give you the option to run back through the level to explore before moving on and there are hidden areas that you can miss if you aren't watchful. I don't think this title is worth it's original $50 price tag, but for $15 I think it's worth it. If you can find it cheap I recommend this title.

I still can't believe how people say the graphics are so good since they are all completely dull dark and dreary, not to mention blockier than most SNES games I've played.  The sound is nearly non existant.  hardly any music in the game at all, just a plethora of drips squeaks squeals and puking noises.  Gameplay isn't too bad, though it isn't exactly the most fluid I've ever played, and the objects in a room tend to get in your line of sight all too frequently, no matter how you swing the camera view.  The battle system is a Parasite Eve clone thats been tuned up to the point of being almost too complicated to use.  it takes practice for certain.  The monsters are outrageously easy if you simply use hit and run tactics.  the bosses on the other hand tend to be amazingly hard if you don't know what you are doing.  Plot is relatively non existant in this game.  the opening movie pretty much gives you the basic run of the game.  the game tends to lead you around by the nose for the first hour or so and then you have a very limited number of option available for the duration of the game.  Its just another dungeon crawl.  I love Dungeons and Dragons but even that gets boring if you do nothing but one dungeon exploration after another and thats really all this game is.  the true value of the game comes from being able to find a multitude of weapons and armor and then being able to make use of various workshops to combine those items into more powerful armaments.  unfortunately this is tedious and time consuming, taking up more than 3/4 of the game.  Overall they just took a rather bland game and tried to cram in all kinds of technical stuff, taking nearly every RPG option you could think of and trying to put it all in one game.

For shame the amount of pollution that was released into the atmosphere because of this game. How horrible that it will all be in the landfill someday where it belongs.

I rented this Jewel of the Vile for free (thank God) from my little brother's game collection. He handed it to me and said, ""Here...this one isn't...uh...it isn't really my thing.""

""Thing?"" He's only 16 so hasn't really mastered the use of the English language, so I can't blame him for being unable to eloquently describe the putrid nature of this game. Therefore, I will help him voice his opinion.

I was only able to sit and play this for about an hour. I kept waiting for the game to improve...but it never did. What accent is that on the vampire character? I suppose when it came to the voice acting that they couldn't afford a guy that sounded Transylvanian...they had to go for an American guy who -Vas taulkinguh like he vas an eeeevil scienteest goinguh to blow up zee vorld!-. The best part was when he called the idol of greed ""fatty"".

Also...what is wrong with this world's populations' pelvises? Leonardo stood like he was in a permanant state of humping or was beginning to bloat. Do the undead bloat in this world? I kept waiting for him to spike one giant chunk of his hair and say, ""It's time for a little demon cleansing, I MUST SAY!"" (Old Saturday Night Live reference for those of you too young to remember Martin Short's character Ed Grimley.)

I have never played the other Kingdom of Fire games...but (if I've heard correctly) they were more strategy-based. The makers should really have stuck to strategy...because whatever style this is simply sucks.

You run around...trying to find monsters to train your skills...which never happened for me. I got one spell but after that single spell (Heal) it seemed impossible. The vampire character (Lenny...or Lactate...something) is trying to mutate to become as strong as Rufus(...or was it Randy...?). It was fun in an oldschool Gauntlet at the arcade kind of way. After pegging the upteen-thousandth little scorpion with my Kunai of Frost and Wounding and Shrieking and Making Toast, however, I simply lost interest.

Basically...if you can get the game for free then have at it! It will at least fill up a little bit more space on your shelf so that when people come over they look at your games and say, ""Wow!

The package comes with a sound-wifi tower for ""better signal and sound quality."" However, despite the tower acting as a nice holder for the headset, setting it up is a pain as it requires constant connection through USB, & Optical Audio ports.

The PX510 comes with adjustable settings that adjust the audio to your preference. However, despite these nice features, they become taunting as they always have to be reset back to your preference whenever the headset is turned on. I addition to that, when they're turned on, they don't connect properly, either the tower doesn't receive signal, or the Bluetooth doesn't connect properly or the microphone doesn't work. As for the distance, I've gotten a maximum of 4.5 feet from the tower itself before losing connection when everything was working PROPERLY.

For the price and their actual functionality, the PX510's are far too expensive for what they finally deliver; a tedious setup, and a 50/50 chance of them working PROPERLY when initially turned on.

Cons:
I'll only talk about 1 problem so this isn't a book of a review. A lot of the other problems in the game follow this same formula. During Legacy play, you practice things such as shooting, rebounding, post defense, etc to develope your players. This should have been fun, but 2K dropped the ball here. I have now tried the 3-point shot drill many times (maybe 40) and still haven't passed it once. That might be besides the fact, but there are good reasons it is so difficult and it isn't my skills. The camera pans in everytime you shoot so you cant see your player anymore. The player will also move (sometimes a lot) after they shoot and you will have to wait for the camera to pan back, wait for the rebounder to get you the ball back (takes 2-3 seconds, which is an eternity), set yourself- making sure you are in the circle they want you to shoot from, then you can shoot and hope you remain in the circle during your shot. This is a problem, folks. In shooting drills it is very important to 'flow' and how did 2K expect us to flow when there is so damn much going on at once before, during, and after each shot?? It kills the fun and makes the game more of a hassle than entertainment. The menus are frustrating as well. For instance, they make you hit ""OK"" sometimes when ""OK"" is the only option. ""EXIT"" is another one they like to make you take time to press. I hope you follow what I mean here. If you only have 1 option, why do they make you think about it? haha. Geez.

Pros:
The actual gameplay during games is great. Fun. The graphix aren't anything new, but good. There are plenty of teams and conferences to choose from so chances are your favorite team is in the game (go Xavier). Some of the other drills are fun, even if there are those few that will have you more angry than anything.

Bottomline, this game is great if you only focus on actually playing the actual games, but there is totally too much frustration going on that its hard to WANT to turn the game on in the first place. I would recommend trying EA's college basketball game first. I personally haven't played it yet, but this game by 2K isn't what you're probably looking for.

1. Frame rate issues everywhere. The poor little Wii doesn't seem to be able to keep up with the game engine's insane level of detail, leading to really choppy scenes and movement. Thing is, the Wii SHOULD be able to handle this - I think it was just poorly ported.

2. Random weird sound effects. There are some rooms where you enter, and it sounds like you're under a herd of stampeding cattle for no reason. It's annoying and after a few minutes in the room, it just makes you want to return the game for a refund.

3. You don't feel particularly heroic. Going around levitating things for other wizards (who apparently can't master the most basic of spells, so they ask you to do it) feels contrived, pointless, and ultimately not why we play video games. There are several places in the game where I swear I'm not playing Harry Potter any more, but instead I'm playing Box Stacker(tm). (For those of you who don't read The Onion, go Google for it. You'll get what I'm saying then.)

4. People have mentioned the lurching pace of the videos; I describe it as if someone had rented the DVD version and accidentally sat on the fast-forward button. I mean, how hard would it have been to add some sort of crossfade between scenes? Come on.

5. The ""Occlumency"" portion of the game is just plain laughable. I literally laughed out loud at how ridiculously simple and boring it was.

To sum up, clearly this game was rushed to market. It's frustrating to play, the game itself is a series of boring chores, and the ""rewards"" are nothing but self-serving videos of the actors and EA staff telling you how great the game is. It's nice having a bunch of DVD extras, but not for the price they're asking, and not for the price of 20+ hours of my time.

Another large portion of the game is managing upgrades, hiring\assigning various crew, and equipping your soldiers.
I initially enjoyed the game with the challenges of the turn based combat and permanent soldier death good incentives to think through encounters.  As your soldiers level they become much more powerful and unique.  However, when wounded in combat they will return to base after a successful mission and be unusable for several in-game days.  Unfortunately, the entire game is set against a backdrop of racing a turn-based countdown timer and frequent ""urgent"" missions that you can choose not to do but can suffer various penalties if you pass them up.  As time passes, the missions become more and more difficult and this is where the main issue lies.  With a couple of your high level soldiers wounded, completing missions becomes almost impossible leading to penalties and forcing you to try to wait out the clock so you can get your high level soldiers healed up and back  on the battle field.  However, you can get two to three urgent missions before they are healed so you end up with numerous penalties and missed rewards all while the overall game countdown timer ticks closer to game over and you've accomplished nothing.  It's a snowball effect that can loose you the game before you realize it.
It is definitely a game that lends itself to numerous saves and loadings as you try to work out the best way to get through a mission and it feels cheap having to resort to that.  But I promise after you have spent 6 hours leveling up a character, permanently losing them to couple of lucky shots by the AI will have you hitting reload as fast as you can.

I don't mean the review I'm writing to beat down this game.  It is an amazing game to be sure; from my somewhat limited experience with it, I can tell.  I absolutely loved the predecessor to Oblivion (Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind Game of the Year Edition) and was dying for the next sequel to come out.  I've been playing it for three weeks... or at least, I've been trying to.

I'm going to say it right away, as a warning; If you don't have a brand new computer with the newest specs, don't buy this game, at least not for your PC.  My computer is not 18 months old and cost me about $2,600, including an upgrade to the maximum two gigabytes of RAM, but according to Bethesda, the 1.6 gigahertz Pentium M processor I have will not allow me to play the game as it should be played.  I am incredibly frustrated.

I've been able to play enough to know that Oblivion is exactly what I was hoping for.  The graphics, if my computer had the ability to run everything effectively, are amazing.  My computer isn't fast enough to run everything as it should be run.  The sword my character carries flashes as I walk, blinking in and out of reality, which wouldn't ruin the game for me in itself, but everything slows down in the heat of battle and when there are multiple opponents, everything moves as if in cartoon frames.  Now I realize that there are points on the game map where everything on the screen locks and turns to white, and I lose control of play.

In short, I'd love, love, love this game if I had a brand new Dell XPS gaming system for $3,500+, but I don't.  Therefore, this game was pretty much a waste of $45.  Within the realm of Tamriel, I can't go to the places I need to go and do the things I need to do.  My computer locks up.
I can't express my frustration, knowing that this game, in its full glory, must be mind-blowing.

I wonder at what point the technological standards for games will not require up-to-the-instant-new supercomputers in order for them to be played?  I've just finished paying for the computer I have (a Dell Inspiron 8600 which I love).  I can't upgrade the whole motherboard.  And I certainly can't afford to purchase the kind of computer that would run this game...  Not after finally paying this one off.  AUGH!

By all means, if your computer is a thoroughbred, BUY THIS GAME.  It's going to be the game of the year again for certain and you will probably have several months of enjoyment with it.

If your computer is not a Ferrari, then steer clear of this game.  Your frustration will run deep.

*** UPDATE *** UPDATE *** UPDATE *** UPDATE *** UPDATE

Just after the online patch was made available, I downloaded it and installed it.  The above-mentioned problem was one shared with several users of this game, and I'm very happy to report that after the installation of the patch, the game runs very, very nicely on my computer.  I do not have the video settings set to maximum; not by a longshot; in my opinion, you still need a brand-new, loaded, $3,000+ computer, I think, to have Oblivion play at 100%.  With such a loaded computer, the game play of Oblivion must be absolutely amazing.

Now that I've installed the patch, I can go to all those areas which I wasn't able to previously.  The frustration of having the game lock up is no more, and I must say it's truly one heck of a ride, and I wish I could change the overall rating to at least 4-stars instead of two, but it seems that I am not able to do so.

I will go further and say that I've enjoyed the overall game so much more since the patch was installed that I've purchased all the online modules available for download on tne Oblivion website, and I encourage other Oblivion owners to go check it out.

After the patch, Oblivion is a great place to visit.

2.0,False,"05 22, 2013",A1KGQ2E9VNWVJO,B0016NRS8M,Tstops,"I love open world RPGs. I've played the gothic series, elder scrolls, dragons dogma, reckoning etc....and liked them all in some kind of way.  gothic had a dark and cruel world that made you start with a stick and a hut.  you really had to prove your worth to certain factions and it gave you a real sense of accomplishment if you could pull it off. Skyrim has a lush and beautiful world with amazing visuals and tight controls for combat that had you saying ""more more"". Dragons dogma had ground breaking deep combat never seen it an open world rpg that we've never seen before. What does two worlds two have? Not....much.
  It does have: bad controls, bad camera angles, crumby graphics, awful voice acting, weak story line, unbalanced questing, cumbersome inventory with a poor excuse for an interface and worst of all a combat system that will have you saying ""what in the....""  Over and over.
  The controls are the biggest problem with me because bad controls make for bad combat( at least on the console versions). The controls are just cumbersome and unresponsive. I can never do what I want to do. They had the right idea with mapping your abilities with x y b a but that's not the problem. The problem is, they thought it smart to make the sneak button the same as the run button.  jump is also the action button such as mounting a horse or opening a chest or character interaction etc... That makes for sloppy and awkward gameplay. ie I meant to sneak up on this guy but I ran right at him or I'm trying to talk to this dude but I keep jumping around him instead. WHY!?? This will cause you to shout obscenities you never thought possible and have your wife laughing at you(ok that was just me but you get the picture). And don't get me started on mounting a horse OH MY GOD! I mountin a horse in this game is like trying to give a girl a Cheerio as an engagement ring....it just doesn't work. In fact I can't think of one time I mounted my horse without incidents of jumping around it first.  Riding the horse is just as messed up. The trigger buttons make the horse go and stop. Any one who played skyrim red dead redemption or assassins will want to kill every horse they ride. It's so awkward.  The developers also thought it would be a really radical idea to put obstacles like fences and barrels in the middle of the roads you have to jump over. Surrreee, that sounds cool but the game is so random with the timing of the jumps that your lucky if you make it. I think it has something to do how bad the collision detection is in this game.
  This problem migrates into combat, which at first I liked until the horrible hit detection and unresponsive controls lurked its way into the combat. Switching weapons is as easy trying to round house chuck Norris. Just mash up on the d-pad a few times eventually it'll happen. Need to drink a potion mid-combat? No problem, just mash your right bumper a few hundred times till your dingus character feels like drinking it.
  And the worse part of combat is starting it. The game feels the need for you to draw your weapon.  I know sounds easy enough (skyrim did it, gothic did) however............ You have to press down on the d-pad again sounds easy right?  Well remember how I said its like trying to round house chuck Norris??  It's worse. You have to be standing perfectly still to draw your weapon problem is, if you get ambushed you natural instinct is to run and reposition yourself so drawing your weapon In combat is like try to round house the entire cast of the expendables........2.  It's just bad. I'm constantly fighting the controls in this game. Every step along the journey. Which had forced me to suspend gameplay.
  That's right.  No, I haven't beaten it yet. I will get back into it though,I always beat the games I get.
  As far as your character and story goes. It's sucks. I really can't think of anything else to say except that your character is extremely unlikable and a cheeseball voice acter,he just sucks.
  There aren't many pros to this game but it does have a really cool magic system.
The spells are 100% costumized and you can create some really cool spells. This system is something I hope more games in the genre start to copy cat. Look some up on YouTube it's really cool.
  I gave it 2 stars because it has a lot of content which is good and the magic system is really original and ground breaking. Other than that. This game is a puke magnet.",A dated and plagued game and end to a franchise,1369180800,3,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

The story really could have been great, but these terribly boring main characters ruin it.
The setting is fabulous and so are the enemies but the story is about finding your characters kid. If the story was similar to homefront I think it would have been amazing. Like I said the enemies are great. There's many varieties, many bosses, they look bad a** and they talk to one another in some crazy language.
And I love how the fighting area changes and you can be walking on the side of a building, facing down towards the streets shooting enemies, it's great
But the things tht ruin the game for me are these,
The sound is horrendous. Guns and explosions have no boom to them, it's just flat and voice acting is bland.
The graphics are outdated for a 2012 game. Explosions look terrible, guns look like plastic and the characters look bland.
Also the game feels like they wanted to imitate gears of war, but they failed. The cover system is slow, the controls are practically identical(besides reload is Y for some reason) and they even stole a gun from gears of war the retro lancer. The main gun in this game looks exactly like the retro lancer in gears, and even has a fricken bayonet.

The game play lacks the challenge and death penalties of the previous ones, but every game seems to be going that way, so I can't fault Blizzard too much on that as not every gamer is a hardcore gamer these days.  I have no complaints even about the DRM scheme as I'd much rather just be online (like I am 100% of the time anyway) then have some random DRM software installed on my machine.  I'll even let it slide that the physical DVD only contained a tiny .exe that just launches the downloader instead of having any content on it, as I got a cool stationary pad in the box ;)

The bad part though, is I have no clue how long I've spent actually installing this game.  Then after today, patching was a nightmare of the same problem.  Whatever torrent scheme they have running just seems to constantly fail at what it is doing or something.  It took hours to get to a point where I could actually download the files to play the game.

This was only accomplished by:
1) Downloading the blizzard agent/launcher from a 3rd party site and installing them manually by running it on a newly created windows user account on my computer that did not run as administrator
3) Switch that account to an administrator
4) Run the actual installer that was finally downloaded
5) Once downloaded, kill the installer/launcher/agent manually from task manager
6) Switch back to my normal user account and finally play it

It even sounds confusing to me when I go back and re-read it.  A normal (not tech savy) user would never be able to do this with instructions, much less figure it out on their own.

Is the game fun?  Sure, I like it.  Would I have bought it if I had any inkling of what it would take to get it installed/running/patched?  I can't say NO enough.  It just isn't worth it to play ""how to get it working this time"" every time a patch comes out.  I'm sure I am in the minority with this problem, but it shouldn't be a problem.

The idea for the game had tons of potential, the plot was fresh and the game play was going to be innovative. Unfortunately, due to an uneven difficulty spike and the worst controls I have used in recent memory, this game is ultimately a strike out.

The game centers around you, Alex Mercer, as a military experiment gone wrong who can morph his body into weapons. Think the terminator 2 villain but flesh blades and hammers instead of metal. Alex is trying to unravel the events that led up to his change since he has no memory of what happened until he woke up in a morgue. That's the gist of the back story, which isn't all that bad, it's just lacks some depth. But this isn't a plot review, it's all about the game play.

You begin with crazy powers like the ability to run up buildings, jump over entire city blocks and glide from rooftop to rooftop. All of Alex's abilities can be upgraded, allowing you to run faster, dash in mid air, and gain extra health. The problem is you will immediately feel like Alex controls like a Ferrari driven by a 12 year old. He makes wild turns if even the slightest flick of the joystick is made and it's very hard to plot where you want to land. Granted, with the right trigger held, you still continually run though streets and buildings with ease, but if it takes you twice as long to get where you're going, then who cares? The game also makes a huge difficulty spike about 10 missions in. Soon you get surrounded by tanks, helicopters firing machine guns, and tons of monsters/military who make your life miserable. There's not a whole lot you can do, as these people seem to be able to track you no matter where you go. So when the game says ""Fight or Flee,"" you have to fight. Side note, if you find it morally reprehensible to kill thousands of military personnel, then skip this game, the military are the bad guys.

It's not all terrible though, some of the side missions are fun especially the sneaking ones that have you go out and absorb people to gain new powers. It's fun to sneak up behind someone in a crowded military base and take them down quietly without anyone seeing you. Adds a lot of suspense to the experience.

In the end, the game feels rushed by Activision to compete with games like inFamous (much better in my opinion) and Crackdown (a lot more bang for your buck). It's muddled controls ruin what could have been an great gaming experience. If you can get it for $5 - $10 then it's worth a go.

The graphics for this game are so-so and kinda of glitchy -- for example, your characters sometimes walk through walls or other people. The game controls are difficult and make it very hard to complete missions. Kane ends up being more of a dead-weight instead of a helpful teammate. The game doesn't seem to be very realistic. It sometimes takes 5-7 shots to an enemy's head before he dies. Another frustrating thing is that there aren't many save points within the game, so you end up having to start over from the beginning of the scene whenever you die.

I have a Vita Slim, and have a silicone sleeve. I actually cut the sleeve up a bit to accommodate these grips since they add a little bulk to the analog sticks, only to have them fall off.

I played Age of Zombies (twin stick shooter) for about 40 minutes and both analog grips fell off three times during gameplay, not to mention that before they fall off they become loose, which really messes up gameplay because you can feel it happening.

I also applied the D-pad grip, and it doesn't even line up properly.

Unlike some other reviewers, I did get a matching set of each grip, so I guess that's good. I am frustrated because I think these would be perfect if they just fit properly. Now I feel like I'm $10 short with a bunch of useless rubber nubs and a sliced up silicone sleeve.

2.0,False,"09 9, 2014",A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B00CH9253W,T. Skylar,"Mario Party has always been one of my favourite and beloved  Nintendo franchise and Mario titles. As a child l'd spend hours playing the games alone or with friends. First on the Nintendo 64 and later on for the Gamecube (Mario Party 4 was the first game l purchased for the Gamecube) l even followed it loyally on the DS and the Wii. Those board-games used strategy, were pretty fun an featured the Mario characters we have all come to love, and it had one thing that set it apart: the mini-games. Alas it truly brings me no pleasure to write this review today. I am a Mario Party fan since inception and l don't make it a point of giving negative just for the fun of it. I really wanted, tried, to like Mario Party Island Tour for the 3DS but not to avail.

That's the sad part. Initially l had mild expectations for Mario Party lsland tour. I wasn't demanding much, simply a Mario Party game with boards, mini-games in that classic, familiar style that l could play on the go. Mario Party DS did an excellent job bringing the party to the portable consoles l thought. I assumed perhaps we'd get something similar. Not even close. It turns out all the negative reviews you read are in fact very much true. I so wanted to believe that they were wrong and that l'd be right. I was wrong, l should have listened to the fine Amazon reviewers and customers who gave this the thumbs down.

The main problem as has been addressed by many reviewers is with the boards. There are 7 boards total. Great right? Sounds like the usual more or less. Nope. The boards are not the traditional ones. You'll have very brief ones that can last ten minutes to twenty or a bit more. They'll put an approximate play length for every board but l find they exaggerate. The most l've gotten is probably a half hour, but it was more painful than decent. The boards are so small and there's hardly anything interesting or remotely fun about them. They feel like child games. Maybe that's what Nintendo was going for here, aiming this game at children. Sadly l don't think children would get much of a kick out of this game, they'd probably as bored as l was.

The goal now is for most boards to arrive first to the finish line. It's not about stars or money, it's basically only a race and a VERY brief one at that. You can gain power ups from winning mini-games and they add an extra dice, or multiply your dice roll, or make you move a specific number of spots. That's most of Island Tour right there.

You have to unlock boards as you go which is fine. Until you get to the last board. The seventh and final board can only be played multiplayer. That's right you need other people to be able to play it. If you ask me that's wrong. Now if it was a bonus extra, 8th map l'd be okay with that. But what Nintendo is doing is putting a plate of cookie in front of you that you can't eat. What's the point? Not that l care that much at this point since l haven't really enjoyed any aspect of the title.

Even Bowser's tower is repetitive and dreadful. It's not so bad to begin at least. All you do is climb a tower of 30 floors, on each floor you face Bowser's henchmen in a mini-game battle. All you have to do is win the game to get to the next floor. But then it turns out you get to the top of the tower basically for nothing and have to do it all over again. It's pointless because l feel no enjoyment, why do it again? You do unlock mini-games and other unlockables that don't serve any purpose (crystal balls with characters, events or map in them. Gee thanks l'm gonna stare at that a lot).

I feel obligated to mention the controls. It makes good use of the 3DS stylus and particularly it's joystick. The main flaw is the mini-games that require you to tilt the console for directions, aiming and such. It's painful to deal with and it does not function well at all. It's problem that they clearly didn't bother to deal with or maybe thought gamers wouldn't care.

Now the one good thing (yes it's not all bad folks) about Island Tour is the mini-games. They're not bad at all and most of them are really fun and can compete with any Mario Party title out there. It's just sad that the rest of the game makes it almost torture to play them. Some of the mini-games are actually very similar to previous MP games and some seem directly inspired or taken from them. It's a good mix of familiarity and freshness, l actually enjoyed quite a few of them. Yet mini-games aren't enough to redeem the rest of the game and sadly it doesn't take long to get all of them.

My advice is to skip this one altogether (unless you're like me and have to find out for yourself, if you do buy used) and pick up Mario Party for the regular DS. That's still the best portable Mario Party and it kept the spirit and fun of the N64 and Gamecube titles. It seems aimed more towards children and those who might not have played a MP game previously. Whatever the case may be, l feel Nintendo missed an opportunity here. Island Tour ends up being a very restricted and forgettable tour which is sad because both Mario Party and the 3DS deserved better. Certainly not worth full price. Avoid. 2 stars.","Mediocre tour, probably best to avoid this party altogether",1410220800,,,
2.0,True,"01 14, 2015",ANK0T96IHVBNM,B00JUI8HJ4,Truthful,"Adequate, but not great, and sure as hell not worthy of the Dragon Age mythos.

Dragon Age Origins wasn't just a superb game... it was an experience.  A near-perfect story-driven RPG.  Ever since Bioware sold their souls to EA, their products have been going downhill, and Dragon Age Inquisition is the latest example.

A shallow, straight-forward, largely no-frills main story (that for some reason, they changed the voice actor of the main villain for some stupid reason), with boatloads of empty, mind-numbing filler fetch quests masquerading as ""content.""  (NOTE:  the various side-quests in Origins added to the richness of the world and the player's immersion into it.  DAI's side-quests are mostly blatant, cynical filler.)
In pretty much every measurable or meaningful way, this game is inferior to Origins.

You only are allowed 8 powers/abilities at any one time.  <<< Read that sentence again.  There is almost no mage powers variation; you'll always play the first half of the game as an elemental mage.  There are no ""good vs evil"" dialogue choices or different ways (w/ related consequences) to solve quests.  No elves vs werewolves, dwarves vs golems, -type quest resolutions (or later consequences).  You can't add your own Attribute points; they are awarded via the powers/abilities you choose, as well as equipment.  This means there is almost no replay value, and no character role-play or individuation.  Yup.  It pretty much crapped on everything that BW and DAO used to be.

Even the large world somehow doesn't deliver, not like it should.  Remember the mysterious, archetypal, almost dream-like locations in DA:Origins?  Those are gone.  The open world of DAI is ok, but just doesn't somehow feel like it should have, coming from DAO.  (neither did DA2, with it's clean pre-rendered environments and cartoonish darkspawn)

Dragon Age Origins was dark, melancholy, and utterly serious.  DAI is forgettable and empty.

The AI is unbelievably bad.  It's almost as though your party is programmed to do the exact opposite of what a player would want them to do.  Ranged units move into damage areas, run into melee units, and NEVER follow the ""hold"" command.  Always love seeing my tanks go ""Bull Rush"" off in the opposite direction away from enemies.  GG BW.

And a whole lot of the items and/or powers flat out don't work.  (bleed damage is non functional, many items don't stack, or only work when properly equipped/removed/re-zoned, etc)

There is probably a bunch more problems, but don't want to waste any more time thinking of this game.  This $70 version was a ripoff.  EA offered it at regular price ~ 1 month after release.  TBH, this game almost barely qualifies as an RPG.  It really shows that Bioware has sold out.  Money grubbers.  After the blunders that were DA2 and SWTOR and now this, they won't get one more cent from me.

It seems like a game like Fallout 3 GOTY edition does everything DAI tries to do, only better.","Barely adequate as an RPG, an insult to the Dragon Age world.",1421193600,8,"{'Edition:': ' Deluxe', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

So when I saw the Just Dance 3 for Kinect I thought it would be just as fun. I think I was wrong. I know I don't have the most rhythm so maybe that doesn't help me but I didn't enjoy this one. I do have the Dance Central for Kinect and although I didn't do well with that one either that's why I thought the Just Dance would be better.

I didn't really like the characters that were pretty psychedelic. Plus, even though I was playing by myself I had four people on the screen on some songs. I found a single character was difficult enough for me so when they added four it seemed a lot more difficult to follow along. Especially, when they'd start doing different moves. I'm not 100% sure, but I think I could pick which character to follow and even if I switched midway through a move it seemed to count it in most cases.

I think as my husband was clicking through the menus for me he seemed to find where I could have the song broken down which would have been helpful but I'm not really sure how he got to that screen.

OK, I'm just gonna be real blunt here, and call it like I see it...This game is weak! It's not even CLOSE to a 5-Star Rating.

Let me start by saying that I really like the COD series of games, but, this one just didn't do it for me. This game is pretty weak. They could have made this great.

Great graphics and all, but, that doesn't make a great game...

My first gripe starts with the story line...It just jumps ALL OVER the place! My God, you can't keep track of what the heck is going on....One minute you're in Vietnam, the next minute you're in a Russian prison, the next minute you're fighting Germans, then you're fighting in the present, then you go back to 1963.....Kinda stupid if you ask me.

Second gripe: VERY LITTLE game play...
Now, what game play there is, is very cool & pretty realistic, but, there's just WAY TOO MANY cut-scenes, and movies, and you can't override them, you just have to sit there for eternity until the scenes are done....I could make a steak dinner waiting for these cut-scenes...Cut-scene is done, then you play maybe 5 minutes worth of game, and you're right back into ANOTHER cut-scene! OH JOY!

In my opinion, there's too much ""fluff & filler"" and not enough game-play. I'd rather watch a movie, than play this game.

Furthermore units are so small that they often are barely noticeble unless you zoom all the way in, meaning battles will often look rather silly, like tiny specs of animated color shooting at one another.

 Although the maps are huge, and I mean huge, the space given within the maps is uneccassery at best. the armies often comrpise no more than 100 units per side, and given the units tiny size, this does not require a great deal of space. So what is all the space for? Frankly, I have no idea.

While yes, it is possible ot give a group of units very complex orders via the shift key system in place, these orders take a bit of time to issue, even when you are very eperinced with the system, meaning online play, which in RTS game is fast paced by nature, becomes rather difficult to pull off.

This is quite possibly the worst game I have played in quite some time, and definitely the ONLY one I have EVER played where the best boss strategy was--wait for it--standing directly in front of the boss and mashing the ""A"" button. I mashed my way through 5 hours of this game, people, and I even beat one of the bosses while eating a sandwich and not fully turning back toward the screen until I heard the myrrh tree music. Make no mistake, this is no incredible feat on my part: this game is really that stupid.

In addition to the incredibly low level of challenge (god, was this game marketed for 10-year-olds? Then you shouldn't have put the FF title on it, Nintendo/SE!), I haven't seen a game this repetitive since Pacman. You heard me. It's as repetitive as an arcade game - only it was RELEASED IN 2004. This is truly a development that should put Square Enix to shame. All you do, per level, is wheel around in your crystal caravan, watching 10-second cutscenes at random, and fight your way through three levels (of your choice) til you fill your chalice with myrrh. W.O.W. Each level honestly takes fewer than 10 minutes, so you will probably complete a chapter in all of 30. What do you do for the next chapter, you ask? Does the plot advance? The answer is NO. You do the SAME DARN THING. AGAIN. After a few chapters pass, you even have the option of going back to the levels you have already visited. Gosh. What an EXCITING idea.

The ONLY cool things about this game--and believe me, I really mean this part--are graphics, which are beautiful, and character customization, though that is of course minimal. But compared to the rest of the game, I don't know, I guess I'll take anything.

Yet another complaint of mine is the rotating camera angle. For GOOD games, this isn't a problem, and your typical gamer would be hard put to find a situation in which it was actually a bad thing. But in FFCC, unlike most [good] RPGs, the game is MAPLESS - so don't you dare wander around in a town you aren't familiar with, or else you'll be running in circles forever due to the rotating camera that makes it impossible to tell which way you just came from--because you are -always- facing a different direction. I'm sure I've actually spent longer wandering stupidly in pointless towns where the townsfolk tell you parts of a story you aren't privy to than I've spent fighting bosses. Navigating was certainly more DIFFICULT, that's for sure.

As for the Analog Sticks and the Triggers I read some bad and good reviews, I would say the Analog Sticks sensitivity and precision is way above good I would say it is a professional series item, but I have a really big disappointment with the quality, it started tearing off on the second day of use, it took me 1 year to wear off the standard MS controller analog stick, with he Razer OP it took me 2 days and it's already suffering use tear problems. As for the trigger, it is really uncomfortable specially the LT one, the RT I feel it is ok and just took some getting used to, the LT one not only it is uncomfortable but when used, it makes the game (BF3 as reference and LA Noire) unstable and does not work properly, it would randomly do other actions. The 2 configurable buttons work great but I do not feel it adds any PROS nor CONS , yes you can add another button for ease of use, but it won't let you program macros, so it is just a placement thing. I ended up programing the LT to the extra L button because it did not cause the LT in game behavior problem.

As far as recommending this product, I would say the concept is good, the analogue sticks sensitivity and precession is off the charts amazing but the CONS are more than the PROS in my opinion which makes the MS controller a more viable option by far.",Razer Onza Pro Gaming Controller,1330905600,,{'Edition:': ' Standard Edition'},

Meaning that any new movie updates after Finding Dory won't happen. They admitted it was not a financial success after losing $140 million plus over the past quarter.

This review is based solely on the game itself without expansion packs. I would assume it's much more enjoyable with those, although they failed to mention you should start by buying the expansion pack/play set to really enjoy it. I will also say I was able to get the game for $5 on the Playstation Store when it had its E3 sale.

Essentially, it's a tutorial the entire time. You go to areas and ""practice"" skills that will help you later on. It get old very fast. Plus, each figure has to be upgraded individually. The upgrades do not transfer, meaning every time you switch, you have to start over. And there's a little bit of lag to the character movement on occasion. And you can't switch between figures on the base or in game. You actually have to replace the figure in the slot if you want a different experience.

This game is basically Disney saying how can we drain your wallet. The figures aren't cheap to buy (anywhere from $7 to $20 individually on Amazon) and some of the ""play set expansion packs"" are $40+. One of the Star Wars expansions can cost you $90, granted it comes with 6-7 figures.

2.0,False,"11 12, 2012",AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B002ADD6WO,Aiex Halo,"I am brand new to this style of strategy game; I stared in abject horror at the huge list of tutorials for Victoria 2 and Europa Universalis III, and it took me months just to begin to get a handle of the game's demands.  But once I did, I decided to turn to this one, since it covered the ancient world I loved.

Primarily, first and foremost, most importantly, etcetera, the game suffers from seemingly random crashes that utterly ruin the game for me; some 20 years into my campaign, it will freeze at the exact same date, and no amount of prior saves will fix this problem, so any other complaints are largely superfluous to a positive gaming experience compared to this.

Next, to the superfluous details:

It would make sense for this to have less adaptive/selection features than Europa Universalis III, to reflect a more primitive form of government (be it the monarchies of the Hellenistic Kingdoms, or the Republics of Rome and Carthage), but it becomes a severe deficiency when Rome in 200 BC has no access to horses anywhere in Italy, and is totally unable to research technologies to enable higher forms of infantry/cavalry, or boost research speed in particular fields (Army, Navy, Government, Stability, etc) and just hope that the game will randomly decide to grant you access to better military units.  It was stunning how I was unable to build ANYTHING at the start of my campaign because NOTHING was researched yet---even temples, of which Rome had many by 280 BC (when the game lets you start), are unavailable anywhere, and if some random event destroys your only temple in Rome, you cannot rebuild it for years and years until the ""technology"" is randomly granted to you.

As well, the military aspect.  Given the time period of this game, a nation's military virtually encompassed the nation's attention; there were no standards of civility by which a nation would surrender with honor to another, and especially with Rome, which would annex any lands that couldn't resist or offer a good reason not to.  Despite this, no extra attention or emphasis is given to the military in this game compared to EU3.

Worse, there is LESS emphasis---you cannot adjust your military/naval prestige or attention, and there's essentially NOTHING to distinguish the military capacities of different nations (ie, Rome having lightly trained, but zealous legionaries, Carthage having expensive veteran mercenaries, the Hellenistic Kingdoms having a solid, steadfast professional army).

This means it is the NORM for a Roman army of 20,000 Principes (because there are no Hastati or Triarii available) to lose FOUR OR FIVE TIMES IN A ROW to a Gallic Barbarian army of 4,000 or less.  Anyone with even a token knowledge of the Roman military would know that the EXACT OPPOSITE is true throughout virtually all of Roman history; the average Roman soldier was much better trained, better equipped, and better led than the average ""barbarian"" of virtually any of the ""barbarian"" tribes; Scythian, Gallic, German, Persian, African, Asian, etcetera.

This leads directly to another complaint; barbarians.  Unlike EU3 where you could risk colonization of any province regardless of its natives, here, it is IMPOSSIBLE to colonize ANY land if the barbarians are considered ""too strong"", and the barbarians are ALWAYS ""too strong"", without fail.  Rather than being able to invade with an actual army, the only solution for this is to basically lure the barbarians out by recruiting a single unit of military forces, and waiting months and months for the barbarians to rise up, kill them, and sack one of your settlements.

From there, the barbarian mechanic just goes completely off the edge; barbarians rise up in random numbers, and if the initial rise isn't quickly quashed by a nearby army, more and more of them spawn out of nowhere, or rise up from completely different provinces.  Combined with their anachronistic ability to easily crush a Roman army 10 times their size, and any attempts at colonization without two fully stacked armies nearby will pretty much end your game in total defeat.

As well, little consideration seems to be given in the historical bookmark dates.  Despite letting you start the game at major points between 280 BC and 27 BC, the game doesn't seem to care much to consider the actual political/military factors in place during these times.  For example; starting as Epirus in 280 BC will place you with your army in Epirus, and NO fleet available to you, meaning you have to wait a full year or more just to transport your army across the little gulf between Tarentum and Epirus.  Similarly, starting as Rome in 218 BC will see Carthage start with a full navy bigger than yours---despite the fact that one of the terms of the First Punic War was that Carthage's navy was severely limited by Rome, which would subsequently use its navy to prevent Carthage from doing anything to hurt Rome, hence the whole reason for Hannibal's marching through Gaul and over the Alps.  Here, he didn't need to do that; Carthage's navy easily quashed mine, then invaded Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica within a single year.

Apparently new to the game via the ""Vae Victis"" expansion is the implementation of the new and advanced Senate feature.  A better case for a tyranny I have never seen in any video game set in ancient Rome.  The two major Republics are Rome and Carthage, and virtually nothing is done to differentiate the two---there is only one Consul/one Shofet per year (historically there were two; this was a very big deal to exclude in this game), and you can appoint two Censors (or Elders for the Carthaginians) who appear to do absolutely nothing.  Laws passed by the Carthaginian Republic inexplicably have Roman names (Lex Cornelia, etcetera).

Historically, the Roman armies were commanded by the Consuls for the year.  In this game, there is absolutely no attempt to replicate this chaotic situation at all; there is no automatic-installation of the Consul to your biggest army, nor any indication that they should assume command as per their station, and given the abysmal loyalty that seems default amongst the prominent Senators, forcing an army commander to resign after a single year will guarantee that they revolt against you.

The ""party"" system is simplified, with there basically being only five or six major parties (Military, Populist, Religious, Mercantile, Civic, etcetera), with the only defining marks being that the Populists are the most evil, self-destructive party in the entire game.  Their primary features when in power is INCREASING your risk of revolts and DECREASING your stability.  How in the hell this makes any sense is entirely lost to me, and I have never seen more revolutions over a 50 year period as Rome since the Crisis of the Third Century AD in real life history.  It's beyond belief that this sort of game mechanic would be considered anything short of a colossal screw-up.

As well, Senate-based pop-ups seemed solely designed to ruin your life as much as possible.  There was indeed great political maneuvering amongst members of the Senate to gain power, but the effects that occur in game are exaggerated to such a degree that the relatively stable political environment of the mid-Republic looks more like the Civil Wars of Caesar and Pompey; the Senate DEMANDS you install Lucius Diddlypuss as governor of Magna Graecia, you accept, he's IMMEDIATELY A REBELLIOUS LITTLE TWIT CONSIDERING INDEPENDENCE.  NO EXCEPTION.  If you don't waste money bribing him or waste titles appointing him an Augur or a Pontifex, he will revolt, guaranteed.

Long time One Piece fan here and let me say, reviews like this fooled me into thinking this was a great game for my fanatical side. It is not, despite its attempt at fan service this game is repetitive, its lazy, its so non-linear, and of course coming from bandai/namco its a polished piece of turd with a license slapped on it so it seems okay. I had a MUCH better One Piece experience from Pirate Warriors 2 over this, the only thing this has over pirate warriors 2 is the visuals. And that's it.

The open areas are hardly that open and secret areas need a special character to unlock and those characters can't unlock said secret/secret area without a word(s) found to give them the ability. This was one of the stupidest things I've ever dealt with. For example: You play as Zoro who we all know master of three swords, cutting through enemies and making tornadoes (by the way the dragon twister in this game looks epic but its pitiful how little damage it does and how fast it vanishes) yet come to a steel gate that he's supposed to cut, oop can't do it because he needs this item or whatever that is a word(s) to give him the ability to cut a gate WHEN HE'S BEEN DOING NOTHING BUT CUTTING THROUGH STEEL FOR YEARS!

Still not convince this is bad? The animation though somewhat smooth and I do like the visuals. But everyone moves way too slow, like what the hell? Are they all training on a Kai's planet or something? Did they forget how to walk?

To play the game, you must have and maintain a highspeed internet connection.  Everything in ""your game"" -- your data, your gear, your characters -- is actually Blizzard's, parked on one of their servers.  While the rationale for doing this varies and includes everything from stopping piracy to blocking mods/hacking and making money off the ""auction house"", the outcome is the same:  you don't own this game or even any substantial part of it.  All you own is a key that lets you in to visit the game, so long as Blizzard feels like keeping its servers up and maintaining ""your"" characters and data during your prescribed visiting hours.  As many have already discovered, they don't feel like doing that particularly well.

This situation has been a long time coming.  Years ago, in what is now obviously a faded golden age of gaming, you actually owned the game you bought.  Subject to at most perhaps an annoying CD security key, you still at least had a physical object that you could carry around and load into other physical objects whenever you felt like, enjoying the game for as many years as you want and anywhere you want without requiring pre-approval from the company's massive cloud computing Death Star.  Somehow, us gamers let that time get away from us.  Starcraft II was the most recent warning, when people discovered that much of the functionality of Starcraft had actually disappeared and live internet was required even for single player campaigns (which also were initially missing 2 of the 3 playable races included in Starcraft 1 by default).  People got upset, but not upset enough to make a difference.  Perhaps things have changed now.

The simple fact is that we are going backwards in game design even as technology improves.  Diablo III is a pathetic shell compared to Diablo II.  Like a divorced parent, you have to count the moments until you can visit your characters for a little while, and then get kicked back out the door the moment your visitation window ends.

Ayumi is the scantily clad eye-candy heroine of Blades of Time, a fantasy action, hack `n slash adventure.  There is a completely inane storyline about Ayumi arriving on a mysterious island called Dragonland, rich in treasure but naturally fraught with peril. No previous adventurer has ever returned from Dragonland...naturally.  Of course it's never quite that simple and Ayumi finds herself caught up in a battle between factions who are fighting for control of the land.

Despite some large environments to explore Blades of Time is fairly linear which honestly I don't have a problem with.  The next areas won't open until you've met your objective in the current area.  A quick press of the d-pad will bring up a compass to point you in the direction of your next objective so you need not ever worry about getting lost or knowing where to go next.  The compass will also provide hints to the locations of treasure chests where you can find upgraded weapons and firearms or various other battle perks.

A standard skill tree is provided which allows you to expend your earned experience points to buy a wide variety of power-ups including magical attacks.  These include an almost overwhelming set of combo attacks.  Earning a new combo transports you to an arena to practice your new combo which isn't very realistic but is helpful.  The problem is, and you've likely heard me say this over and over again, is that there are so many combos that its simply not easy to remember them all and even if you do, many don't have any greater effect on the battlefield than your standard attacks so likely you'll find a few attacks that you like and stick with those.

Combat is just ok.  The schemes are fine but there isn't the gritty feel that you get with so many other similar games and the effects of combat are also boring and mundane.  Between battles the game features numerous platforming and puzzle solving sections. The platforming sections are made needlessly difficult and frustrating due to a lousy camera view.  This often leads to you falling to your death. Fortunately checkpoints are quite frequent, but that doesn't make it any less annoying and if there's anything I hate in a game its frustration and annoyance being used as a substitute for challenging level design.

Blades of Time's key feature is the ability to allow Ayumi to rewind time.  Now this isn't like Prince of Persia Sands of Time where you could rewind to recover from falling to your doom, but rather it's a battle aid.  You can run up, attack a foe several times with your sword, and then hit the rewind button.  This creates a clone of Ayumi who will then mimic the moves you just did...in this case you now have the Ayumi clone attacking the enemy along with the true Ayumi.  The one caveat is that if you rewind time it not only affects Ayumi but the enemy as well.  This if you're fighting a boss, his health meter will go back to what it was when you rewound time.  So in a sense you're giving a boost to the enemy as well.  Kind of stupid if you ask me...and it makes for more careful use of the power.  Add to that the fact that health is always in short supply and boss battles become a chore.

It's clear that developers Gaijin Entertainment spent most of the design budget on Ayumi.  She looks good and has a ton of animations.  But none of the character models look nearly as good.

Like before, if you die you don't get back the healing leaves you use.  So with each defeat you get weaker and weaker.  Soon you will run out of leaves and have nothing to buy more of them with.

The original Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 game is a masterpiece for the most part... but this DLC? not so much... The DLC adds a new boss battle,new playable character, 100 battle challenge mode, some enhanced visuals and some unlockable images.. and that's it.. not really worth it and i'll tell you why..
the Challenge missions are fun, and what you'll spend most of your time with since it's the only new content that takes time to beat.

The ""New Chapter"" is misleading.. it's not a new chapter it's just an impossible to win, complete unfair, frustraing boss battle with you playing as Itachi and Sasuke against the Sage Mode form of Kabuto. Kabuto has 2 battles.. the first one is winnable but the second  he has  5, yes 5 health bars! that take little damage which drags the battle out for a while. If you fail, and you will fail.. every time.. you can have to restart the battle at the second part of the battle where he gains his 5 health bars, but the difficulty remains the same, instead of of being lowered so you can win it like in the other boss battles from the original Naruto Shippuden UNS 3 game did... essentially, not matter how good you get.. the boss battle isn't winnable and is extremely frustrating..

The ""HD Visuals"" that were supposedly enhanced for the Burst DLC  aren't a mixture of visuals that only look slightly better, some blurry ones that actually look worse the the original's graphics, and ones that looks the same and were untouched.

The only other good thing about the DLC besides the Challenge missions is the ""new"" character Sage Mode Kabuto ( i say ""new"" because he could have had sage mode as an awakened form (and probably did at some point in the game's production before it was presumably was put on hold in order to make more money and release it as DLC) he is a good new character.. but $10 for one character and some quick challenge missions isn't really worth it.. even if you get the retail version which includes the all the DLC costumes it still isn't worth it since the costumes are just cosmetic.

 So to recap.. one new character. an impossible, frustrating boss battle. partially enhanced ( and partially worse) visuals, new challenge mode for $10 is a rip off big time.. don't bother getting the DLC unless you just want Sage Mode Kabuto are willing to pay $10 for one character..",Interesting DLC but not worth it,1391904000,2,{'Platform:': ' Sony Playstation 3'},

2.0,False,"03 25, 2011",A288S7I52880CZ,B0047TG2R0,mkllby,"I don't know where to start here. There are some pretty vast improvements in Dragon Age 2 (DA:2) compared to Origins (DA:O). Improvements I actually enjoyed and which I feel deserve praise. Namely the combat is far superior in DA:2. The strategy of the more turned-based style combat like in DA:O is still fully intact, but without the turn-based delay. It does give it a more hack-and-slash feel, but that is deceiving as the strategy and ""special attacks"" are still key components. I actually found myself needing to think and analyze a little more through some battles in this game as compared to the original.

  Unfortunately, I also have some qualms with the combat in this game. While it does require you to be a bit quicker in reacting in some cases after a while every battle starts to feel the same. This is because enemies level up as you do, and every battle is comprised of enemies of the essentially the same set of attributes as the previous enemies. To clarify take walking through the city at night when you first arrive in Kirkwall, by this time you are probably around level 5. You will be swarmed with around 10 enemies which range in two classes, ones with health bars it takes you 3 hits to completely kill (or one hit using a special attack playing as a rogue) or ones it takes about 10 hits to kill. Well at level 20 plus the same type of enemies will attack you and because they level with you it takes the same amount of hits to kill one enemy. So using the exact same strategy you worked out in the first few hours of the game you breeze through almost every fight and your 500th fight seems just like a carbon copy of your first fight. It gets pretty monotonous after a while and boring to the point you start hoping you won't even run into any enemies.

  The graphics in this game are beautiful. DA:O's were decent, but far from beautiful really. I

  That unfortunately is where my list of improvements ends. Though even that wouldn't be bad IF other elements of the game were even at least close to being on par with DA:O. Here my biggest gripe is the story...or should I say lack thereof. Obviously a story of sorts is being told in this game, but it lacks one key element, literary conflict. Literary conflict is used no matter what type of story being told from comedy to drama to horror to drive the plot forward. DA:2 has virtually none. What this leaves you with is a game full of rather meaningless tasks to complete to get from one point to the next. I actually thought I would hate the narrative story telling they chose to do here, but that part worked, was done well and was the high point of the game's lacking story. So it isn't that they decided to tell a story in a different way from Bioware's typical format that I disliked, it was that there was no real story.

  Don't get me wrong there is story of sorts here and it is supposed to be about the role you played in lead up to the mage uprising/rebellion. But this is not really built upon in any real way to create literary conflict in a build up to the crescendo of events of the game's finale. Apart from the last few hours of play the whole mage thing really just seems like an annoying component to the game. What I mean is there is an obvious conflict with the mages being mentioned throughout the game, but I am not given any reason to care either way about it and to be honest I really didn't and still don't care about it. That is where the literary conflict is missing. Nothing is built into the overall story to make me care about it and the first two ""acts"" of the game aren't even dealing with this issue in any way except to have mages and mage-haters whining incessantly.

  Then there is the ""world"" itself. You will explore every inch of every part of the ""world"" in this game in the first 5 to 6 hours, then you'll spend the next 30 or so hours bouncing back and forth back and forth between these same 10 or so, rather small areas. Each area is VERY small, and I am not sure why this is. I mean you can literally go through the entire map of an area (minus the time for battles and/or conversations of course) in around a minute. Therefore you are going to set through hundred and hundreds of fairly long load screens. This becomes almost unbearable given there feels like there is no real point (because of the lack of any real conflict in the story) for you even playing the game. I mean I was glued to the screen playing DA:O. I lamented that I had to work as I couldn't wait to get to the next point in the game, but at the same time not wanting it to end. Playing this game I seriously couldn't wait for it to be over and had this not been a Bioware game and had I not been one of the biggest Bioware fanboys of all time I wouldn't have even been able to finish this game. I seriously had no desire to even play it really after the first few hours.

  Even to talk to your companions you have to go to each one's ""home"" and talk to them there. So you have to sit through even more load screens just to interact with and they all a different ""home"" except for two being in the same place. At least Mass Effect had everone on the same ship (base), even if you had to go to each one's room to speak with them. I also think the companion's in this game lack any real depth to them. It is more about having them there solely for quests. Before I felt a connection to them and actually got giddy at the cameos from my DA:O companions, but the companions in this one don't seem to be interesting but definitely have more quests but no depth of character. I did a lot of running around and killing for these guys but could careless about any of them really (though Isabella is one of the hottest video game characters of all time in my opinion). They weren't that interesting and neither was any of their stories and could've cared less about battling and killing some of them in the end. They meant nothing to me, where as I couldn't finish my DA:O play through when Anora had Alistair executed when I wanted to make her queen.

  I don't know what Bioware was thinking here, but this whole game seems amateurish compared their known ability in crafting an excellent story and characters. I seriously would not have finished this game had it not been a Bioware game and even being a Bioware fanboy I can't give this game even a decent mediocre rating. Without a doubt the core reason for this is because of the incomplete story that lacks the main ingredient of any story...conflict. Without conflict the story doesn't move forward and I think Bioware thought they could get away with this because the narration would be used to push the story forward in between ""actb"", but seriously that fell flat and failed miserably. Even with narration the story itself must have and build upon the conflict and that just doesn't happen at all with this game and therefore it becomes tedious and outright boring to play especially with the repetitiveness of the battles, continual repeats of the same areas being used/visited and seemingly endless load screens that must be endured. As a Bioware fanboy I must admit this game is honestly borderline unplayable and is definitely not a game that has any replay value at all. DA went from epic with Origins to boring and virtually unplayable in this installment.

2.0,False,"06 13, 2002",A3VE7FK9QDWJVU,B000063RRN,Vano Chu,"I really wanted to like this game, but ended up returning it after a few days of gameplay. Since other reviewers have gone over the good points, I'll just highlight the bad points that killed it for me:
1. There's only one save file allowed and this file is erased as soon as you start playing. Maybe the designers did this to emphasize the ""story"" or ""seriousness"" aspect of the game, but it prevents you from saving at a decision point in the game and efficiently checking out the what-if's. I didn't have the patience to play ALL the way through the same point over an over to find out how things change based on my answer to the 4th question in a conversation late in story. And especially not when it takes me a good 30-40 minutes of walking through mostly-empty environments punctuated by careful combat to get to that point.
2. When you die, the swords you took with you from your warehouse go away permanently. The game boasts something like 20 different swords with 400 possible moves among them. Great. But are you going to take your best life-enhancing, attack/defense-maxed swords into the story with you knowing you'll lose them if your character dies before reaching one of the story endings? (Note: there's at least one path that leads to premature death and it's not in combat, so you have no chance if you make the wrong decision). Also, losing the sword means losing all the advanced moves you've learned for it. If you start the game with another sword of the same type, you are forced to unlock the moves all over again! Like the save-game system, this seems like an arbitrary obstacle to really exploring the depth and richness of the game because it forces you to be very conservative about your choices. They should have made the sword skills part of the character instead of attaching them to the specific swords to encourage people to try out the other weapons. It's a painful choice: you don't take your best, well-used sword for fear you might lose it and you don't take a new fancy-schmancy sword you just got because you don't know any moves for it and you'll get killed (and lose the sword) by the first grunt. What's that leave? Well, I got very, very good at using the basic moves of the default sword....
3. You can't skip or fast-forward the dialog scenes. Let's face it, by the time you're trying to hunt down that last elusive story path, you'll have read the same dialog bubbles a hundred times. Since they don't change and some of them take a loooong time to unspool, you'll be futilely mashing buttons to try to get them to go faster. The inarticulate grunts that were inserted in place of actual speech don't make these passages any more palatable. I figure they account for about 10 minutes of inactivity during any given 30-40 minute playthrough of the story. Given that you'll have to play the story many many many times to get all the story arcs and sword skills, that adds up to a lot of wasted hours.
Too bad. There are a lot of cool story arcs and side-plots in Way of the Samurai and much replay potential in perfecting one's sword combat with each weapon. BUT, the game designers seem to have done everything possible to _discourage_ you from exploring the game. If your idea of ""finishing"" this type of game was to get all the story endings and all the swords with all the moves, then be prepared for a long, tedious journey that has purposely been made much more frustrating than it has to be.",Fun for a couple of days only,1023926400,6,,

The Uncharted series has a reputation for incredible storytelling and mind-blowing setpieces. As a huge fan of the second and third games, I'm sad to say that this first entry does NOT do the series justice. In fact, this might even be one of Naughty Dog's worst games. Here's my review:

Story: 5/5
As Nathan Drake, you and 2 others travel to an island to find El Dorado, a large treasure that the Spanish and Francis Drake, your ancestor, were after. Using Francis Drake's journal, you'll attempt to find this famous gold statue while surviving the onslaught of men who are also after it. This is a well-written story filled with memorable characters, both good and evil. Here, you'll find mystery, plot twists, and everything else that makes a story superb.

Setting: 5/5
The island you'll spend your time on is well-designed, but don't think that since it's a jungle setting, you'll stare at trees the whole time. You'll ride a jet ski upriver, wander through catacombs, and solve indoor puzzles in addition to taking in the sights of the jungle. There's a wealth of visual variety to be had here. With all the effort put into this island, you might even begin to think this is a real place.

Gameplay: 2/5
----Combat----
At its core, Uncharted is a shooter. And as much as I enjoy my occasional shooter games, I thought this huge aspect of Uncharted was an enormous failure. You will gun down HUNDREDS of enemies that the game throws at you by the truckload! It's completely outrageous! When there are 7 waves of enemies in the SAME area, it really shows poor design. Granted, the enemy AI is admirable. These guys will run to the side of your cover, lob grenades at you, and move in ways to avoid gunfire. But cover shooting grows terribly old after engaging in your 500th encounter. You literally cannot go 3 minutes without facing enemies 90% of the time. I only wish that were an exaggeration. At least you get a hefty variety of weapons to wreak havoc with.
----Puzzle Solving/Platforming----
Compared to the rest of the game, puzzle solving plays a very minimal role. Off the top of my head, I can remember 4 large puzzles, 3 of which were basically mimicking what you see from pages in Drake's journal. That's right: no thought whatsoever. I did, though, appreciate the incredibly smooth climbing mechanic; leaping from ledge to ledge is nice and effortless.

Objectives: 2/5
The game is split into 21 chapters that are easily replayable from the main menu. There is of course, your main objective the whole time. This is a linear game, with the only thing to do on the side being treasure collecting. I just didn't find any importance in doing so though. The game doesn't give an introduction to treasures or even explain why you're collecting them in the first place. But essentially collecting treasures and performing other tasks earns you Medal Points used to modify gameplay. You can tweak the game by enabling Fast Motion, Slow Motion, or even select any weapon at any time. Again, though, there's no feeling of significance in treasure hunting. Why should I care what the name or appearance of my treasure is? Bottom line: You'll come to this game for it's main objective and nothing else; treasures are NOT fun to find.

Overall: 2.5/5
It's disappointing that a game with such a stellar story has to be marred by an over-reliance on gunplay, mixed with mindless puzzles. Treasure hunting feels pointless, so all you'll ever want to do is advance the storyline, taking in the genuinely interesting scenery as you go. If you've yet to jump into the Uncharted series, I'd say go for the later entries, or pick this up cautiously, knowing that the most you'll get out of it is story.",A bad start to a great series,1370217600,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

But at the end of the day, after playing this game I realize it was all hyped and false advertising.  It is an average game on par with games like Warhammer Online and Rift.

The starting experience is good, there are events and quests going on around you and they feel different.  However, about about 20 levels they get extremely repetitive and stale.  It is basically the same event, reskinned over and over and over again.  If you are out solo or in a small group the questing is completely different experience, it sucks.  The questing is only good in huge groups where you zerg things.  If you don't mobs respawn rapidly and you will miss most of the events.

The PvP which is what the game was supposed to focus on is horrible and the worst implementation of PvP I have seen in a PvP focused MMO.  The sPvP maps are all the same with the same objective, there is no dept or change in gameplay modes.  It is doing the same thing over and over and over again.  There is no capture the flag or domination or king of the hill etc.  It is domination over and over again.

WvW is fun for the first couple of hours especially in guild groups but eventually you realize you are beating on doors and running around 80% of the time.

Combat and camera control is a weak point.  The combat is clunky and heavy with lack of responsiveness.  The combat has no dept, you learn all your weapon skills quickly and combat is basically bashing abilities that are off cooldown which makes for a mind numbing skill-less system.

Easily the weakest point of this MMO is the endgame.  It has none.  You can buy the best gear in the game with gold and you won't have anything to do.  You can spam the 8 dungeons that feel horrible without healers and tanks or you can do WvW and that is all there is.

The reviews don't lie.  5-6 hours tops and you are done.  ZERO replay-ability whatsoever.  Also, half the game is cut scenes (most of them pointless and unnecessarily long) so if you got it new it was $60 for 3 hours worth of game play.  The ""fight"" scenes are a joke because you basically just hide behind cover and pop up like a whack-a-mole to shoot and go back into cover.  EVERY gun fight is like this.  The are so many useless objects too.  I lost count of how many old random family portraits I picked up that do NOTHING for the game.  Just look at a picture.  That's it.  Lycan fights are also lame.  The literally run at you, you dodge, they run right back where they came from and do it again.  And the two ""epic"" Lycan fights don't let you fight.

Shirley,"I am a huge Alien(s) and Predator fan, I loved the original films, and could say that Aliens vs. Predator 2 on PC is the end of FPS games for me.  I felt the game mechanics of that PC game were top notch, graphics great for their day, and the multiplayer lobby server as well at online matches were out standing.

When I heard this game was being made on the Next Gen workhorse consoles I was very excited but skeptical due to my fondness of the original, baring that Jaguar and Arcade games,  AvP games on PC. Sadly my skepticism was correct for me.  I find the game mechanics of this new AvP to be choppy, sluggish, and unpolished.  The graphics are lacking. The sound is spot on tough. The online gaming is frustrating due to the fact that the lobby server is not an active search that lists multiple matches and allow you to pick one as the PC games did.  Instead this one picks a game, and does not give you much control there after.

This being said my biggest problem with this game is that fact that I did not find it to be fun at all.  Alien melee is a bit random compared to the previous games as is the melee of the Predator.  Predators also start out with only wrist blades in multiplayer.  The Aliens wall crawling ability is somewhat disorienting and frustrating with the ""transitioning"".  Marines kick @$$, in terms of their weapons, exactly what you'd want in a Colonial Marine.  However, some of the odd camera movements when climbing on or over things can be frustrating at first as well.

Either way, I was disappointed and really hope they release a patch to fix some of the issues.  But I won't know since I traded it back in already. lol","I loved the 2 PC AvPs, but this one left me wanting...",1267747200,2,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",
2.0,False,"08 21, 2003",A150OWFGFIQF4C,B00006JZXR,Tessera,"""EverQuest: Planes Of Power"" was obviously designed to cater to ""Uber-Guilds,"" an expression used in the EverQuest online community to denote player guilds which are rather advanced in skills and prior experience, and large in numbers. The single adventurer, as well as the casual gamer or relative newcomer, will find little to no content whatsoever which is available to them in this expansion pack (past a certain point). It is all about groups and large scale raids. Solo gameplay in the ""Planes of Power"" zones is next to impossible, and that is appparently by design. In fact, several player class abilities were ""nerfed"" by Sony just prior to the release of this expansion, ostensibly to ""better balance the classes."" It is far more likely that those ""nerfs"" were enacted to prevent any possibility of traditional solo classes (such as Wizards and Druids) from being able to do any effective soloing in the new zones.
Another problematic feature of this add-on is the overpowered ""gear"" that one can obtain from the high-end encounters featured in ""PoP."" Introducing too much ""uber gear"" to an MMORPG game is precisely what ultimately ruined ""Diablo 2"" when the ""Lord of Destruction"" expansion was released. For many gamers, the focus becomes shifted away from roleplaying and game content, and instead toward greed for items which they can strut and show off to other players. It also tends to make player characters who *can* manage to obtain those items a bit too powerful, which hardly seems to fit in with Sony's highly questionable assertions... that several prior ability nerfs were done to ""better balance the classes."" If anything is true about ""Planes of Power,"" it's that it is decidely UN-balanced in the extreme.
Painfully short on game content, all too few and sloppily written quests, overly lengthy encounters and a generally poor payoff in the ""Plane of Time"" endzone are what one can expect from this mediocre expansion pack. Whilst it is a ""must have"" for all EverQuest players, it hardly stacks up well against prior expansions such as ""Scars Of Velious"" or ""Shadows Of Luclin"" so far as actual depth, atmosphere and overall content is concerned. This is also the first EverQuest expansion set which the original game designers (Verant International) had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with, and it shows. Moreover, ""Planes Of Power"" is an expansion pack which 99% of all players will never see the bulk of, due to their being unable to assemble the ""muscle"" required to fully explore the additional zones and adversaries. Not being able to see three quarters of a game you pay for is rather disappointing (to say the least), so unless you already belong to a highly-skilled player guild, do not expect to progress past a very superficial point in this add-on to EverQuest.
Lastly, ""The Planes Of Power"" tends to look and play more like a Sony PlayStation 2 game than an add-on for a classic PC based MMORPG. Storyline depth and roleplaying content has been replaced in favour of eye candy, overpowered enemies, and ridiculously and unnecessarily overpowered items designed to appeal to player egos. ""PoP"" is not entirely without merit, but depending on what you look for in a roleplaying game, you may be disappointed overall. Defenders of this add-on have often said to me  ""Well, Sony knows what sells, that's why PoP is the way it is, and that's the bottom line."" Naturally, I have no problem with manufacturers of PC games making a profit on their merchandise, but I see no reason why profits and product integrity need be mutually exclusive concepts.

First of all, I live in Kuwait where pirated copies are only a few bucks and you find them everywhere. But I respect the time and effort put into the game, so I ordered it from outside. Original are hard to get in Kuwait. I received a box with plain two CDs without a proper pack or even a manual. Its like when you receive a free CD with a magazine. Thats really a shame for a start.

Second, I started playing the game and not so impressed with the graphics resolution and neither the animation. But thats OK I said, its kinda old game perhaps. The mysterious story may be the good thing about it. The cursor itself, environment movement, and overall playing experience is one of the worst I have faced in adventure games.

Third, the unlimited bugs who are seeming to be more difficult to beat than the game it self. I am only in the second chapter and this is the second time I am forced to repeat from an old save. The first save for some reason is not loading. The second time I moved on, I got stock somewhere where I can only move my cursor, and can click nowehere else. i.e., I have to close and repeat.

Despite our all hopes, it seems adventure gaming ages are really over. I rarely accept any single hint in an adventure game, but with this one, I already started reading hints just to move on and see where I end up... and then there was the bug that stopped me.

Of course, you've probably heard by now how bad the Werehog levels are. Yes, they are THAT bad. In fact, they are so bad, they pretty much warrant most of this entire score. What's so bad about them though, isn't how lame, corny and repetitive the melee combat is. It's how HORRIBLE Werehog Sonic moves. He's not just slow compared to Sonic, he's just slow, period. He can't even really jump. And the levels are based around fighting hundreds of monsters, and the worst part, doing miss-it-or-die acrobatic stunts with Werehog Sonic. They are SO frustrating! Near controller breaking frustrating! Like, he's supposed to cling onto a ledge or pole, but half the time, it doesn't work! Not having any kind of depth perception whatsoever in the game doesn't help, either. Oh, and he can die from a six foot or more drop, as I learned. The clock tower climb in the Spagonia night level was pure torture. But then again, all of the Werehog levels are. Oh, and the night levels are roughly 15 to 20 minutes long! More than twice as long as the Sonic day levels! Seriously, who thought it'd be fun to make you play as this slow-moving Werehog having to do numerous death stunts when most of the time, he either never clings on to what he's supposed to, or you'll only get a split second to do so. The overworld stuff isn't really fun, either. Just busy work, honestly. The plot is so-so for a Sonic game and I like the idea of an Earth-like world to explore, with similar to real life countries. But overall, outside of the Sonic levels, the game is just tedious, frustating, and a chore to play. Even some of the Sonic levels (like godawful Holoska) are a pain in the you-know-what. All in all, this game is frustating, feels like a chore to play every time, and is almost never fun when you're not speeding through a Sonic day level.

The Xbox 360 wireless controllers are great, but being wireless, you are going to need a battery for them.  While are first glance it seems logical to get the battery pack built for the controller by Xbox itself, it is ultimately an unnecessary expense.  If you buy this battery pack then you also need to buy the special charging station for it.  This charging station can charge two battery packs at a time, but only the Xbox battery packs, it doesn't charge anything else.  You would be saving both time and money to instead invest in a set of normal AA rechargeable batteries and a normal battery charger which will not only charge faster, but also give you batteries that be be used in other electronic devices.

After reading the reviews I settled on the Ripjaws MX780.  I Was pleased when I first received the mouse.  It is very well constructed with reasonable weight and a high quality feel.  The features were strong and the software is easy to navigate.  The finger buttons and mouse wheel have an excellent tactile feel.

The reason I have given this mouse three stars is that despite all of those positive features, there is just one horrible, unforgivable design flaw which makes this mouse almost unusable for gaming.  It almost makes you think that the designers never even really tried to use the mouse themselves.  It has to do with the thumb buttons.  First of all, having average sized hands they are just about too far forward to even reach with the thumb while using a comfortable grip, and they are not adjustable.  Even worse than that, they are designed to sit UNDER the left mouse button, which hangs out over them.  There are about 2-3 mm between the side of the left mouse button and the thumb buttons underneath, which both feel the same.  As such, in order to hit the thumb buttons you have to tuck your thumb under the left mouse button and push in sideways at an awkward angle to trigger it.  Whoever overlooked this issue ruined an otherwise perfectly good mouse.  I also do not like the fact that the only way to change dpi settings is to cycle forward through all 5 settings, rather than a toggle which can go forward and backwards, like the RAT mice have.  The only visual indicator of dpi change is a color led change, which means you have to memorize which color corresponds to a certain dpi in order to make changes effectively.
This makes it extremely difficult to change DPI on the fly while gaming.

Anyway, overall even though it has many excellent features, I conclude that this mouse is a fail for gaming and I would advise that you try other options until this major issue is fixed.

5/10: adding one more problem to the list.  In Windows 7 if you switch users you lose connectivity and have to unplug and re-plug the mouse for it to start working again.

First of all, I don't understand how NHL, Tiger and FIFA are usually consistently pretty darn good. But basketball hasn't really been consistent since the PS2 and early XBOX days.  I can honestly say I'm disappointed with 14. A big Live advocate for years, I was excited. New developer with Tiburon and those trailers looked really nice. But I was worried that there was no gameplay videos before launch. Now I guess we know.

ut I can't get over how slow and overall sluggish the game is. And you can't adjust it? Where is the game speed sliders? Or any sliders for that matter? THERE ARE NONE! The PG taking it up court actually looks nice, but things go awry when you pass half court.  It's very robotic, and not organic at all. Players sometimes don't appear to react, they hunch over, stand around like half awake zombies. Post game is okay, you can pull out some nice moves, but it's still a bit slow and wonky.  Shooting jumpers seems impossible at times and even on rookie, the computer seems to swish every single shot it attempts.

 Atmosphere is okay, but I actually think Live 07, 08, 09, and 10 played smoother than this. And less glitchy too. Sometimes players just stand around and don't move. A.I, leaves guys wide open and you can dunk with a PG over dwight howard pretty much at will from what I saw.  Dunking can be fun and fun to watch, but again, the game plays so dang slow, it's hard to ignore this. Players look just fair, if you google NBA Live 06 graphics, the player models on Live 06 actually look better than NBA Live 14! They didn't even get Lebron right? Where's his beard?  The redeeming features are the amount of things and modes it has. But with a broken game on the court, I'm in no way going to play this over 2K. 2k is the only b'ball game you'll ever need.

It's also handy for arcade-y titles and MacMAME, the emulator of  classic arcade video games.
The one place Gravis makes a change is very  much for the worse -- the four separate directional buttons are replaced by  a single pivoting directional-pad.  As too often happens with designs like  this, the D-pad pushes two switches at once, and ALWAYS comes through as a  diagonal (eg, right + up, when you thought you were just pushing right).  The frequent inability to enter a true right, left, up, or down is annoying  in some games, particularly in navigating the menus of an RPG, and deadly  in others (PSX ""Asteroids"" is unplayable when rotating your ship  sometimes inadvertantly puts you into hyperspace, since that's what  ""up"" does).
Also of note is the fact that this controller works  only with games written to use Apple's ""InputSprockets"".  That's  true of most late 90's / early 2000's games, but not of some earlier titles  (""Descent"", which used to be bundled with Mac Performas, comes to  mind), and it's not clear if Sprockets will be supported in the upcoming  Mac OS X.
That said, driver installation is easy and has been hassle-free  on my two iMacs and my iBook.  USB plug-and-play almost always works  without a snap, though I've found it's better to plug it in once the Finder  is up instead of during the boot cycle.

Also companions disappear thus you die.  The game frame rate is beginning to stutter badly during intense high number of enemies attacks. Microsoft tried to help but they can only fix Xbox related issues.  This is a developer (Undead Labs) issue I was told.  The developer has no or very poor support system.  They just try to pawn you back off to Microsoft.  I have no choice but to wait for bug fixes that I am unsure if they even know exist or give up and sell it.  So far they have only fixed small issues that had no game ending effects as these 2 do.  Oh and of course they added downloadable pay content.  Not so sure it was even worth the 30 (now 20) bucks since we got basically a beta.

Update (7-21):  There are posts that say a patch has been out since July 3 called 2.1 but I have yet to find it and it does not install when loading the game on Xbox like all others do.  2.0 did.
Update:(7-22)  Guess there was a stealth update because all of a sudden the supply issue is resolved.  Disappearing follower issue is still very present though.  Game is playable like this but only if you don't mind dying.
Another thing is why do I seem to be the only one complaining about this when there a suppose to be 3 million users of this game?
Update (8-12)  They are stealthily fixing some things while breaking many others.
Right now zombies are spawning within solid objects.  They can not be interacted with so infestations can not be cleared.
Also mission persons are not where they are suppose to be to further the missions.  They talk but are not there and can not be interacted with.  This again makes the game UNPLAYABLE.
There are many others issues but they do not make the game unplayable like the others mentioned.
Also the vehicles that you drive are no longer visible on the map so they are easy to loose at night.
Update (8-30)  Well at least it is getting worse.  Right now I am at my base with 6 residents and none of them are anywhere to be found.  None of the prior entry bugs have been fixed.  Game seems to be flaky in just about every way.  Can't rely on much of anything to work all the time and if it does it does so in a flaky way.
Update:  (9-13-18) Characters/companions issue has been poorly fixed because now they just get lost or stuck (sometimes on the car roof) instead of disappearing altogether.  Weird things are happening all over the game like smashing into invisible walls in the middle of the road.  And an issue that has always been is those barns with the metal pole fences/gates where you bump into empty spaces and can't get through to the interior.  Open gates are not open in effect.  Also all characters seem to run into invisible walls all over the place.  The currently driven car not on the radar issue is still in effect.  Real easy to loose your vehicle at night.  I would characterize the game as totally unpolished.  Many times your companion will just stand there while you are getting killed.  Only thing the companion does extraordinarily well is get between you and the enemy when you are trying to shoot the enemy.  The follower will go to great lengths to do so too to the point of jumping in front of your face. What's up with that?  I could go on and on and maybe I will once the bugs are reduced to a manageable amount.  Also why can the enemy attack you while you are changing weapon but you can not attack them back or even move at all.  Developers keep saying you should think of the game as real because you do things the way they would happen in real life but boy do they need to practice what they preach.
10-2-18  Still no current vehicle tracking.  On the disappearing follower issue, they have digressed.  Now the follower can sometimes not even reappear if you restart the game.  Impenetrable barn/stall gates issue still there.  One stall even has loot that can not be gotten because it is behind a should be easy to jump gate and an open gate that acts like a solid wall.  Sometimes if you are near any other object trying to hit a zombie is impossible as it just swings through them.  Creatures still meld with solid objects.  Followers still get stuck on car roofs and other things.  Changing characters can many times cause you to spawn far away.

**But before I talk about that. If you are lazy and don't want to read a lot, my review and advice is to wait 6 months until this game has been patched up and some expansions have been released before you buy it!**

1. The game is clearly bare bones. It is missing simple structures and features. For example it is missing a subway system. This is standard for any big city. Especially since the map sizes are so small, space is a premium. It's missing a lot of variety on utilities. Water pumping has two choices, trash one choice. Why? It is very clear, EA wants to charge you for expansion packs later. Just look at the Sims 3, they are still releasing expansion packs for that game, and they are $30 a piece. I hate EA!

2. Bugs, glitches, etc. Nothing works right after you get into the more advanced economics of your city. In the beginning building a city and filling up the map works fine, but when you get into the fine tuning of trading and resources in the advanced stages, you are screwed. Below is a list of problems I've come across:

-Buying water or exporting sewage to other cities works for a few days then suddenly stops.

-Trading (Exporting/importing) works sometimes then suddenly stops for no reason. This will quickly bankrupt your city if you aren't paying attention.

-Gifting money to other cities, works sometimes and then sometimes your money disappears!!

-When you start in a new region with only one city, you can export anything and import anything from some magical place not on the map. But once you have other regions setup that magical place is gone, and you can now only import and export what the other regions has.

-Exporting the same product from two regions causes trading to stop. (Example: I had one region exporting alloy, things were going smoothly but when I set a second city to export alloy as well, all alloy trading stopped.)

-Great Works DO NOT WORK!!!! This is really annoying. I set to build an Arcology. It requires TV's, Metal and Alloy for stage 1. I have a city that produces all 3 of those and is making millions of simoleons a day. I set this city to send those resources to build the Arcology.

Game play is basically the same as in the first Ben 10 game, you unlock more aliens and moves as you progress through the story line. This game has a more 3d look that the first Ben 10 game that had more of a cartoon feel.

Pros:
-The ability to attack by moving and waving the wiimote and nunchuck is great for younger kids who won't be able to do the button combinations for all the moves.
-Actual voices from the show, lots of video scenes to watch
-Ben 10 fans (kids) probably won't notice the huge game play issues.

Cons:
-The biggest problem is that the game is just horribly buggy. Especially in 2 player mode.  Camera tracking is bad, interaction between objects is poor (can fall through floors, float in the air on nothing, die and come back over open pits and just die in a loop) When my son and I play I will join in to get past some harder areas and with the bugs in game play you simply can't complete the game in 2 player mode all the way through.
-Compared to the first Ben 10 game, it seems like it is way too short and just ends in the middle of the story line.
-Level selection is just a text list and is missing the map feature of the first game.

If you have to choose a Ben 10 game to play, Ben 10 Protector of the Earth is a better choice, or maybe wait until the new Ben 10 Alien Force Vilgax Attacks comes out the end of October 2009.",Doesn't anyone debug or test games any more?,1251590400,2,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii'},

*Update*
About a year later, the D-pad broke in half from frequent use. Turns out it's made of cheap plastic and will break easily when you play a game that uses the D-pad often. I didn't notice this at first since most games use it rather sparingly, but it's something to look out for.

Additionally, the charge gave out completely around the same time and the pad won't work unless it's plugged in. I operated it as intended, where I would fully charge it then play with it until the charge was gone, full charge, repeat. I also never played with it plugged in and fully charged as this would have a negative effect on the battery life, so I'm not sure what happened.

The plastic swivel connectors on the cups (which seem unnecessary anyway) simply do not hold up under regular use.  They last about a year, and then one of them snaps, leaving the cup dangling and the headphones useless.

I have no complaint with the sound from these headphones -- the quality is good.  I have some trouble getting them to always work right with Windows 7, because they incorporate both a headphone and speaker component, the combination of which sends Microsoft's sound software into a tailspin, but that's hardly the fault of Turtle Beach.  Any problems are generally quickly resolved.

If you're going to purchase these headphones, I recommend doing so from an outlet that will give you a two-year replacement policy.  Trust me, it will be money well spent.  Alternately, opt for Tritton or Razer products, which I understand have greater durability (Razer seems to manufacture the moving parts of most of their headsets from metal, which seems like a good plan).  For my part, Turtle Beach products have just proven too disposable for me to ever purchase them again.

EDIT: In the process of packing my PX22s up for return today, I discovered that they had also broken on the other side, the headband slide cracking in the fashion to which some other reviewers have called attention.  The swivel on the other side was also showing the white signs of plastic stress.

That said, this is a very generic MMO and poor excuse for a final fantasy game.

Having played Final Fantasy 13, which came out years ago, I knew what Square Enix was capable of in terms of presentation. I was hoping for incredible voice-acted cutscenes. I was disappointed. The cutscenes look like early playstation games and its accompanied by a wall of text. Don't get me wrong, I love reading and my favorite final fantasies are 7 and 8 which require a TON of reading. But this game just didn't have a compelling narrative. And again, the cutscenes were SO underwhelming.

I also feel like the Heads Up Display is a copy and pasted version of World of Warcraft. Sure, its a HUD and it works, but it feels recycled. Even the way you go about quests - kill 3 birds, gather stuff - feels a lot like any other mundane quest in any other MMO. I found myself mindlessly clicking through them after a while. I didn't care about the characters giving me the quests or completing the monotonous tasks they required.

The class/job system is definitely a strength of this game. I like that you can essentially switch classes whenever you want. Unfortunately, I just can't see myself playing this game long enough to unlock them and diversify my character. The community also seemed to be thriving. I saw players in every zone enjoying the FATE battle system (a glorified zerg in one particular portion of the map).

If you like the MMO formula the way it is, this game might just work for you. It features incredibly familiar design elements and if you're even somewhat experienced, you'll be able to dive in head first. If you were hoping for something revolutionary or groundbreaking and set in an awe-inspiring Final Fantasy world, you might be left disappointed.

To my defense, I have friends playing this game and they were really looking forward to me playing with them. And vice versa. I tried to like this game and I will continue to like final fantasy. I just don't particularly care for this rendition.

Single player is a mess. Controls are not user-friendly and are limited. Graphics look like a game from 2008. And action sequences and explosions are pretty lackluster. The checkpoint system blows. What's the point in providing checkpoints if I have to start at the beginning because I stopped playing in the middle of a mission? Shouldn't I be able to load to my last checkpoint. There's one mission where I have to escort and keep alive 2 soldiers that I can't give commands to. My question is why do 2 fully able soldiers (not injured in any way) need to be escorted? Shouldn't they help fight and protect their self?

Multiplayer is pointless. Poor graphics makes it hard to see the maps clearly. Characters look blurry, especially if aiming from a distance. Scopes like the reflex seem kinda like a disadvantage, mostly because it's not a smooth transition when drawing your aim up. Spawning is crap. If a few guys get into your spawn, expect to be abused for the remainder of the match. And probably worst of it to me, online just seems like a frag party.

- the simple audio hook up of the transmitter to the XBOX 360 console does not work with HDMI only connections. To make a long story short:
My 63"" plasma is built into a home theater wall. The xbox is hardwired to it via HDMI. I would think this is VERY common since HDMI is the best possible quality AND the fewest cables. In order to make this puppy work I have to now use the ANALOG XBOX cable octopus and put that to my TV OR hardwire the X3 transmitter via my wall to my TV out. That's just silly and poorly thought out. The issue here is that you're running unnecessary cables for just this headset.

- the sound comes with lots of white noise / hiss. Certainly not fit for 100$ headphones. You have to control this with multiple(!) dials on different components.

- There is absolutely NO spatial / surround effect. I.e. you play COD and have no idea if someone is coming from behind. For 100$ no 5.1.... I guess I should have read the description better instead of assuming it but again, for that kinda money it should be included.

I know I wasn't going to expect Madden or the fast pace even of a ""Dawn of War"" during the Blitz mode of this game.  Unfortunately, I find this game somewhat lacking and slow...yes readers, even slower than a tabletop game of Blood Bowl.  I get the turn based mode, which is very true to the tabletop version, but even then it seems to chug slowly uphill in comparison.

Pros:  - True to the tabletop in the ""classic"" mode in terms of rules
  - 8 teams to choose from (this is good and bad...good for the diversity, bad because the tabletop has 15 teams)

Cons: - The game seems somewhat slow
  - Graphics are Xbox quality, NOT 360
  - ""Tutorial"" mode is a complete joke and basically useless, could've been better thought out
  - The commentators SUCK, as in the worst I've heard in ANY game...I pretty much tune them out...at times I forget there even are any, that's how innane and worthless they are
  - There are constant grammatical and spelling errors...SERIOUSLY!  Did they not edit this???
  - Since the tutorial is so pathetic it's easy to get lost early on...the learning curve is pretty bad.  If you have the tabletop version, the rules are actually the same...reading this will go farther than just the manual.  (e.g. Ok, so fouling can get a player kicked off the field...the manual says it can, not why, while the tabletop guide says why and how)
  - Each turn has a time limit...when I pressed the XBOX GUIDE button to pause the game, i noticed the clock in the background still ticking down!  Really???  Yes, there is a pause button, but by going to the GUIDE, it should automatically pause like any other game.
  - You can't change team colors.  Yes, I know, this isn't Madden, but some more team customization would've been nice, since the tabletop allows you to design a team from scratch.  I'm surprised some of this element didn't carry over.

So, overall, if you're a tabletop fan with no one to play with, this is a way to play on your own or online, albeit with issues.  I really did want to like this game and was excited, but I honestly feel let down, even at the $49 pricetag.

2.0,False,"06 11, 2012",A6BHE6E9VV5BE,B00178630A,Nishi,"After picking up the annual pass last year, I was looking forward to playing this game. I haven't played the previous Diablo games and the only game I have played in this genre are the untold legends psp games (Guardian FTW) so I will just be basing this review on the game itself and not comparing it to the previous games.

Story:

The game takes place 20 years after the events of Diablo 2 an evil is back at it again. I really liked the story, and the cut-scenes were amazing to watch (especially act 1's end scene). You get a CGI cut-scene at the end of each act bringing you into the next. Throughout the course of each act you are given a drawn cut-scenes explaining what's happening so far with the hero you picked voicing it over.
My favorite part of the story though is being able to talk to all the important NPC's. The main characters have new topics to talk about each act, and even get new things to mention based on the quests you're on and what events have taken place. You can also talk to the Blacksmith and Jewel crafter; they even have dialog options before you obtained them when you play new game+.

Gameplay:

This is where the game is both really cool, but really annoying at the same time. The combat itself is really fun, and all the runes are mostly different from one another that make leveling quite fun. Basically you earn skills as you level, and the skills can be modified with runes (1 at a time for each skill) so your barbarian whirlwind could be on fire, or shoot smaller tornadoes from yourself. With elective mode you can put any skill on 1-4 numbers and left/right clicking.

With that said, you start being forced into a few builds in order to survive in inferno difficulty. To me this goes against the tons of variations you can choose from (Yes this is the hardest difficulty, but it was still something promised before the game came out). The skills can be reset at any time during the game, which really removes the reason to even level the same class again if you don't care about Achievements.

Also it seems that act 2+ in Inferno is one big gear check. Normally I wouldn't mind this, especially in game like this where gear is king, but they have stated that the existence of the Auction House factored in the op rate of items (Since people would use the auction house to buy better gear, instead of farming it). That worried me a bit after hearing that since the Real Money Auction House is coming out soon, and if they are getting $1.00 per sold equipment and 15% on commodities, and if you transfer to paypal its 15% on top of everything else. Makes me wonder if that was the main reason the Auction House was factored in.

Another big issue that is a no-no for me is always on DRM. That means you need to log into the game to play, and no offline mode to play by yourself. So if the server goes down for maintenance, too many people logging on at once, or even server lag is all a factor in the game you purchased. Also for something that requires you to be connected the whole time, you would thing matchmaking for public games would be better, but it's not. Most of the time you are put into a game with just one other person and there is no kick option for people who want to grief you. I'm surprised they couldn't have it send you into games with more people since they are able to code LFR and LFD in WoW, or they could just have a game list for people to join.

Now onto exploration, it was advertised to have randomized maps, but this is only partially true. The map itself stays the same every time and only events are randomized (Like a cellar door open on time leading to a dungeon, which could be closed the next map reset). This makes playing through the acts multiple times tedious after a while, especially if you want multiple hero's in Inferno.

Soundtrack:

The soundtrack is pretty cool and adds to the feel of epicness that you can slay tons of enemies to. The main theme is really epic and by far my favorite. You can tell they took their time with the soundtrack to make sure it was up to par with mainstream games. The soundtrack changes based on the theme of each act you visit.
The sound effects of the weapons and attacks are really polished. From the Monks Daibo spinning to the barbarians leap sound great and don't seem they are just stock attack sounds. The voice acting in this game is ok, not the best in the world, but it works. The jeweler acting though is pretty awesome and is the most memorable for me.

Graphics:

I think they did a really good job with the graphics. I like the look of each hero and their abilities, and with the different runes for the skills the looks change and most look diverse from one another. Each act has its own look, from the graveyard to the desert. They are really well designed visually and the first time through them is pretty awesome.

Verdict:

The game itself is pretty fun the first few times through (Cool story, great soundtrack and nice graphics), but it does get tedious after a while without a real randomization to the maps and not just events. Throw in the fact the game has to be connected all the time to the servers could lead to many annoying moments with server overload or lag, I recommend saving your 60 dollars until they iron out all these issues.

This game has ZERO co-op of any kind. No ""survival"" mode, and even the MI6 missions aren't co-op. They don't even have any bots. So they want you to spend 60 bucks to get a game that offers none of the features of some of the other games that are out right now.

It takes some practice to do this, as right after you enter the slow motion ""bullet time"" -- it lasts just a few seconds -- you have to lock each target, shoot, lock the next target, shoot, repeat.  It's easier said than done, hampered by the stupid in-game camera, which often messes up your game.  The camera is insanely stupid at time, which is why I give this game only 2 stars.  It's really very poorly implemented on the PSP, which has a small, cramped-feeing control pad to start with.

The other reason for the two star rating is the game is ridiculously short.  Just rent it from Blockbuster (which, BTW, lets you keep a game or video for up to two weeks) and I bet you can finish it in a day or two.

You can't just run from room to room either, you must defeat every single enemy that comes pouring into the room to shoot you, stab you, bite you, kill you, club you and run you over. There are literally 1000s of enemies per room making this game is probably one of the most impossible games ever! Before you get excited about this game, you view an overhead perspective of the room you are in, rather than a 1st person perspective. A nice feature of this game is with the SNES is that you use the buttons to shoot north (X), west (Y), south (B) and east (A) while your player runs in a different direction than you are shooting. This is also a very nice two player simultaneous game, for either competing against friends or teaming up with them. If you love intensity, impossible odds, shooting through never ending waves of enemies this is a great game!

2.0,True,"08 12, 2011",AJN24TVEGZEI4,B000935256,Steve,"Ok, so I bought Soul Calibur 3 after buying and absolutely disliking Soul Calibur 2, so therefore I guess it reasons that my disappointment with this game is my own fault.

First I am going to start off with the good aspects.  The game is beautifully crafted, the backgrounds are absolutely magnificent, the characters are beautifully developed and the graphics and frame rates are by all token beyond amazing.  When the characters are fight they are flawless, their moves, combat and actions are seamless and there is not a skip or a frame miss between them.  The backgrounds are much more developed than in SC2, and they even allow you to manipulate the scenery, for instance if a fighter hits a wall it will break ect.  Next the game is filled to the hilt with tons of extras, tons of mini games, and you are able to buy and absolute plethora of weapons, armor and items, almost mirroring the final fantasy series in a great way.  Lastly the music isn't bad and the story line is pretty good too although it an get convoluted at times.  Finally, I absolutely love that you can build your own character, but I hate that you are relegated to the weapons and moves that the dictator computer forces on you.

Now for the negatives which unfortunately far outweigh the positives.  As amazing and as wonderful as the above aspects are, they really don't make the game fun, and for me a video game needs to be fun for me to enjoy it, it needs to entertain me, not give me rage and frustrate my like this game does.  My contention with this game comes in the following areas.

(1) The games difficulty is absolutely ridiculous and is not made with common gamers in mind.  I am not serious about video games, I play them to pass the time or on my train commute, but this game is developed for serious gamers and this is clearly reflected in the lack of difficulty settings.  No, ""easy"" mode or ""medium"" for guys like me, only hard for the fan boys.

(2)The AI is completely unbalanced.  One stage is super easy, the next one is super hard, than followed by easy and so forth in a random order.  This is angering when I am getting my butt handed to me in the first stage because I got stuck against a genius AI.  At least with MK the game gets harder as you progress, and as you get better, this is completely random.  Also how the hell can a massive behomoth such as Asteroth deal tiny amounts of damage, but a little shrimpy girl like Taki can deal mass amounts of damage and over whelm you?  Yea, someone is a feminist!

(3)Like in SC2, the computer can pull of these ridiculous moves that you can not even dream of pulling off.  When you get stuck fighting against a hard AI, the computer will have you bouncing in the air for 6 or 7 hits with 3/4 of your life gone before you even know what happened to you.  The computer will block you every 20 seconds and you won't get a good hit in at all, and it will pull off a counter every 3 seconds as is the same with breaking your grabs, but you as the player can forget about any of that, the probability of you timing it right is 1/1,000,000.

(4) Who ever designed the characters, clearly had favorites in mind and was by all means close to being a feminist.  All of the female characters are far better than the male characters, are far faster, stronger, more elegant and the computer works their AI much better.  Also when fighting Mitsarugi's AI, he was clearly a favorite of the developers as his fighter wether it is your first or 10th fight is unbeatable and is insanely hard to beat.

(5) What the hell, they got rid of all of the great charatcter moves and replaced them with boring moves.  For instance, Ivy cant swing her sword/whip around any more with the L2 button, instead she just stabs.. BORING.. On the upside Taki has a good move where she stabs the ground, with L2 so i guess the got rid of great moves and added some good ones.. Leave the great ones and add more great ones! Also, some of the fighter's outfits are just plain dumb, I think they were better fashioned in SC2.  Asteroth looked better in SC2, as did Taki (I hate her mask).

(6) Chronicles of the sword is so dumb, childish and pointless.  I hated the weapon master in SC2 because of its difficulty, but this puts it to shame, makes me love WM.

(7) This game is all about practice.  If you have the time to practice and play for 8 hrs a day like a good fan boy should than you will have no problem mastering the moves and combos.  But if you are like me and you are getting a degree, working and conducting a personal life, you can forget about getting anywhere in the game.

(8) The memory card currupts if you save another game after playing Chron of the Sword.  This is kind of idiotic considering that I really don't feel like paying for 2 memory cards just to have an entire card for one game that genuinely dislike.

I gave this game an additional star becuase its good aspects are phenominal.  Unfortunately none of the good parts make the game enjoyable or fun.  This game is so hard and so frustrating that you will either put it down in a minute or you will toss your controller out the window in sheer rage.  If you have time to invest in practice and all that BS buy this game, but don't buy into the little fan boys and girls about how great this game is.  If you are like me and are a suckie,  casual gamer, this game is not for you, if you are a great gamer.. go for it.

It seemed to begin well. I thought that it would begin like FF7 where you're in a gigantic metropolis for some time and end up in an expansive world. I expected the cliched cheezy and overly dramatic characters, I expected under-dog protagonists versus some empire. I also expected changes and liberties with the battle system. But I did not expect that they slapped a Final Fantasy title on a linear dungeon crawler! This isn't a Final Fantasy, it's something else. Yeah the graphics are great and whatever, as if that can make up for this game's horribleness.
The fighting was repetitive. You die if the command character, who you don't seem to be able to change, dies. Where's the spells? I was learning all these spells from that crystal thing, but I couldn't use them with my character.
I hated the linear structure of the game. What were they thinking? It's not an RPG. Why go this route, why not experiment with a more non-linear FF? There was no exploring. No towns, no fighting and replenishing in towns to build up the characters.
As the dungeons continued and I began to wonder if there was any world to explore, I ceased caring about the characters or the story whatsoever. There were way too many cut scenes. It was more like a movie where you had to do some RPG like activities to see the next scene.
I returned this game the next day after playing over ten hours of it. It's a shame. I haven't found any J-RPG's that can compare to FF4,6,7,8, chronotrigger, or xenogears.

Upon it's release a week or so ago, I drooled over the hardware specs and jumped up and down about the possibility of replacing my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roku-3-Streaming-Media-Player-2014-model/dp/B00BGGDVOO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roku 3 Streaming Media Player (2014 model)</a>&nbsp;and Xbox 360.  Plus, the ability to cast and mirror from my Nexus 5 phone and link to the stuff in my Google account was just gravy.  Alas, it was not to be.  I'm assuming the problem is that I jumped on this too early.  NVIDIA is still trying to work out the bugs, kinks, and lacks.  So, here's a list of my current issues with it:

- No Amazon Apps:  That's right.  As of this writing, there are no Amazon apps officially available for this.  Yes.  You can sideload a few of them.  But, they either just don't work, or work miserably (lack of controller support).  This is an absolute killer for me.  My primary reason for buying this Shield was to replace my Roku 3.  Yes.  I can use the Google Play Movies & TV app to watch the few movies I've bought through the Google Play Store.  But, the vast majority of my media is right here on Amazon.  Without an Amazon Instant Video app (and it can't even be sideloaded), the Shield has lost most of it glamour.

- USB Keyboards and Mice Don't Work:  There's a thread on this over in the NVIDIA Shield forums.  I don't know if the Shield has a problem with ALL USB keyboards and mice.  But, my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Logitech-Mk560-Wireless-Wave-Combo-Plus-K351-Keyboard-M705-Wireless-Mouse/dp/B006HIFZMW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Logitech Mk560 Wireless Wave Combo Plus: K351 Keyboard & M705 Wireless Mouse</a>&nbsp;is one of the ones that just doesn't work.  The connection to the devices seems to drop whenever they're idle for about two seconds.  So, typing and pointing with these is just impossible.  Without a keyboard and mouse, you're stuck with using the controller for text/pointing input.  And that's a pain.

- No Multiple Users:  The Shield just doesn't support multiple users.  If a second person wants to sign in to the device for a personalized experience, he's SOL.  Yes, a second person can sign in.  But, to do that, the previous person must be logged out.  And, not JUST logged out.  Their account must be REMOVED.  That means that when they want to sign back in, they can't just choose a remembered account.  They have to laboriously go through the whole log in procedure again.  And, they have to use the controller for text input because, as noted above, the keyboard and mouse don't work.  Plus, the Settings/Apps/Recommendations/NVIDIA Gaming ID all stay the same across the accounts.  The only thing that logging in seems to do is specify the Google account to use to buy things.

- External Storage Isn't All That Useful:  Unless a game has been written to support external offload, you won't be able to move your games to an external device you've added for storage (USB connected drive or Micro SD card).  Yes, you can store data files, music, and photos on an external drive.  But, games are going to take up a lot of space.  As such, the 16GB version I bought isn't all that useful.  I read one review where the reviewers downloaded four games and filled up their storage.  Theoretically, that should change with Android M.  But, right now, if you're a gamer, it's not a good situation.

- I'm Just Old:  This relates to that 10 foot, living room, controller-based interface.  It just makes my brain itch.  The interface design standards seem to be such that nothing tells anyone anything.  In general, if you've got a row of icons sitting on the screen, making them active and waiting doesn't get you any information.  I can't tell you how many times I've looked at those icons throughout the games and system and wondered what in the heck they do.  If I select it (using the never explained buttons on the controller), will it erase the game, format the drive, blow up the television, crash the car, and level the house?  Or, will it mark something as a favorite?  I don't know.  I'm of an age where I wonder about older people who can't understand that they can just click on the Start Button to do something.  Now, I've realized that my son is of an age where he's got to wonder about me when I can't understand what the buttons and icons on these controller-based interfaces do.  It's sad.

Anyway, I'm a bit upset with this NVIDIA Shield.  With it's tremendous hardware specs, it promised so much.  But, it just hasn't delivered yet.  So, I'm sorry to say that I'm rating it at a Not Very Good 2 stars out of 5.  I'll see if Amazon will let me return it.  Maybe I'll end up selling it.",Tremendous Promise -- Unfulfilled,1433462400,18,{'Edition:': ' New'},

With 3D computer animations so accessible, it's relatively simple to wrap a graphic interface around a basic storyline, as evidenced by the multitude of DreamCatcher Interactive games.

Case in point: Odyssey: The Search for Ulysses follows the adventures of Heritias (or is it Heriseus?) in his quest to find the missing Ulysses (or perhaps it's Odysseus. The story, inexplicably, switches back and forth between the use of Greek and Roman terminology for its characters, as evidenced by the mix of references in the game's title, an aspect guaranteed to annoy scholars.

Everyone else will simply be annoyed by the interface. Odyssey: The Search for Ulysses looks like a typical adventure game because Heritias has a sword that he wields, walks around in an ancient setting and meets mythical characters. But this is far from a typical hack-and-slash game and, in reality, is nothing more than a series of puzzles that our hero must figure out in order to advance in his quest to find Ulysses.

The quest itself has all the depth of the old text-based adventure games, to wit, the likelihood of Heritias completing his quest is exceptionally low unless fate intervenes - which it does by bashing him over the head and it's downhill from there. Heritias doesn't have a lot of choices although there are two different moral paths he can pursue - neither of which is particularly clear.

Because there's only one action function, hitting the space bar, many quests can simply be resolved by walking over every square inch of terrain and pressing the space bar repeatedly. On the surface, this would seem to make the game minimally playable but, unfortunately, it's especially unforgiving in its implementation of Heritias' choices. For example, at one point he must remove a basket from a hook with his hands tied behind his back. Now, it seems feasible that our hero would use his head to nudge the basket over or his teeth to tug it off the hook. But, no, there is only one acceptable solution and it's not the most logical: he must turn his back to the hook to remove the basket.

Although Heritias has a sword, combat is not strategic in nature, as some opponents will simply kill him outright, regardless of whether or not he's armed. In short, his sword is usually there for show only. Odyssey: The Search for Ulysses is a hard game but not because it's challenging. An awkward interface, combined with a limited plot, makes for an unfulfilling rote adventure.",Unfulfilling Rote Adventure,1235779200,2,,

If you're reading this review, chances are you've read about the lag that is present in this game when going through HDMI, which is why they recommend going straight from the console to your receiver.  If you haven't read about that, please google it before buying the game, so you know what you'll need to do in order to deal with it.

If you read even further, you'll find that for the PS3 and X360 version, they tell you to use analog output - not digital - to route the audio to the receiver in order to achieve the best possible result.  The problem is that, unlike the PS3 and X360, the PS4 and XBONE have no analog outputs, the best you can do is use an optical cable to go directly to your receiver (which is what they recommend), but there is still a noticeable amount of lag, which I personally find to be unacceptable.

One workaround that some people have been using is to get a splitter and send the guitar output to both the game and a guitar amplifier, then mute the player 1 guitar in the game.

Still, I believe they should not have ported this game to the current gen consoles since the inherent lag from the digital audio output seriously affects the ability to enjoy the game.

ANYWAY, to avoid 8 pages of whining, I'll skip ahead to where i got to the oblivion gate and had to rescue people hidden inside a tower. There were guards outside but they had no intention of helping me. Yes it was up to a thief (or agent actually) to rescue all these people who wouldnt even help themselves). A bunch of goblin-like creatures were outside who endlessly pelted me with fireballs and unerringly hit me even in midjump.

2.0,True,"03 19, 2015",A3O7H3M00SRC3E,B00KWJ4JW4,Gamereviewer84,"Originally reviewed by me at somnambulant-gamer.com:

Normally I'm the kind of person who, if I don't have anything positive to say about a game, just doesn't say anything. It's not really worth my time to write about a game I don't care about, right? But Final Fantasy Type-0 is terrible, and I really feel it's only fair to let you know. This game was actually so bad, I had to wait a day to write about it, because yesterday afternoon I actually wanted to title this post ""Type 0: a crappy game from crappy people who want you to waste your money on crappy things"". My grumpiness was compounded somewhat by the fact that all the big review sites like IGN and Gamespot were giving this game glowing reviews that it frankly didn't deserve, which led to me wasting money. Okay, enough venting, let me get into this.

The game starts out with a cinematic that was probably only 15 to 20 minutes long, but felt like 3 hours. It was atrocious, disjointed, and fully 3/4 of the cinematic is spent on the tragic death of a character I can only assume you're supposed to care about, because you have absolutely no idea who he is at this point. The graphics look to be polished versions of something you might expect to see on a hand-held device that's a generation or two out of date (because they are), which isn't too terrible, except in a few instances where you've got characters with highly detailed faces and wafting individual strands of hair who still have blocky shovel hands reminiscent of World of Warcraft characters prior to the Warlords of Draenor update. Apparently, the game is about 4 countries (that maybe have crystals?) that are represented by signature beasts: a white tiger, an azure dragon, a red phoenix, and a black tortoise. Fans of the franchise will recognize the references to (and overt appearances of) staples such as the Bahamut and Phoenix eidolons. The country with the tigers has magitek machines, and apparently they go to war against the country with the phoenix, which for reasons inadequately explained until many, many hours later leads them to attack the stronghold of the country with the azure dragon.

You're dropped into this war as three kids who just saw another kid (presumably one of their number based on the uniform and pretty much nothing else at this point) die after struggling to find them (with no other apparent purpose) and apparently being too wounded to be healed by magic despite the fact that it takes him fully ten freaking minutes of cinematics after the attempt to finally kick the bucket, at which point his chocobo (big two-legged riding bird, staple of the franchise), who's seemed dead for about eight of those ten minutes, gives a mournful cry in a blatantly manipulative attempt to evoke an emotion the game hasn't earned. Then you get to spend about an hour and some change running through the city being subjected to some of the most boring and uninspired combat and maps you've seen in the last decade. The combat itself is brutally disappointing, reminiscent of the repetitive slogs seen in games like Devil May Cry where you hack and slash your way through dozens of faceless mooks over and over, without the inspired combo systems and flashy design that made that game a success. There's lots of small issues interspersed through the combat system as well, including clunky targeting with a mind of its own, frequent (if fairly short) load times, and one of my personal pet peeves - camera angles that are a greater hindrance to your party's advancement than the actual enemies.

You get to control three (of an eventual fourteen) characters during this section, a character who uses magical cards to attack and perform other maneuvers (a cool and almost successful call-back to fan-favorites of the franchise like Setzer in Final Fantasy III / VI), one who uses a spear and a jump attack (the ""dragoon""), and a character who fights with a chinese longsword. Each character has all of four combat options available at this point, a standard attack, their special trick (card shuffling, jumping, and an AoE aura effect), one spell of a given element, and their defensive option. The combat has been compared to Crisis Core by several sites, but I really feel that does a disservice to Crisis Core, which had a robust combat interface that flowed seamlessly between the combat and exploration phases and utilized a highly customizable materia system that was actually pretty advanced for its time.

I feel like I have to find some redeeming quality in the game at this point... Okay, there's two things. The first, is that the cinematics, while climactically disjointed and painfully, brutally boring, go to places that are out of the norm for the franchise, in a good way. You'll see Square-Enix referring to this game as a ""more mature"" entry. While the actual story-line is about as mature as a twelve year writing his first piece of fan fiction, what this is really referencing is the fact that in this war-time environment, we actually see spurts of blood when someone is shot or stabbed, soldiers ruthlessly gunning down or bayoneting enemy wizards and civilians, etc. If some real character and story development had been married to a cohesive plotline and a modern combat interface, this could have been an amazing step for the Final Fantasy franchise, whose original fans are now at an age where they have kids, or even grandkids, of their own.

The second redeeming quality is that the game comes with a playable demo of Final Fantasy XV, an actual next-gen game set in the same world. Final Fantasy XV seems to be set to offer many of the things this game lacks: strong character development, a cohesive story, true next-gen graphics, and a robust combat system. While obviously still in the developmental stage, this fledgling game helped to restore some of the faith and hope that the actual game it was packaged with sucked out of me like some kind of vampiric leech that feeds on joy and nostalgia. Unfortunately, at the end of the day Type-0 isn't really a game; it's an advertisement for the actual game that they expect you to pay $60 for.","Unless you're okay with spending $60 dollars for the demo of an actual good game, this probably isn't worth your money",1426723200,13,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Story: 5/10

If you've played PS1 or PS2-launch titles, you're not far from what you'll see here. The scenery looks nice, but character models are unimaginative and relatively bland. While your appearance changes based on armor, it's not a drastic change and the benefits of new equipment aren't much different than ""a new coat of paint"". The camera is fixed at a slightly offset top-down that generally doesn't hide obstacles but also doesn't give you a satisfying way to navigate. The lack of differentiation between non-interactive terrain dressing and potentially useful objects like item boxes is also unhelpful. Not terrible, but the lack of distinction brought the score down.
Graphics: 5/10

Unexceptional sounds at best, some were annoying. Volume can't be controlled in-game, and the voicing ranged from ""bad rivaling cheap kung-fu dubs"" to ""modestly compelling"", with most of it being unimaginative and repetitive - particularly the shops, who won't shut up while you're trying to shop.
Sound: 4/10

Little actually stood out, but after having been through soundtracks like .Hack//G.U. or Ace Combat 5, I expect music that won't be missed in an empty elevator.
Music: 5/10

A very basic ""dungeon crawler"", I feel that calling it a hack-and-slash does a disservice to action games like Gauntlet or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dynasty-Warriors-Strikeforce/dp/B001L8DKL6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dynasty Warriors: Strikeforce</a>&nbsp;that do that subgenre justice. Enemies are difficult - you may like or dislike this - but they don't respawn, so if you want to practice or level grind, you have to save character data and start a new game, then import. Random drops and inconsistent ability - enemies tended to hit every swing even if they weren't at optimal range, whereas everything from bows to great swords to daggers had a tendency to miss - not dodged, but simply doing nothing. The fact that everything has a single swing as its whole moveset was especially disappointing, at least Gauntlet had reverse-strokes instead of the same chop time after time.
Gameplay: 4/10

You can import character data into any game load that you please, but as awkward as the game felt to play through in the first place and as miniscule as the benefits of revisiting an area are (especially with the steps you have to take), I just can't in good conscience recommend this when there are so many other games that actually let you have fun throughout, and then games like Ratchet & Clank let you cruise back through the story with all the goodies you earned.
Replayability: 2/10

But man, this is just boring.

There are no tactics or skills required to play this game whatsoever, you just mash buttons at hordes of enemies, level up and get better gear. As a single player game, it gets incredibly boring fast. Playing with others makes it a little more fun, but not much. There's so many better options these days, I really just don't get it.

Honestly the only reason people get hooked on this game, is the same reason people get hooked on web games like Farmville. There's just this compulsion to keep playing to acquire more and more virtual items. That's how Blizzard defines difficulty as well. In most RPGs, higher difficulty means enemies are harder to kill, you're easier to kill, and everything else remains the same. Meaning you have to adjust your tactics, prepare for big battles ahead of time, and plan your character progression more carefully with a focus on min/maxing. In this game, the multiple difficulty settings are just a way to compensate for the increased power you get with gear.

D2 practically created the RPG concept of ""endgame"". Where you hit max level, and then just grind for gear. WoW incorporated this idea as well with their raiding system. I just don't get the appeal of it, why would you want to rush through so much content to just do the same thing over and over to obtain a few virtual items? Well, there are millions who like this sort of thing, so maybe I'm the weird one.

Anyways, aside from it's rather uninspired gameplay, the graphics are dated, definitely not PS4 worthy, the story is absurd, and it's just plain boring to play.

If you want mindless hack n slash, there are so many other options out there, some free, some with much better eye candy. If you want a tactical RPG, this ain't it. If you want an engrossing story, sorry, keep moving along. If the idea of spending endless hours doing the same thing over and over to slowly accumulate virtual items is appealing to you, then Diablo 3 is the game for you.",Snoozefest,1409011200,15,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
2.0,False,"01 17, 2005",A1SIAC1Q9Z3KK4,B00029QR8I,R.J.Roberts,"I did just about everything there was to do in this game after about 2 hours of playing it.  While it's boasted to be a free-ranged adventure, i often think that the game basically boils down to doing 6 things; sailing, ship battles, land battles, walking, dancing, and sword fights.  Each of which is a pretty lackluster experience as well.  The entire game has a ""cheap"" feel to it, as if the designers just gave up on every area before it was finished.

The dancing and the sword fight scenes are mildly interesting at first, but they become mind bogglingly boring and  quickly.  Repetitious. What's even more frustrating is that these are one of the main features of the game, and they get old after you do each three or four times.  If these were just minor mini-games in a broad range of interactive gaming, then they could get away with it; as it is they feel like the semester project for a college game programer, extremely simple and lacking anything resembling depth.

The most entertaining part of the game is the ship to ship battles, even though they are fairly pointless.  It's actually much more convienent most of the time to just ram your opponent and initiate a swordfight, as your ship takes a minimal amount of damage, and swordfights are fairly easy once you get the hang of them.  If you win the swordfight then the enemy's ship is won as well.

The game boasts 20 or so ships, however a good many of them are completely worthless.  In fact, the game basically only gives you three ships that you would actually want to use, 10 or so of them are merchant ships and have no use at all in battle, they're only useful as having in your fleet to carry cargo.  For your flagship you're basically limited to:

Royal Sloop

Fast, manuverable, moderate firepower

Brig of War

Moderate speed, manuverable, heavy firepower

Large Frigate (or Ship of the Line if you're extremely lucky to find one)

Fast, not very manuverable, intense firepower

Every other ship the game offers is just a downgraded version of the previous three with less crew capacity, or a ship that has such a blaring weakness that it makes it useless.  The only reason you'd use any other ship than those three is if you just started the game out, or you lost your ship in battle. It's also worth mentioning that the three main ships are all basically the same ship, just different advantages and disadvantages.  You can destroy a royal galleon with either of the three fairly easy, it just depends on your preference in style.

The game gives you the option to act as a trader, buying low and selling high at different points, but this as well is fairly pointless as there's much more money to be made by just attacking other ships, as you don't have to worry about cargo space, and added crew for additional merchant ships to carry all the goods. Plus it's much more fun to attack ships, and most single ships will net as much cash as any good trade run will.

All in all, i find it's an almost embarrasingly sparse game.  I can not believe that i actually paid $49.99 for it, this really does seem like it should be on the $10 new titles shelf with all those other cheaply made games.

 Most noticebly is the controls. The controls in this game are aweful! You have no idea how many cheep deaths the controls caused me. Its the main reason why I could never get pass the first boss. This is an extreme problem when you're facing more than one enemy because the controls won't respond when you need them to. The camera doesn't make things any easier. When platforming the jumping controls and camera will often cause cheep deaths because you can't see where your going or jump at an angle that causes you to fall off.

 Another issue I had is that when you get a game over you start all the way to the beginning of the game. Extra lives are also hard to find. This wouldn't be so bad if the controls weren't so bad.

 The plus side though is that the music is wonderful and there are moments that are creepy AND SCARY. I would love it if they remade this for the Wii, Xbox, or PS3 with better controls and handling, but due to how long its been I don't see that happening.",Snap Judgement Review...,1280016000,,,
2.0,False,"06 3, 2012",A1C7BWPATO40VA,B00178630A,Nathan T.,"I know it's still new, I really hope the patches and expansion make this game a lot better. At the moment this is how I feel:

I'm a witch doctor that does 35k damage with stacks, 44k health, 700-800all resist, took out inferno butcher in 7 seconds.

I know this game is suppose to have numerous patches to even up the odds and make things more reasonable, but it is so absurdly unbalance it almost feels like they didn't even really test it out. Honestly, when I heard Jay Wilson say he let the best players at blizzard try the game out and double the difficulty, I thought that was a really [not so smart] comment. We waited how long and they still couldn't at least test it out better?

1. Monsters: Blizzard's attempt in being creative has made this game a joke, a very bad, unbalanced joke. Vortex and mortar has made it so that if you're a range champion that can't get close cause you'll get slaughtered, now if you're far you'll get slaughtered too. They've developed ridiculous OP abilities for these monsters. Laser, vortex, ice bomb, mortar, teleport, waller, invincibility, shield, etc (not getting technical with the actual names).

2. Easy mode is too easy and inferno mode is too hard. Easy mode bores me to death while inferno mode I can't find a random team that can even survive act 2....WE UNDERSTAND THAT INFERNO NEEDS TO BE CHALLENGING! But this is not fun kind of challenging. It's just mindless death due to the game being absurdly, ridiculously, hilariously unbalanced. This is the consensus of many many players that I've played with in random games. Running for your life all day gets old. They said you're suppose to farm hell difficulty in order to get geared for inferno, I saw what hell mobs drop, you have to farm months before you get anything worthwhile, again to the auction house. Gameplay for melee characters are especially rough.

3. Items are too randomized. Remember back in Diablo 2 where when you want an item like an SOJ, you just go ask for one? Now you have to deal with 1000++ different kinds of sojs. This also sucks for magic finding (which leads me to number 4 btw) because there's so much randomness that finding a good item is even harder because of having so many variables.

4. Again I know they will patch it ONE DAY, but atm, in order to do inferno act 1 and especially 2, you need items from inferno act 4, which makes no sense. You need to kill elites in order to get the items that you really need to kill THOSE elites..... Even so, I've done countless MF runs and pretty much 99% of the items I find, I can't really use. 190 DPS sword in inferno? Really?!? The game obviously has set it so that you're forced to visit the auction house to even try to stay relevant, which just puts money into blizzard's pockets and I think that whole marketing concept is just low. Which leads me to number 5.

5. So only way to stay relevant is to stay in the auction house all day long in hopes of finding an item for a reasonable price cause there's ridiculous pricing going around like 90 mil for a ring or a good item. Even when you get the item you worked so long to get, sometimes it barely changes the game cause mobs in inferno is so hard that they take you out anyhow. Saving your tushie off has now helped you to survive a mob for 0.3 seconds longer!

6. Because you can't survive even though you have so much health and resist, which was recommended to you for survivability, you now have to revert to building a glass cannon build and kite your **** off all day in order to get horrible items. So the game consists of running for your life, stop, shoot, die, revive, run for your life some more and repeat. For melee characters that were suppose to be able to take hits, they now find themselves unable to do so even when they have tons of life and resist and the only option is to hit and run as well. Act 2 inferno is beyond belief.

The advancement from Diablo 1 to Diablo 2 were easily seen and done, but from Diablo 2's amazingly deep and addictive gameplay, Diablo 3 just couldn't advance far enough to live up to the name.

Diablo 3 lacks many other things as well such as randomized levels. Now the levels are not as randomized. Like if an entrance is usually at the top of the map, if you start a new game, the level will look slightly different but the entrance will still be around the general area or areas.",Avid Player from Diablo 1 then Diablo 2 and Now Diablo 3,1338681600,18,{'Format:': ' Computer Game'},

I ordered this directly from the Gamesir Direct Store. After seeing this review, they offered a troubleshooting tip, which didn't help. They also offered to send me the newer G4s to see if the newer product works for me. I'll update this review if they do send one, as this would reflect well on the company. If the newer model does work, I'll include that info as well to allow other Windows 10 users to better chose which model to order.

The controller did appear to work fine on my Nexus 6P, with Android 7.1.1, though I didn't do more than a brief test and didn't try the smart phone bracket, it at last paired up fine and controls registered in the game I tested.

I wish I had a PC with a pre- Windows 10 OS to test, but I don't, so I can only say it didn't work for any of my games on Windows 10.

Do not buy for Windows 10 PC!

This controller was recognized by windows as a generic HID controller and you can see the controls do register in the device settings. However, in order to work with games compatible with an XBox Controller, you need to install the XBox 360 Controller Driver, as Gamesir states. Propblem is that Windows 10 does not recognize this controller as XBox Controller compatible and will not install the XBox Controller driver. There is no way to manually install the Windows 10 driver and trying to install the Windows 7 driver does nothing.

The only thing this controller will actually control on my Win 10 PC and Laptop is the Steam Big Picture menus. Oh, and the Home button opens the Microsoft Web-browser on desktop. (Gee, thanks...) No game I've tested can actually recognize input from this controller, which makes this game controller pointless for Windows 10 games!

There is no Gamesir driver download, nor is there any software to tune the controller or, possibly, allow Windows 10 games to actually recognize this thing.

I bought this because I rarely game on my Nexus 6P and liked the cross compatibility and the smart phone clamp, but as I need this mostly for PC gaming, it's worthless to me.

Aside from this issue, the controller is light and feels a bit cheap. The rechargeable battery is built in and can not be replaced, so when it stops holding a good charge, you either have to toss it or use it in wired mode.

Speaking or which, the Windows 10 issue is not limited to wireless. I tried it in wired mode as well and no better luck getting it to work with any games.

Don't advertise a controller as Windows Plug and Play if that isn't actually the case! Maybe it works on older windows or ancient games, but this is a dud for anyone with a Windows 10 PC looking to play any recent games.",Do not buy for Windows 10 PC,1485043200,,{'Color:': ' G3s'},

You can get people to like you or hate you.  But in the end, what's the point?  The people have no bearing on the rest of the game.  It's just a gimmick that's slapped on.

Need for Speed: Undercover is an arcade-style racing game that takes place in the fictious tri-city.  Bascially, the entire map is of three different cities linked by a massive highway system.  The story involves you, the driver, being undercover in order to dismantle an illegal crime syndicate.  And that's where the fun ends.  Yes, before it even starts.

For one, the game just looks awful.  As I ran the game on high, the street constantly looks like it rained five minutes before the race even began.  This, along with many many aspects of the game, gets old very quickly.  Another thing I don't like is the glaring sun.  The game looks as if it takes place at either an hour or so after sunrise, or sunset.  Never midday, a time point where you don't have to worry about the sun making it almost impossible to not only see where you're going right in front of you, but to also see where you're going on the mini-map.  Because of it's light-blue shade, anytime the sun in the game is anywhere near your screen, you're not going to be able to see it.

The acting is another abysmal part of the game.  It's disappointing that the only thing I actually look forward to in cutscenes is to see how attractive Maggie Q looks, because I can always see that for free on the internet.  Here you'll find your typical, ""I'm trying to hard to be a cool bad guy, so I'm a colossal fail at it"" type of characters.  Your caucasian girl saying ""Dog"" because her boyfriend, who just so happens to be black (oh the irony) also thinks he's a tough guy by screaming into the phone about how he's going to get revenge for beating him last time.  And, of course, you have your ""Oh you think you're tough?  Well I'm tougher.  Just look at how my face gets twisted up!"" characters.  Seriously, EA?  I could've done a better job.....FOR FREE!

But the main thing(s) that kill this game is.....well, the game itself.  The controls have latency issues.  It takes half a second for the car to respond to me turning left or right, but NoS and acceleration, along with breaking, are just fine?  Along with bad controls, the AI is just plain braindead.  And I don't mean braindead as in the game is too easy.  I mean braindead as in they don't have any common sense....PERIOD!  Cut in front of a driver and he'll t-bone you right into the wall.  You don't even have to cut them off.  You could be well ahead, and they'll catch you, spin you out, and another one will ram you even harder.  Just happen to be a few inches away from another driver will cause them to ram you for no reason, no matter how wide the road actually is.  I once started a race and the Porsche in front of me was going in REVERSE........I kid you not.  The car was going in reverse.  Traffic, for some reason, LOVES to turn in front of you, or spawn out of nowhere.  If you're in one lane, traffic will sometimes try to cut you off, even though they're going 60mph and you're going 200mph.  I've also seen traffic literally turn around, travel the wrong way, and hit you.  And the cops?  pfft, laughable.  Doing the missons where you have to steal a car becomes so annoying 80% of the time.  Cop cars will literally, and I mean LITERALLY, spawn right behind you, out of nowhere.  You could be racing, the driver's 10 seconds behind you, your radar isn't going off, they haven't even mentioned the cops being alert to street-racing, and POOOF! there's a cop car behind you.  I've seen cop cars spawn behind me when I've almost evaded them, and they have also spawned in front of me as well.

And one more gripe.  The game becomes too difficult too quickly.  One point, you're destroying everything in a 240sx, and the next, you're sitting in a Tier 3 car and Tier 1's (the highest tier) line up next to you.  So someone, please tell me.  How is a stock Skyline GT-R R34 supposed to beat a tuned Lamborghini Murcielago?  I'll give you a hint: It can't.  They're not even in the same class in real life.  Why make me race cars two tiers ahead of mine?

Need for Speed: Undercover is the exact opposite of Most Wanted, which is based on a similar, epic street-racing, illicit acts, avoid the cops type of style.  Most Wanted had characters that, granted had their cheesy moments, still were at the very least decent and fit the story line very well.  The cops were smart and didn't say ""uhm, they're driving a blue sports car....I think"", they had more dialogue, more believable dialogue, more intellectual dialogue, and the game was a complete blast all around.  It still is six years later.  Undercover, however......honestly, let's not even talk about it anymore.  Yup, it's that bad.

Look, Fallout 4 isn't a bad game by any means. But, it is a game riddled with dumb annoyances and issues that make it far from being the game we had hoped for. I wanted to wait a while to write a review, so I could be more objective about the game.

First and foremost, Fallout is no longer an RPG, it's an FPS masquerading as an RPG with all the familiar visual Fallout elements from the last couple of games. In many, many ways Fallout 4 is a step down from Fallout 3, and a HUGE step down from New Vegas.

Everything has been given the casualization treatment, right down to the dialogue. Everything feels barebones. The choice aspect of the previous games has been all but washed away. Of course Id rather experience the game without the terrible dialogue wheel, but guess what? If you mod the game, you're punished for it.

In fact, thats one of my biggest reasons for the thumbs down: the loss of the ability to earn achievements if you use any mods. Activate any one mod and say bye bye to your ability to continue earning achievements. There's no good reason for this and it's a con. Straight up. A Bethesda title of all things, a developer that encourages the use of mods, punishes you for their use. Unbelievable.

Optimization is another issue. This is common with Bethesda games, but the framerate in Downtown Boston is horrendous. It's been what? 8 months since release and this is still an issue. It'll never be officially fixed I'm sure. I have a GTX 960, I get pretty much a solid 60 fps just about everywhere outside of Downtown... wander through there and I can drop to as low as 24 fps. Thats inexcusable.

The Season Pass is another letdown, I haven't purchased it yet, but there is very little incentive to do so now. The last DLC is already coming next month, right after we were promised way more DLC than originally planned and a $20 price hike. To add insult to injury, a good amount of the ideas present within the content that is coming out via the Season Pass was already possible through player made mods for months. Some first class ideas for sure It just works.

Id be lying if I said I have not enjoyed my time with the game thus far. I certainly have, and I will continue to play it. But the cons objectively outweigh the pros. I hate to see what Todds team will do to further desecrate the series in future titles. It seems like every release from Bethesda is more barebones than the last, focused on the mainstream casual gamer, rather than the core audience that has been playing Bethesda titles since the beginning.

I will continue to update this as I play more, but at this point, several hours into playing the multiplayer, I just can't recommend this game.  I love love love Battlefield 3, my first exposure to the franchise, but this game just sort of limps along, like it's older brother's reputation alone will ensure its success.  So far, it's failing.  It feel svery incomplete, the graphics are surprisingly poor and fuzzy, the levels small and unfinished (and unfurnished), and the damage models just atrocious. There are pros, but there are cons, and I'll try to list them out quickly and concisely and then apply more detail later on. I thought it looked bad in the Beta, but assumed they would clean it up for the actual game.  I was wrong.

Pros:
1) Sound.  It's excellent.  The weapons, the footsteps, the scream of the A10 as it pulls away from a strafing run are all deep, tangible, and real sounding.  They did a great job with this aspect.
2) The COAX machine gun on tanks and APCs looks pretty close to the way it does in real life when the tracers go away.  It's pretty cool.

Cons:
1) Maps: BF3 was known for big, beautiful maps that gave all sorts of freedom of movement and plenty of room for air power to figure itself out.  The maps played so far (I'm playing a lot of conquest, known for big full vehicle maps) are all cramped, and if you're flying an attack jet, be prepared to turn it around real quick or risk getting timed out out of bounds.  Frustrating.  The ""Levolution"" isn't all that great either, and we played some level where the water kept rising, and it just got kind of stupid with the LAVs floating around lobbing rounds at each other and all the players essentially holing up in whatever building they started in because to try to swim to the next was sure to be met with a hail of gunfire.  You could level buildings in BF3 just fine, we don't need to cut the grass here...
2) Soldier equipment layouts: There is no real incentive to advance your weapon of choice as you start with some pretty good kit.  That motivation to evolve drove a lot of playing and varied playing style in BF3, and it's everybody running the same load out so far and I imagine will be like that as players evolve.  This will make it much harder for new players to join when vets discover the magical weapon combo that is surely out there.
3) Weapons:  I don't know what the designers were thinking when they made the rocket that all engineers start out with, but it's horrible for game play and I'm unsure of how or why it was necessary.  It's part SMAW/RPG and part Javelin, so basically if you throw a rocket anywhere near a vehicle, it will ""lock on"" adjust in flight, and execute a top down attack.  This is cool and all, but removes the fun of dumb-flight rockets and the skill needed on the anti-tank soldiers part and on the player who is being targeted in the vehicle.  Several weapons are seriously overpowered, and then there's the vehicles....
4) Vehicles: Apparently, a main battle tank can't travel faster than about 10 miles an hour.  This is against all my understanding and experience gained as a Tank Platoon Leader in the Army.  The good thing is that the vehicles can actually take some damage and survive. This is of course, vital, as everybody now has magic rockets that they can throw in your general direction and achieve hits.  The bad thing is that it takes over 5 rockets to kill an APC, which is really stupid.  I've actually run out of ammunition firing on an APC, registering hits the entire time, and had to reteat while the vehicle sat there oblivious and shooting away in the other direction.

This has been a terrible experience, and the only reason I'll keep it on hand is to level up for when it does show up for the XBOX ONE.  I just hope about 300 patches and fixes also show up with it.  I'll never pre-order a game like this again after this experience, and I do mean it.  This has been a big disappointment.","Nothing new, and everything you remember and love from BF3 is worse.

Even before the Playstation Mortal Kombat was known as a groundbreaking game for its graphic violence on the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis. It was the first of its kind, or one of the first. Looking back at the old 2D fighter games, despite the heavy amount of blood and all the creative fatalities, Mortal Kombat STINKS, plain and simple. The game tries to look dangerous and back in the day it really WAS a threat. Parents were terrified that their children might experience all the blood and gore.

We're talking nearly 14 years since the original Mortal Kombats release, and now we can look at the Mortal Kombat series for what it really is: a cheesy-looking and crappy series of uninteresting tournament fighting. That's what the entire series is (until the game turned 3D, then I don't know WHAT to think). Just the way the two fighters attack each other is SO boring. Even the best fighters like Sub-Zero and Noob Saibot are a total bore.

Midway thought they really had something going when they created Mortal Kombat Trilogy. It featured nearly EVERYBODY from the previous Mortal Kombat games. How can it be bad? Well, besides the reasons I mention above, the Playstation version is murdered with INCREDIBLE amounts of loading times. People can say the Playstation was a bad system when it came to loading all they want, but the fact remains Mortal Kombat Trilogy is quite possibly the most annoying game when it comes to waiting to play the freaking thing. Sometimes you have to wait almost a minute before the game *finally* loads the fight screen. And the fighting is so bad (because the entire Mortal Kombat series up until this point is severely dated and horrible) that the loading times are actually the part I look forward to the most.

Who on earth would wrap a game up with a combination of shoulder button, a, b, d-pad up?  It makes no sense, whereas the prequel had an epic battle, this game ended with a feeling that the designers were bored of the game.
Going against the gritty look of the first game with everything being so damn shiny, Merc 2 took away what worked best in what seemed an honest attempt at making an inferior game.  Gone were the sensible systems of purchases (You have to run around to different people to buy what you need, we do have phones and the internet, heck the people you buy from give you business cards that often have phone numbers, which when you need to go to a loading screen to buy things and get missions... it detracts).  Who cares that most of your support strikes are called in by means that leaves you at ground zero, you will find most of them are useless as they have a penchant of blowing you up in the process.
Most annoyingly, the vast majority of the game can and should be beaten in a helicopter.  No need for about 90% of the vehicles, they lack the mobility or firepower that the higher end attack choppers are loaded with.  Which brings me to the grapple system and the vehicle boarding system, it is frustrating.  I know they want to make it more of a challenge so you can't just hijack everything with ease, but honestly it is annoying as they didn't even vary the sequences to make things at least a challenge.  Just memorize the pattern for each vehicle and close your eyes.  Then the vehicles you have more than likely will disappear when you go to buy stuff or take a mission, you can't even put things into this garage that you supposedly have.
The game redeems itself in a decent storyline and fantastic graphics, but those alone can't make up for a broken game play system.  So much of the game was rinse, wash, and forget where you put the detergent, then repeat.  I'd rather play the first game, it was at least consistently fun.

Pros:

-Graphics are awesome. Very, very sweet.

-Customize your lightsaber-add different abilities and change the color; great concept!

-Force powers: really well done. Don't expect to beat this game just swinging your lightsaber. If you don't learn to use the force, you will not get far AND you will be miserable. Using Force grip, charging the target with lightning and throwing it at groups of enemies was amongst the most enjoyable video game experiences ever for me.

Cons:

- Too quick. I beat the game in 8 hours of gameplay and I was taking my time!
-Very glitchy. I got caught in glitches about 6 times and had to reset. Very annoying, especially during boss fights.
- >>SPOILER ALERT<<Targeting sucks. ESPECIALLY on large objects. Wait till you need to use the force to grab Tie fighters in the second to last level; you will know what misery really is.
-Lack of imagination on the names. Starkiller? Juno Eclipse? Mammoth Super Star Destroyer? Are you kidding me?
- >>SPOILER ALERT<< The ending. Easily the most anti-climactic ending I've seen in a long time. Are we supposed to believe that this guy, who is capable of pulling an entire Star Destroyer down with Force Grip AND can beat the crap out of Vader and the Emperor in back-to-back battles is just gonna die the way he did?

I almost gave up and ordered one off eBay from China, until one popped up at a good price. Looking back, I may have been better off ordering the knock-off from China as it seemed to have better contours.

This one's made by Cyber Gadget, and their other grips are wonderful. At least their later ones. I own one for my 3DS XL and it's my favorite grip out of them all; it's almost as good as the most comfortable controller. The PSP and 3DS XL grips are made from the same rubber-like material.

What makes a good grip for me is having a fat eggplant shape so your palms can extend out the back of the handheld, and legs/arms/handles that stretch downward, this way your hands feel like they're holding a controller rather than having them scrunched closely to the sides of the handheld, like you weren't holding a grip at all.

This grip has excellent construction, no doubt, like any other Cyber Gadget grip, but it's missing one crucial feature mentioned above: the eggplant shape. This means that, while there are arms hanging downward, my hands come into a rather awkward and unpleasant position. I've had to train myself to hold the grip as if I were holding the PSP by itself, with my palms resting on the arms, except now I've got nothing for my fingertips to hang on to. So they curl back in toward the PSP. That would be the end of it, except the right handle, as you can see in the picture, has a cut out to make way for the power slide, but it didn't need that much chunk taken out. So what that means is that my right hand is a lot more uncomfortable than my left.

It sounds weird describing it, but that's how it is. It's still better than using the PSP by itself, and the mechanism for tightening and loosening the PSP is fantastic (there's a little knob on the bottom that unscrews to let you slide down the bottom and insert the PSP), and the back opens and snaps just fine to remove and insert UMDs. It's just not as comfortable as other grips.

I dreaded what I thought might happen in Awakenings, but I bought it anyhow. Like other reviewers have said, Awakenings was a corporate strategy to bring in quick revenue.

Here are some details.

One of the things that kept me addicted to DA-O, was that I cared about many of the party members. Many of them were genuinely likeable characters. In DA-A, the only character I cared about was killed in the first hour of game play. I don't think there is anything on earth I could care less about than the welfare of the party members in DA-A. You have a zombie, a murdering maleficar, a murdering elf mage, the drunken sot/perv from the DA-O, and so on. Give me someone to care about!

The voice acting got an A+ from me on DA-O. Sorry, but the voice acting gets a C from me in DA-A. Very average.

The official strategy guide says you get to keep all your cool gear from DA-O.  Actually, I have not been able to keep the Helm of Honnleath nor the Starfang sword (one-handed or two-handed). It didn't matter whether this gear was equipped or just in inventory, it didn't arrive with my characters in DA-A. I tried several times with many combinations.  Just FYI. If the Starfang sword is the *only* sword your main toon has in DA-O, your character will import into DA-A into a battle situation with no weapon.

The ending in DA-O was incredibly satisfying, and did an excellent job at bringing closure to the game. You got to walk around and talk with your party members, seeing them off on their new adventures. By comparison, the door is slammed shut at the end of the DA-A. Of course, it doesn't really matter that you can't say goodbye to your party members, because you don't care about them anyway.

DA-A would have been worth the (...) if *all* of the same characters could have been brought forward from DA-O.

One note about the OSG. So far I have found two errors in the official strategy guide (both of them was with regard to what mob dropped what piece of special gear).  I looked in the guide when I can't find the final piece of matching gear, only to find that such-and-such a mob was supposed to have dropped it. I go back to the place where the battle took place, and sure enough, there is no such gear to be had.

The good news about DA-A is that it will break me of my addiction of playing Dragon Age.

Huge kudos to Bioware for Dragon Age: Origins. It is possibly the best RPG I have ever played. Huge jeers for Dragon Age: Awakenings.

2.0,False,"11 24, 2009",A1DW4DLMGIDNL1,B002EWD040,D. A. Lewis,"I've been waiting for this program for months. I've become a Wii exercise junkie. Just about everyday I work out with ""My Fitness Coach"", ""Wii Fit Plus"", and ""More EA active"" (I did workout with the originals but I recently upgraded). So when I found out that there was going to be a fitness program that utilized a camera to measure your proficiency, well I was thinking Flying cars just might not be that far behind. I knew it was going to be good - I mean after all, everyone learned a lesson from ""Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2009"" . . . Right . . .

Well, I got the program on release date and worked with it for about 2 hours (Set up and working out). The set up is easy. I was afraid the camera was going to utilize the motion sensor plug spot on my Wii. But no, the camera connects to the USB slot, so there's no need to be switching cables every-time I work with Your Shape. The profile set up is easy enough and of course you have to take a fitness test that gets graded. For some reason the program said I was doing my jumping jacks incorrectly, so my final fitness test grade was a B.

After the test you go into creating your workout schedule. Be careful here because I thought I was just checking out what they call ""Extra Challenges"", but instead ended up starting (and doing) a 30 minute yoga workout.

Now the trouble really starts.
Apparently the Your Shape people thought the annoying feedback chatter in EA Active is charming because I was getting a continuous string of peppy encouragement. At one time, during the corpse poss in yoga, there was nonsensical chatter like ""You can do it"", or ""feel them muscles stretch""or ""do you feel the burn"". I searched the menus for ways to turn off chatter but the best I could do is lower the voice. The yoga section was still pretty good, although in 30 minutes we only used about 8 moves. And BTW, they continued the same mistake in ""My Fitness coach"" where the trainer has you going through a seriers of yoga moves, about 4 times in a row, but unfortunately she only verbalizes the moves the first time. And then there were the workouts. If you have ""My Fitness coach"", then you already have this game. The only difference is ""Your Shape"" uses the camera. I spent a good deal of time requesting that my workouts center on my core and when my first ""Your Shape"" work out started it was just about the same workout I did this morning with My Fitness Coach (as a side not ""My Fitness coach"" used to be called ""Your Self Fitness""). And BTW, there were no real core exercises in my so called focused workout.

Today, I worked out with the program for about 90 minutes. And as I suspected, they took away the workout options that you have with ""My Fitness Coach"". In ""MFC"" you can pick the workout but here it is scheduled. As I stated earlier you can change the focus of the workout-but selecting an AB focus didn't seem to have any effect. Another thing they took away was the ability to pick the type of music you want to hear. The music is okay for Your Shape but I thought MFC did a superior job with the music selection plus you can pick the style you like. Still, I had no real problem with the music with Your Shape.

As far as the camera. The so called center piece of this game, well I was disppointed. As I stated earlier the game did no recognize my arm movements in the Fitness test. It turns out that was a fairly common occurance with some of the other exercises. Additionally there is a slight time lag between when you do the movements and when they appear on screen. And please wear light colored clothing, otherwise you won't really register on the TV screen. I really did not expect stellar video quality on a 70 dollar game. But it is serviceable as far as the game but the movement recognition has me concerned.

If you have ""My Fitness Coach"" or ""Your self Fitness"", don't bother getting ""Your Shape"". If you don't have one of those programs, wait until ""Your Shape"" comes down in price. Your Shape by itself is okay but considering it is really a watered down version of its two prior versions, it is hard to recommend the game.

Two stars because it will work you out, and the camera is a neat idea, but the other versions out there are better.

Despite a cult following, the mech customization video game has lost its touch time and time again. With the PSP version, Armored Core: Formula Front, this trend continues. Formula Front isn't as bad as the recent Ps2 outing, Nine Breaker, but arguably so. I wouldn't consider this an action game as much as I'd consider it a big game of chess, where the pawns and bishops are replaced with guns and different body parts of each robot.

In Armored Core: Formula Front, you are the engineer and leader of a team in the mech league known as the FFA. You customize and alter five of your very own mechs, each of which you try to differentiate in order to formulate strategic gameplans and strategies. Through winning matches, you progress through the FFA ranks and eventually become the top AC team. Throughout the experience, you'll be informed of all the latest FFA and team rules, you'll be challenged by beaten opponents, and more. This stuff kept me into the experience more than I expected.

Customizing your mechs is the name of the game here, and you could spend hours on each of your hulking robots. Each of the dozens and dozens of parts have different parameters that alter the performance of your AC. You can equip your mech with the strongest weaponry around, but those big guns will bog you down and overheat your mech faster than you'd ever believe. Of course, smaller guns make way for better agility and terrain movement as well as decreased energy use and better cooling. Equipping parts isn't the only thing you'll do. In fact, you'll tune those parts, replace them, set the AC's personal artificial intelligence, and more. It's all about your personal preferences, and of course the competition ahead. If you're about to go up against a defensively weak but speedy AC, you will want to plan accordingly and try to counter the AC with a speedy but powerful mech. If you're about to face a beefy pile of steel, you'll want to slow down the pace and have enough power to outlast your opponent, perhaps from long range. If you're into this kind of customization, you're going to absolutely love Formula Front. It's like a slower, virtual game of chess that involves robots and guns. If you don't, to put it bluntly, you're going to hate this game.

In the Japanese version of this game, you couldn't actually PLAY as your mechs--you could make them, coordinate their AI, and watch them fight. In the American version, you can actually control your ACs on the battlefield but the controls are so broken and the computer AI is so good that playing the game is a worthless effort. I eventually gave up and decided to watch the mechs fight instead. Fortunately the graphics are very attractive, and the mech action is fast-paced and exciting to watch. After playing a few matches I decided to stick to watching my mechs after tuning the AI, and I had a much better time. I'm very upset, though, that it's not as fun to play Formula Front.

As I said, the visuals are top-notch. This is a very attractive PSP game. You'll scope out individual parts and intricate details on your mechs. Explosion effects and particles look fantastic. Overall Formula Front looks like a second- or third-year Playstation 2 game. The music isn't bad, either--and when paired with the explosive sound effects, realistic warning sounds, and gunfire, this title is a nicely-presented game. Of course, it doesn't have an excuse to be anything otherwise. If a game's actual gameplay is indended to be observed rather than played, the game in mind should look and sound fantastic. This is Forumla Front's saving grace, and if you're one of the people I said would love the game earlier, these factors will only improve the experience to you.

I regret to report the rest of the PSP crowd that Armored Core: Formula Front isn't the action game you're looking for. Armored Core fans might enjoy it for its customization and impressive superficial qualities, but almost anyone else will immediately regret a purchase because there isn't much gameplay involved. From Software, I know you're capable of making an Armored Core that is more fun to play than watch. Please do it next time.

I couldn't find a way to quit out of this, so I assumed it was a tutorial.  It was not, the only instructions where the brief layout of the controller that was shown while the game loaded.  Finally after a quarter I quit and got to a main menu.

The menu interface is also presented with no instructions/tool tips and are not intuitive.  I went to practice, and practice again was incredibly frustrating.  I thought you'd be setting up plays or have some list abilities and how/when to use them, but nope, it's one player and the goalie, that it.  After 20 min practicing and realizing I hated the control set-up, I decided to try another game.

That brought about my complaints with the AI.  Seriously what is wrong with your teammates?  The computer controlled teammates have zero  awareness of the puck, I can't tell you how many times I saw the puck sitting right next to them, if you don't take control of the player, they will ignore it.  Then there is passing, ugh, passing.  So first of all the control (who you pass) to is awful.  About 60% of your passes in the general direction of one of your players, the other 40% is anybodies guess.  Also when you make a pass, the control swaps immediately to the intended target of the pass, if you are not moving in the same direction, you will frequently find yourself skating away from the puck, or in the wrong direction of the pass.  So let's say you manage to finally get a pass to the right person, sometimes it just randomly bounces off the player.

Finally in trying to tinker with the controls, I found a mode called Hockey 94.  I'm old enough to have played Hockey 94 for the Genesis, so I immediately swapped to that system.  It's a much more simplified system, but with all the other issues, it at least made the game playable for me.  I gave it 2 stars, cause the nostalgia of setting up one-timers in Hockey 94 was cool but I think if the only way you can enjoy a game on the ""next generation"" system is to revert the controls back to a 20 year old model, something has gone terribly wrong.",Very Dissapointing,1410307200,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The entire game is centered around playing with your friends.  It was how it was marketed and its where the game truly shines.  The original Left 4 Dead's matchmaking and spot on dedicated servers made its play consistant and highly addictive.  The only improvement to be made was the ability to join games with friends as a party.  Was this added?  No, they completely innahalated the original multiplayer system and replaced it with a piece of crap system that hasn't been taken seriously since Counter Strike.  I can't think of any other mainstream game that has been set up this way, and the ones that are have campaigns and all sorts of other features that keep the game afloat.  But it doesn't stop there, not only is the multiplayer system awful, the dedicated servers are completely broken, so all respectable servers are local.  That's right player hosted games on a game that dares to call itself multiplayer.  I don't need to tell you how ancient the concept of players hosting games it on a serious multiplayer game.

Now, let me say that I loathe hyperbole.  Bubsy 3D is not the worst game ever made, and believe me, I have played most of them.  Despite what the fifteen-year-old reviewers on Amazon would have you believe, Bubsy 3D actually won some acclaim when it was released, and retained what was, for the time, the 3D platforming status quo.  The problem with the status quo back then was that there wasn't one, and any given game might have any old control scheme, many of which didn't make any sense.  Bubsy 3D suffered from exactly that, among other things; namely, the overly simplistic environments and the sketchy depth perception.

And oh yeah, it suffered from one more thing: Super Mario 64 had completely blown the lid off of everyone's expectations.  Suddenly, simply average platformers made only months before suddenly looked like clunky, outdated dinosaurs.

And there was left poor old Bubsy.  The controls for the game are clunky at best, that much is certain, and it takes a while to learn his ropes.  His jumping mechanics are very different; the developers solved the depth-perception problem (partially, anyway) by having the camera switch to an overhead view whenever he jumps, giving the player overly precise control over where he lands, a la Jumping Flash.  Unfortunately, he takes so long to get a running start, he will probably slide right off of that platform you just landed on so precisely.  In fact, you will get to know the jumping controls extremely well, because you are going to fall off of that platform quite a bit.

One thing that still surprises me to this day, though, is the sharpness of the game's resolution.  No, there aren't hardly any textures to be found, as Bubsy's 3D world consists of purely colored geometric shapes, but I'll be darned if there isn't hardly a jaggy edge to them.  The characters and their expressions, as well as their animations, are actually really well defined, and the 2D sprites fail to pixelate.  Its just too bad that they all live in a world created by the God of Playskool.

Bubsy 3D is not one of the worst games ever made.  It is simply one of the most unfortunate, a rushed product shoved to the front lines to catch as much residual success off of its competitors as it could.  To understand that, you had to have been there in 1996, when platformers were anybody's game.  When Mario grew up he changed all that, and invited us along for his joyous adventure, from which we never looked back.

Ubi's version of Prince of Persia came as a surprise last year, because this franchise had so many bad sequels that nobody really thought it still has a future. But, Ubi managed to create an excellent game, with a distinct look and excellent controls and level design. They also brought and implemented perfectly the concept of 'controlling time', thus avoiding the main complaints about the POP games (most of them dealt with frustrating jumping puzzles and instant death).

Unfortunately though, even if it was a critic darling, Sands of Time (SoT) did not sell as expected - mostly the effect of having so many bad sequels. So, for the second installment on XBox, Ubi was forced to listen to the 'complaints' and change the game. This though is the main problem with this sequel. While changes tend to be good in general, these ones do not apply.

The main change is the fighting system. Warrior Within (WW) made the transition from a Tomb Raider type of gameplay to a Ninja Gaiden one. For some, this may be a blessing and especially early magazine reviewers seem to enjoy it. To me though, this pretty much ruined the game. From an intelligent and interesting game, this became nothing else than random button pressing, trying to get the 'perfect' combo. I would have preffered to have more exploration, not a Mortal Kombat fighting. In fact, PoP always seemed to be more about avoiding traps and solving puzzles, than about doing combos. And while the fighting system in SoT was indeed flawed, at least it was not a big part of the game. Now - like it or not - you will have to either learn these combos or avoid the game entirely.

The second change is with the graphics. What made SoT so special was its distinct look and gorgeous graphics. WW should have improved on this, but instead this is a step back. The 'blur' effect and vivid colors are gone, replaced by two colors: black and brown. The game looks common and uninteresting and the lack of 'blur' makes the textures look very poor. Why would Ubi change - again - something that was working, still a mystery to me. Especially now, when the 'blur' effect is copied in all games (Fable being the latest).

In the end, it looks like a group of players and reviewers changed the direction this game was following and WW is the end product. While some may enjoy this changes, for the fans of exploration and solving puzzles, this is a major step back. To me, this game was dumbed down to appeal to the masses and in the process, it lost its identity.

I will not buy this game, but I hope the sequel - if there will be any - will return to its roots, as captured in SoT.",Change is not always good,1098921600,7,{'Platform:': ' Xbox'},

2.0,False,"02 15, 2008",AFLAMNNZE674A,B000FQBPCQ,Big Daddy V,"All these five star reviews seem to completely lack objectivity. Everyone keeps saying it's amazing and is the best Zelda ever. This just isn't true. First of all, amazing compared to what? GTA, Final Fantasy, or Shenmue? The game has midi music, no live voices, average graphics, and an unrealistically small overworld with 1-3 street towns, forests without any trees in your way. Is this ""amazing"" compared to a whole state with three cities composed of dozens of blocs, hundreds of people and vehicles, like in GTA: San Andreas? This game pales in video game standards compared to even Shenmue I, Final Fantasy X, and GTA 3 which came out 5-6 years before it.

Futhermore, the game seems to ignore most of the progress the Zelda franchise made since LttP. LttP had 12 dungeons, 4 swords, 3 shields, 20 items, and magic power with lots of spells. TP only has 8.5 dungeons, 2 swords, 2 shields, 12 items, and no magic at all. Ocarina introduced integration of a musical instrument to the gameplay. This element is lacking in TP. Majora's Mask introduced very extensive gameplay before you enter the dungeon, and extensive character interaction and sidequests. All of this is significantly scaled back in TP. Also, whereas in MM, you could transform into three different forms that could hover, roll, or swim rapidly underwater, in TP, you only transform into a wolf that can't do much. Wind Waker introduced an overworld that was realistically large and integrated, meaning it was all one piece--not a bunch of areas with load times between them. TP overworld is smaller than WW's, is fragmented into small areas, and often doesn't match. For example, if you look at Hyrule Castle from the ground, the rooftops you scaled to reach Zelda aren't there. Finally, most Zelda games had a unique feature/ability. MM had masks, Oracle Games had seeds and rings, Minnish Cap had Kinship Stones, etc.  TP has nothing like that.  So how is it that a game that came out years after its predecessors on Nintendo's most powerful console yet actually REGRESSED in amount of equipment, number of dungeons, overworld size, etc.!? LttP made a huge leap over Zelda II, and OoT made a huge leap over LttP. These games were among defining for their time. TP made little progress over N64 games or Wind Waker, and feels a generation behind contemporary games like Final Fantasy XII or GTA: San Andreas.

The story is strange, too. You don't really learn anything about the Legend of Zelda/Hyrule. The story is all about Midna and Zant, which is frustrating, since TP was supposed to be the spiritual successor to the OoT. Also, the weird cybernetic twilight world with floating square particles, wormholes, and Zant's castle that looks like inside of a computer REALLY clashes with Zelda's medieval theme. Other than the postman from Majora's Mask, there are no characters from other Zelda games, no fairy fountains, no pissed off chickens, no magic, nothing recognizeable, really.  So it just doesn't have much Zelda charm. WW was a tropic island adventury with cartoony graphics, but with recognizable Zelda elements, a new chapter to the Hyrule legend, and strong interaction between Link, Zelda, and Ganondorf, it felt like a Zelda much more than this one.

Also, there is little innovation here.  Other than the horseback combat system, which was awesome, nothing here is really new.  Also, collecting three things, and then collecting five more things is getting pretty old by this point, especially on a 3-D system.  Can't Nintendo come up with a more involving storyline?

Finally, this all would have been okay if the game were really fun. But it's not. For the first three dungeons, you discover big new areas, but the action is boring.  As a wolf, you run around deserted black-and-white areas killing bugs.  Human action is a little better, but there's little of it.  Soon after the third dungeon, you don't go back and forth between twilight and light, and you barely play as the wolf.  Also, the action between dungeons becomes shorter and shorter. After fifth dungeon, you don't discover any new places (except one one-street town) and don't do anything except maybe a couple of really tedious fetch quests or repeats of the early quests. The dungeons themselves are okay. Only walking on walls and ceiling in the Goron Mines and the enitre City in the Sky felt above and beyond what we've seen before. Otherwise, they're too strait-forward and the puzzles too simple. Also, the design isn't very crisp and their theme (interaction with fire, water, etc) isn't developed as well as before. The fire dungeon is a weird combination of mechanical mines, caves, and docks, and the water dungeon has only slightly more water in it than the fire dungeon. The Temple of Time is a complete rip off of the Wind Waker's Tower of Gods. The mini-bosses and the bosses in this game are the best of any Zelda games, although too easy, and they still just wait for Link to hit them.

So, overall, for me the game was a disappointment. And before people discard my opinion because I don't love the game and write how I must be an Xbox or PS fan or that I haven't actually played this game, know that I don't even own these systems and that I played almost every Zelda game, including this one (2.5 times).

I did an internet search on this issue. This issue seems common and may impact at least a million machines, out of three million initially sent out. So, the odds are, as they were for me, that you might get a defective machine.

To be fair, COD MW3 does what it sets out to do and that is to complete the story arc established in the first 2 games.

What it fails to do:

1.  Graphic engine.  It still looks great, don't get me wrong.  But when DICE updates their own engine (Frostbite 2) to make lighting and texture improvements look slick, Infinity Ward (or what's left of them after the Kotick debacle) fails to update anything significant.
2.  Story.  The single player's story is wrapped up but, again, it's short.
3.  Multiplayer.  My biggest gripe.  I recently played with 3 people LOCALLY on a 4-player split screen Death Match.  It looked blurry.  I'm almost ashamed to say that Black Ops actually looked a little sharper.  That's a major OUCH for me to say.  The whole ""kill confirmed"" mode, while a novelty aimed at reducing campers, is not that much more significant than, say, blades of grass in EA's Madden 12.  It's kind of an ""oooo"" for a few seconds, then I'm looking for the other novelties...and they're not there.

I won't dwell on the complaints too much.  Others have done a remarkable job covering that here.  Is it a 1-star game?  No, although this game has polarized its audience unlike COD titles before.  It's 2.5 stars at best, and future releases have a long way to go to earn my trust again.  I paid under forty dollars for it, and I'm 100% glad that I didn't pay full price.  At a full price, this title would have been a travesty.

Bobby Kotick is falling into the same routine again of relying on the coat-tails of previous good work to carry his cash cow forward.  The same thing was evidenced in the swan song of the Guitar Hero franchise, which Kotick had the audacity to blame DJ Hero for.  Yeah, DJ Hero killed Guitar Hero...it had nothing to do with the 3-4 releases of Guitar Hero each year.

That said, COD has grown into such a monster that Kotich is unlikely to see past the black accounting values to realize that he will ultimately make a fatal error...again.  Why no one deposes this clown in his own company is beyond me.

It's sad since I loved COD MW 1 & 2 immensely.  While COD MW3 provided a cathartic ending, it seems like a death rattle to me.  Infinity Ward is not the name of quality that I once knew.

You play Takkar, a Wegna hunter sent to the land of Oros to find other Wenga for <REASONS HERE>, because <MORE REASONS HERE>. And that is basically the whole of the plot. After arriving, you find the Udam, a Neanderthal like race from the north, and the Izali, a pyro race from the south, have both moved into the area, and you're only recourse is to wipe them out before they wipe you out. While story options were limited, there again is no real arc for the character. Takkar  never changes over even appears to have an independent thought, and has so little agency that after the first twenty minutes of the game, he literally doesn't choose to do anything afterwards, he's obeying one of the NPC's.

Graphics are lush and gorgeous. Far Cry and DUNIA basically will always get five stars. Surprisingly their fire animations are pathetic, which is odd because they'd done those well before. Areas are worth exploring just to look at them. (10/10)

Audio is meh. The music and background is almost non-existent, and no can't really use it in gameplay, as you'll see enemies by radar long before you hear them or see them as specks on the horizon. The voices and the basic language are a nice touch, and you actually start to pick up on a few words because everyone's speaking the same tongue.  (6/10)

Gameplay is Far Cry Lite. There's no merchants, no vehicles, mammoths taken from FC4, animals for 3 and 4. The only modification is that you can now tame the animals to use as companions, and while its a wonderful rush to tame a black jaguar the first time, they kill your stealth, and you're basically reduced to what you always are when assaulting bases: You dart the toughest boss guy in the village with a beserk dart, wait for him to mow through half his compatriots, and then arrow him in the head. This is the frustration is that nothing really was added, but some was taken away. No vehicles? Ok, but come on, no ones found a horse? No merchants? Ok, but how about village on village raids, rather than you stuck out in the middle of nowhere constantly on the Rambo path. (7/10). At least the side missions all have decent explanations, and the mystic vision quests continue to be fun diversions, but the New Ideas column of this was really weak.

Overall, more of the same. While that worked great for Far Cry 4, none of what made 4 wonderful is present. No funny and charming villain always in the background.

You can be a guy or a girl, and you can choose from a variety of car options. Once you get into the races, what you usually notice first is the rag doll physics of the drivers - as they get flung from their cars. Most racing games focus on the cars - but in this one, you can achieve gory death for yourself or others by the lack-of-seatbelt ejection.

I appreciated the different worlds you run in - on regular race tracks, on off-road dirt through forests, on snowy trails, and so on. However, everything seemed very ""muddy"" to me - and often it was hard to see on the screen what was road and what was brown near-road-but-not-driveable. Maybe their aim was to have all obstacles camoflagued, but in practice it made it not fun to drive towards an open spot and smash into something there.

So in general I wasn't keen on the graphics. Normally I love deformable objects, including cars. However, these cars didn't look like they were ""dented"" realistically. It seemed more like a plasic object had melted strangely.

The sounds were even worse. I was quite not-fond of most of the songs played in the soundtrack, and the RRRRR RRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRR of the cars must've been generated on a sound machine.

I didn't find the driving part to be that bad, and I do enjoy racing games in general. However, since I do own several other racing games, I'm not sure why I would put one of those down to play this instead.

So when I saw that Live 08 had made some big improvements over the disaster that was Live 07, I figured why not give it a chance.  While this game is significantly better than Live 07, it still isn't that great a basketball sim.  Certain animations seem to be missing making the game seem not as fluid as you would hope especially from a game running at 60 frames per second.  Dunk animations in particular are just not right.  Guys can go from running or standing still to a dunk in a very quick leap, essentially making the shot unblockable.  At best when someone dunks it's either a foul or a dunk.  Blocking the dunk is definitely not an option even with some of the best shotblockers in the league.  Also jumpshot animations really have no rhythm so it does not feel very fluid when shooting a jump shot.  Watching the game also isn't that fun. The way players move on the floor has a wonky feel to it, not like watching a real game.  All in all I'd have to stay skip this Live and pick up 2K8.  Even though 2K has its flaws, one being a terrible roster glitch that screws up all player match ups on defense, it is still a far better gameplay experience than Live.

This is really a very simple and plain electronic sudoku game.  The controls are pretty easy to figure out (I rented my copy).  There are a few categories of gameplay; for single player mode they are: classic for quick solo playing; arcade for timed playing; career for earning the title ""master of sudoku"" (it's just progressive play); and ""challenge Carol"" for timed difficult puzzles.  There is a multi-player mode; I didn't try that because nobody else has this game.

As a sudoku fan I found most of the games a little too easy.  But what really sucks about this game is it's really plain and no fun at all for anyone who's not into sudoku.

The first problem I found was how the game is a third person shooter with the exception of when you aim through the scope of the sniper rifle. The switching back and forth between third and first person is jarring and immersion breaking, and the handling of the third person aiming and cover mechanics are rather poor.

Beyond that, the campaign missions are formulaic, repetitive, and extremely linear. Enemy AI is laughably poor and generic, offering little challenge even on higher difficulty levels once you recognize their patterns. Weapon selection is almost non-existent, and the choices you make in what extra equipment to carry are generally superfluous due to searching enemy bodies and abundant ammo drops.

The one bright spot for me was the close-up/X-ray kill camera, but even that grew old after seeing them so many times.

The first play-through was alright until you realize how repetitive it was. There's also a problem with the difficulty scaling I think. On the first play-through the game was almost too easy and then on the next difficulty the game is way too hard. I think part of that has to do with how terrible the loot is. 95% of the loot you find is worse than the same equipment you found ages ago and 99% of the loot is for a different class then you're playing. I beat Diablo 3 Inferno difficulty and the loot I got after the Diablo boss fight was a joke.

This product originally caught my interest due to it having 4 shoulder buttons instead of the original 3 on the Gamecube controller while still retaining identical aesthetics of it as well. It was also far cheaper so i bought it. Once i recieved the package and played for a few minutes, it became obvious as to why this was much cheaper than a Gamecube controller. Although it looked incredibly similar to a Gamecube controller, that was where the similarities ended. The weight of the controller is very light, as this is due to the fact it doesnt have a rumble device in it. The control sticks, buttons, and shoulder triggers all feel clucky and cheap. It was difficult to make prescise button presses at high speeds. The buttons also made loud clicking noises that were louder than your typical controller. You also need to press down on the buttons harder than other controllers for them to actually retract and register. The shoulder buttons are sometimes inconsistent at detecting input, not because they aren't detected, but because you need to press hard on them at a specific angle.

I actually got a lot more enjoyment out of it than I was expecting.  The art style is generally charming.  The story (what I got of it) is fairly interesting.

The puzzles range from very easy, to absurdly hard, though there's a general progression of easier to harder puzzles as the game progresses.  I found many of the puzzles fun, some annoying, but solvable, and a decent chunk either no fun at all, or impossible for me to figure out.

The way the game is structured, one usually has the ability to skip puzzles that one is stuck on-but unfortunately not always.  I had to give up finally on a puzzle somewhere past the halfway mark.

On a *very* ""nit-picky"" technical note, I did find the load time between screens a bit annoying as I progressed.  It's only a couple of seconds, but it adds up.

It's glitchy as hell and the controls are so bad it makes the platforming parts of the game just an annoyance rather than fun. The upgrade system blows. There is no chapter restart so if you screw up you can't just restart the chapter. Instead you are screwed loading to the same point in the game every time. You would have to restart the entire game to go back to the beginning of a chapter. You can't replay cut scenes so don't press start or leave the room. Also there are moments that make no logical sense. Like, why is a gatling gun offered (across an arena) in assistance to killing a gatling gun boss when it can't actually kill him (the devs clearly didn't learn from Gears of War)? Instead he'll limp for about 8 seconds and you have to somehow manage to get across the arena to activate the quicktime event that will finally kill him, because if you don't he'll recover and shot the hell out of you. Prior to this arena battle the gatling gun bosses were all able to be killed without activating a quicktime event and sadly this part didn't happen till Chapter 12 (the final level). And to be honesty the game was actually decent up until Chapter 7. In Chapter 7 the difficulty suddenly shots through the roof, because somehow the bad guys are more resistant to bullets (including headshots). Also the platforming increases. Now, the platforming was always a pain, but it wasn't as frequent so the game loses a lot of what was fun when this happens. This game had a ton of potential. The grindhouse style in presentation is awesome. The graphics are really bad for a current generation title, but could actually be overlooked if the gameplay was better. Going from run and gun to sword slashing melee is a great idea, just not well executed. Bottom line, glitches and gameplay kill this game, which is sad because the story is really fun.

I'll do the GOOD/BAD review.
Installing:
Uuugh. If you have Vista, prepare for one blocked attempt after another. It took MANY tries to find the patch to download and finally restart my computer and finally play.
Opening:
Good: not much
Bad: The building of a character was very minimal. Not a whole lot of room for changing your character. I guess I got too used to Oblivion.
Tutorials:
Good: Not much
Bad: As you are dropped into your first screen, the tutorials last about 3 seconds and fade away before you can realize what you just read.
Game play:
Good: At first I thought, nice, one hit zombies that get harder to kill and enemies changed somewhat quickly with each task you are sent on.
Bad: The same monsters are all identical. One zombie looks exactly like another. YOUR character movements are very stiff. No, you can not free roam around. In order to go to a new zone, you have to accept a task to go there. Right and Left mouse click seemed to do almost the same attack. Nothing special there too.
Overall:
If you love games like Titan Quest and Dungeon Seige, have fun. It's like they tried to mix them with Oblivion.

As usual the controls can be frustrating due to being unresponsive but it's Ubisoft  what do you expect? The use of micropays in the game is slimy but I'm afraid that is the direction the industry is going. If your a fan of the games you'll enjoy this latest entry. Being able to play different assassins is a great idea. Each has his/her strengths that can be leveraged in any situation.  Again fans of the game will enjoy it
Updated to the above review.  From 4 to 2 stars. Game ripe with glitches and the controls make the game tedious and remove the joy of playing the game. At times the controls prove such an issue it makes the mission harder than it should be. Speaking of the missions, in an effort to add variety the makers added associates who give the assassins missions to complete. These missions feel repetitive and what really separates them is the terrible controls. Wondering if the character is going to respond correctly is the only surprise. Frustrating,  very very frustrating.....
The best of this game is the visuals, the city itself not the characters. I believe Ubisoft has put out 9 or ten games and still can't get the characters right( or the controls for that matter).The quality is NO different from what we saw in the games on the Xbox 360. The game shines because the city looks amazing.

2.0,False,"02 16, 2011",A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B004BJ4HDC,Lisa Shea,"A spiritual successor to the Dungeon Keeper series, ""Dungeons"" gives a good attempt but misses out on a lot of the things that made DK great.

Like Dungeon Keeper, Dungeons is a game about, well, building a dungeon. In DK, the goal was to set up an ecosystem by keeping monsters happy, harvesting gold, and killing heroes who intruded on your underground lair. ""Dungeons"" takes a different approach: the goal is to make the heroes happy, thus raising their ""soul energy"", and then killing them when they're happiest. Therefore, while DK focused on building different rooms to accommodate your monsters, ""Dungeons"" has rooms to attract heroes based on their differing needs.

There are three major resources in Dungeons. The first of these is ""prestige"", which is gained by placing atmospheric items, such as flickering torches, dusty coffins, and piles of bones, around your dungeon. Building up prestige unlocks new items and objects. The second resource is ""souls"", which is gained by killing happy heroes and is used to build prestige items. The third resource is gold, which is used to buy things like monsters and room accessories, but can also be set out as a lure for heroes (though it's best to kill them before they escape the dungeon with it).

One thing that bothers me about Dungeons is that the setup leaves little room for creativity. Unlike Dungeon Keeper, where rooms served a direct purpose, the purpose of rooms in Dungeons is to lure in heroes - warriors will try to steal things from armories, wizards will peruse libraries, and...that's about it. There's no sense that you're actually building a working dungeon, it's just a dungeon-themed park. Monsters show up as guards or speed-bumps for the heroes, but their involvement in gameplay is limited to plopping down a spawn point. There's no sense of actual management, which makes it tactically limited.

Most of the ""choices"" the game offers have to do with a new addition to the game - your avatar. This is an armored, Sauron-like fellow who the player upgrades with better stats and spells. The majority of upgrades apply to him - carrying out sub-objectives grants him better stats and more spells, and not much else. This character receives far more focus than he ought to, especially given how limited the actual dungeon-building is. He feels totally unnecessary - all the upgrades that go to him should instead go to the dungeon, which is far too limited as it is.

The game looks and sounds reasonably nice, but it's just impossible to get into it. It feels like a waste - they made all these nice graphics and designs, and then threw them into really awful gameplay. The dynamic is so simple that it's ridiculously easy to run out of things to do, so the game just builds up more and more in terms of levels without adding anything of substance. Overall, I wanted to like Dungeons, but it just wasn't going to happen. Fans of Dungeon Keeper should understand that there's really nothing that the games have in common except for the fact that they both take place in dungeons.

If the PS3 system is turned off and then you start it up. The fans are squealing like crazy. It took about 36 hours of use for this to happen. The squealing stops in about 5 minutes and the fans sound and run normal.

The temperature system works great. when the systems heats up the fans turn on and stay on until you turn the PS3 system off. Once you turn the PS3 system off the fan system is still checking temps which is great and it will turn back on for a short time until it is cool. So far it only turns on once after the Initial shutdown of the PS3 then shuts right back off within 2-3 minutes.

Not that Siren is a bad game; quite the opposite. It's just that there are far better examples of survival horror and tactical infiltration games available than this.
I'll explain.
The Plot, briefly, concerns a handful of survivors who have to get out of a small inland Japanese town, which, for reasons yet unknown, is now overrun with Zombies and other such nasties. In the time-honoured Survival Horror tradition, you must employ various keys, guns and whatever else is handy to make good your escape.
The graphics are beautiful in places, and, even at their worst, still do the job nicely. Sound is good, even if the voice acting is sometimes a little hammy, but certainly isn;t half as bad as some people would have you believe.
So far, so predictable.
Where Siren differs from others in this vein is in its approach to the gameplay, and this is both good and bad. The story is played out in a series of short-ish Missions or Chapters - and there is a new ability to 'Sightjack' - to see from the point of view of any enemies or allies in the immediate vicinity. Both of these ideas are excellent, and a welcome change to a genre where, if the story's no good, neither is the game. Sightjacking, in particular, adds a new and creepy dimension to the proceedings - Log onto an enemy to see if they can see you, and wait for your reaction :-)
Similarly refreshing is the fact that your characters are as brittle as real-life people. They cannot fight or shoot very well, or generally stand up to much physical punishment at all. This too adds huge amounts of tension to an already atmospheric and chilling scenario.
And, if the control system wasn't such a yowling, sluggish, disobedient dog of a mess, then 'Siren' would rank alongside Fatal Frame and Silent Hill 2 as an all-time Great. Sadly, this isn't the case, and trying not to smash your expensive PS 2 pad against the wall/console/friend/whatever is nearest at the time becomes the greatest challenge in completing the game. It's woeful - slow and unresponsive, and, in a game where fifty per cent of your chances of survival hinge on your ability to react quickly to unexpected scenarios, this is a huge, unfair problem.
I can't give this game 5 stars, much and all as the new additions and innovations are highly commendable. If you are a patient person with the stomach for oftentimes-repetitive gameplay, then Siren is for you. If not, then go with Fatal Frame 2 or wait for Silent Hill 4.",Huh.,1084838400,6,,

The iron minor brings iron ore into town which a blacksmith will pick up, and turn into swords, which will be used by your fighting men paid for by the taxes of everyone on this chain.

It's the social chains like this that make Settler RoE a unique game.  And this is essentially what settlers is all about; building up these chains as best you can. The game has a good campaign as well; every mission is different while the basic principal remains the same: keep your people fed, clothed, clean, and happy. Basically, it's sort of like civilization, but focusing on one town.
As a bonus, once the campaign is over, you can play any number of ""free-settlement"" maps, were your goal is to build the best city possible, while others have a specific goal (How long can you hold out under a barons taxation before revolting?) . Also, a downloadable map-builder and bonus maps should create some interesting opportunities for replay ability.

I've checked it out and here is the deal.

The Deluxe gives you:
1) 24 GB more memory than a basic.  Of course, you can add a cheap USB drive and duplicate this.
2) A cradle for charging, but, the battery on my video remote isn't lasting long so I usually have the video remote plugged directly into the wall (because you can't play when its in the cradle!). So the cradle is not worth any extra money.
3) NintendoLand, which you can buy separately.  Nintendoland is a suite of mini games.  Nintendoland does a good job of introducing you to everything the Wii U can do.  If you love minigames, maybe you should buy the deluxe.  If you just want dedicated titles like ""ZombiU"" or ""Pikmin 3"" then you might choose the basic Wii.  After 2 weeks my daughter wants us to buy another game, because none of the mini games in Nintendo Land are very deep, and some are about as good as a $1 game you'd buy in an app store.  (race game, balloon game, yoshi game: I'm talking to you)
4) The Deluxe also gives you 10% back on all digital purchases, for each $50 you spend.  So to get $5 back, you have to spend $50.  Most people I know prefer to buy hard copies of their game so they can resell or trade them.  But if you like to buy software online then you would want to get the deluxe.

You would want to consider the basic Wii U if:
1) You don't like minigames (aka Nintendoland)
2) You only buy hard copies of games.

Otherwise, consider the deluxe.

In regards to the memory:  A 32GB memory stick will run you about $15-25, in fact, you wouldn't even know this one was there:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SanDisk-Cruzer-Fit-CZ33-32GB-USB-Flash-Drive-SDCZ33-032G-B35/dp/B00812F7O8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SanDisk Cruzer Fit CZ33 32GB USB Flash Drive (SDCZ33-032G-B35)</a>.  And you get to keep that USB drive even if you get rid of your Wii U.

You will see in the comments that someone claims the SanDisk won't work on the wii, but, I'm using one right now.  What can I say?  One test is worth 1,000 expert opinions...  Installing the SanDisk was easy.  In my case, I inserted it when the Wii U was off.  Then I turned the Wii U on and it said ""There is a new USB drive... do you want to format it and yes it?"" I hit the button that said ""yes"" and it was set up just like that!

I'm a positive person in general, so I will be happy with my 32GB, but, if you are considering the 8GB, take heed.

If you are on the fence about the wii U, here is my main review:

I remember that Nintendo came under a lot of criticism for not having an HD version of the Wii. HD was around when the first Wii came out, and a lot of people were a bit skeptical that they stuck to the lower resolution. As HD became common, Nintendo told fans that they had to do something ""more"" than just come out with an HD version of the Wii.

Well, thats just what Nintendo did. The Wii U is more than ""just Wii HD"". But Nintendo hasn't changed the Wii experience very much. You still use Wii remotes every time you play. The Wii U is not ""completely different"" like the Wii was when it came out. The Wii U is the Wii's younger, smarter brother. And if you liked the Wii, you'll like the Wii U.

The 3 main features of the Wii U are:
1) Its HD, which brings it (finally) up to speed with the Xbox and Playstation ... and everything else out there.
2) The Wii U has a single video controller. The video controller opens up new game experiences. Whoever is playing on the video controller sees something different than the other players. For generations people have wanted multiplayer games that didn't use a ""split TV screen"", and the Wii U gives you that in one console. This is a really big deal. The video controller is also a touchscreen which you use to flick something at the screen, or move things on screen. The new video controller allows for new control options ... just like the ""Wii balance board"" allowed Nintendo to sell yoga and ski games.
3) Videos, videos, videos. Netflix, youtube, TiVo, amazon instant video. It will keep track of the TV shows you want to watch, and when they will be on. You'll also be able to use the Wii U as a social outlet to chat about TV shows and movies. Nintendo calls this Wii TVii, and it would be a revolution in TV watching... if only all the features were available now. So you can use the Wii U as a control for all your Video experiences with your TV. The video controller will act like ""PIP Picture in Picture in the palm of your hand"". I use the Wii U with Amazon Video to watch movies for free, and the Wii remote lets me see information about the movie on IMDB WHILE the movie is playing. For sports, you'll be able to watch instant replays on the small screen... while the rest of your buddies continue to watch the big game on the main screen. So its going to be a remote controller on steroids. To be honest, this is going to be a really big big deal but since not all the features roll until ""later"" I can't give the WIi U a star for it yet. Maybe it will change your life, maybe not. Time will tell.

And that concludes the main appeal of the Wii U. We finally get HD, the video controller adds a new dimension to the usual Wii gaming, and it also serves as a ""TV command center"".

FAQ:::Some people have asked me about the Wii U, and the short answers are:
1) No, you don't have to own a Wii to have a Wii U.
2) You can only use ONE video controller with your Wii U. All other players use the old Wii remote.
3) 5 people can play at once, making it even more of a ""game party"" console than before.
4) You can't play DVDs or Blu Ray discs. Blue Ray is Sony Playstation territory, as you probably know.
5) You can surf the internet on it (why would you want to? I don't know)
6) Should I get the deluxe? Probably. You get 32gb of memory, which will become more important the longer you have the console, and the more you do with it. You get the Nintendo Land game. You get the cradle for charging the video gamepad. And until 2014 they will give you a store credit of 10% every time you make a purchase of digital content (games). If you buy digital content regularly, you might ""earn back"" the extra $50 you pay for the deluxe Wii U. (I tried this yesterday, read below for more info on the credit)

The Wii U has a host of ""lesser"" features:
1) A person can play the Wii U without having the TV on. Expect a smack on your head if you want to play ZombiU while your wife watches a movie.
2) Its backwards compatible with all older Wii games (but maybe not dance pads!), which is nice if you bought Zelda Skyward Sword this summer.
3) Just as with the old Wii, you can download games from the Nintendo store. If you buy online content for your iPhone, Xbox, or PS3, you know that this is a big deal. I used to buy songs for guitar hero to add to the songs that came in the box. If you buy this DELUXE version, you get a 10% credit back for all online purchases, see more about this credit in ""The Bad"" below.
4) The Wii U video controller is like a universal remote. You can turn on your TV and change the volume from the gamepad which is a convenience.
5) Most of the old Wii hardware is compatible too, which is nice, EXCEPT that round ""gamecube style"" connector is not present on the Wii U. Games that use a mat like ""outdoor challenge"" and ""Dance Dance Revolution"" become history in your house.
6) There is a big, easy to find ""download again"" button for all digital content, so if your Wii U got fried by a power surge you wouldn't lose your purchases. That's always nice.

The bad:
1) The menus aren't intuitive. There are two menus... the Wii U menu and the Home menu. The Home menu is found by pressing the Home button. Note that now that downloads are automatic, the unintuitive menus aren't so bad. But they still seem redundant.
2) Transferring data from the Wii to the Wii U should be easier. In particular I didn't like that when I imported my Miis, I had to do a separate step on the Wii U before I could actually use them in the games. The day I got it the patch took way too long to download and install, and after I transferred my data from my Wii I felt like I had spent 2 hours on the whole thing. But, since then, there has been no problem.
3) Freezing. I did have a problem with NintendoLand locking up, but, that went away after one day. This will be something they fix and becomes a thing of the past. I wouldn't sweat it.
4) Long updates. I feel that the time that it takes to download stuff and install it has improved over time.
5) Installing downloaded content. I wrote a long rant about how annoying this was, but as of the most recent update you can buy items in the store and they download and install automatically, as they should.

Ok now that I'm done complaining...

Your decision matrix:
1) If you still like playing on your Wii, and you have the money to spend, buy a Wii U and sell your Wii. You'll enjoy it.
2) If you are considering between an Xbox+Kinect and a Wii U, I think its a tough call. I really like the ""second screen"" gaming, it really opens up a lot of possibilities. But most of the wii U stuff looks really juvenile. The kid down the street told me he still wanted an Xbox because the Xbox has games for teenagers. I said ""whatev.""
3) As a side note, every kid who has seen and played our Wii U in the last two weeks has put this as the top item on the Christmas list. Its the ""next big thing"" for them and you can be sure that the little things that I complain about in this review won't matter to them. Not at all.

Games: Nintendo now has decent amount of digital content to buy online. I paid .35 for ""kirby's great adventure"" or something like that. Its a grainy looking old game, but it was only thirty five cents. Nintendo has started offering games at the $2, $5, and $8 price points as well. I'm VERY pleased to see this, because I want to be able to log into the shop and grab a game for cheap when I want to.

I rate this item 3 stars out of 5 because three stars means ""it's ok"". Nintendo has made a lot of improvements in 6 months, and while they have fixed most of the problems with the system, I find myself reluctant to raise the review to 4 stars until some more exclusive games are released. Pikmin 3 has been delayed until August, for example.

The Wii U is getting better. I think it may turn into my favorite console of all time, if they can just get some good exclusive games out, and improve the use of the video controller in those games. I really don't want another game where the video controller shows a map. Gimmie a break.",Maybe I shoulda bought the 8GB version.,1354147200,657,,

The item box is blue color with Grand Turismo 6. The item in the amazon is still the old box with red Grand Turismo 5 picture.
This I know that I'm getting new item for a GREAT AMAZON deal at 400$.

YET!!!!! don't judge the book by its cover.

This new batch of T500RS is DEAD ON ARRIVAL. It doesn't want to finish the auto calibration. The wheel keep spinning to the left and to the right back and forth non stop. I updated the FIRMWARE and DRIVER from Thrustmaster.com and it still keep doing that non stop left right spinning unfinished auto calibration. I went to the forum, and found the suggested solution.

[...]
press Ctrl-F and search for non stop auto calibration loop in the link provided above.

Please note that
Today is END OF 2015, and the forum link posted in the review is from 2006.

it still does NOT fix the unfinished auto calibration phase. Seems like it's the same F-ing problems from that in 2006.
maybe the motor has some issue.

Call amazon for replacement, and it confirmed that Amazon will send it and it will arrive by Dec 29, 2015.
Thrustmaster 1 stars.
Amazon 5 stars plus plus.

I will update the review. keep my finger crossed that the replacement item will not be defective. Because I KNOW that Thrustmaster makes a very good flight joystick A10 Warthog replica with a very high star ratings.

Somehow, Thrustmaster needs to find a better manufacturer that makes the product for them.

Update
2015.12.25

So I put T500RS back into the box. Ready for the replacement, And play some other games.

And several hours later, I feel antsy for die trying on the T500RS again. And set it up on my desk, and plug the USB back into my PC front side.

And whalllaaaa... thing works like magic, auto calibration works normaly now.

it makes me think what did I do wrong? because, I DID restart my PC right after firmware and driver update, but It didn't work back then.

So I guess it's just my luck. or maybe something related to the cache in my PC memory? I don't know. let's hope it doesn't break again tomorrow and many years after.

Star increased to 4. NOT 5, it should have been plug and play without giving any trouble from the start.

Update 2015.12.25 evening
T500RS auto calibration gimme another trouble again. Back to non stop spinning left and right. I did the solution above by turning off and on then plug usb again.,This time it still doesn't work.

half an hour later, I found second solution. How?

Press the MODE button (the red or green LED located at the left bottom of the servo base). HOLD it, then plug the USB back into the PC. it works now.

sigh... Thrustmaster!!! do something will you... 600$ item and NEW.... should be JUST plug and play, RIGHT? YOU HEAR ME?

Does it worth 4 stars at the price $400 Amazon deals? I don't think so... 3 Stars:
(1 star for realistic feeling gameplay + 1 star JUST for the look + 1 star for Amazon deals = Total of 3 Stars)

NEGATIVE 2 stars for giving me trouble and my wasted time for doing research in the forum and keep worrying if the product will fail again on me big time 3 months later just like those experienced by other T500RS owner in the Amazon review).

Well, it also looks like Nintendo has announced a new console to likely come out in two years. That doesn't mean they're dropping support for the Wii U, but it certainly looks like another bastard love-child of Nintendo they'd prefer to basically not talk about. Buy the console super cheap, and its not a bad deal; Nintendo made some decent HD versions of their games. But that's about all this console is really good for, and for my own usage, that amounts to about 5 or 6 games that are really worthwhile. Also, Zelda is pushed back, again, and many are speculating they will do a dual-release for the Wii U and the upcoming console, so its really not looking like anything further amazing is coming to this console. Get this console super cheap, and enjoy the unique gamepad and a few pretty decent Nintendo games and you'll probably be a happy camper. But don't get this console and think it can compare to the other next-gen consoles; it just won't have a fraction of the (enjoyable and well-rounded) libraries the other systems have, nor will it have the media hub capabilities those consoles have. If you love games, this is a good addition to another console, if you can afford it, but even though I'm not trying to pick sides in the ""console war"" (because that's just stupid), I own all 3 consoles, and for my own usage, I recommend the PS4, followed closely by the One, with a far distant recommendation for the U. Your mileage may vary, but this is MY opinion.

***Update 9/1/2015***

Well despite the very vocal commenters, I'm still not raising the star rating of this console. Its been pretty lack-luster and gets zero use from either my wife or myself. I purchased a PS4 that's been in pretty much constant usage. I don't think the Wii U is a terrible console in the least, but it doesn't offer enough in comparison to the PS4 for my usage. A few of the games are great, they are Nintendo games, and are mostly updates of their past games (not necessarily a bad thing, but not exactly 'innovative' either). 3rd party support will be pretty much non-existent for the Wii U; it has been already, and will continue to be. There will be very limited, if any, additional ports from major developers to the Wii U. If you have to have the latest Nintendo games/consoles, then there's no need to read my review. But if you're looking for a general-purpose game system, I'd definitely lean towards the other two major consoles instead. The Wii U is a less than ideal entertainment hub; not a deal-breaker, but something to note. The Nintendo games are pretty much the only exclusive and good games on the console, and even those I think get more praise then they really deserve (they're too difficult to really be beginner games, my wife can't play half of them, super mario is way more difficult than the old NES version, and the rest are too cutesy/boring to be adult games). If you get this, you miss out on countless excellent games, not just console exclusives as third-party developers don't want to port to the Wii U (there are very interesting articles written as to why that is by the programmers themselves), to pick up like a dozen decent ones (but those depend on your tastes of course, I dislike most of them as they have minimal or childish stories to tell). Again, if you're a major Nintendo fan, than don't even look at reviews and just keep buying their products, go for it, I'm not trying to discourage you from enjoying yourselves. But for those like myself who were on the fence about it, take the praise you see here with some grain of salt and realize there are plenty of reasons why everyone outside of the Nintendo fan club doesn't really support or talk about this console. There's nothing wrong with the console, but there's not a whole lot that's right either. Maybe when they finally release a proper Zelda game I might change my tune slightly, but for now, Mario Kart and Super Mario were really the only games I enjoyed on the console and those are fundamentally the same things you've played in the past, just with better graphics.

***Original Review***

First off, I think the console has amazing potential, and the console itself is great. But obviously these reviews should be for the console, and thus should be 4-5 stars, right? Well, you're not just buying a console, you're buying a proprietary ecosystem, just like when you buy a phone or a tablet. And as a recent purchaser of a Wii U, it seems Nintendo is hell-bent on screwing up the Wii U for NA customers as much as possible.

I write this review as a warning to others, because I didn't have time to sit around and read 500 different forums on the topic. While the games are excellent and the console is excellent, everything from pricing, to availability, to communication is terrible with the Wii U. First, every game is right around $50-$60 still, and many of them are actually HIGHER than when they came out! Apparently there's some wacky stocking issue with everything Nintendo is making, so scalpers are buying up everything from games to amiibos to rip people off. Seriously, go look at Wii Sports Club for the U, notice the currently $70 price tag here on Amazon? For a game that was FREE with the Wii?

Gamestop doesn't seem to carry used games regularly of the Wii U, so tough luck trying to save a few bucks that way. Or look on eBay, almost everything's right at retail value.

Controllers are still expensive, and with all the different periphreal options, its confusing as to what you do and don't need for various games. We purchased a Wii U Fit, and halfway through we find out you need two MotionPlus controllers for one person. Not a controller and nunchuck, because that would have made too much sense.

So the highlights of the console would of course be the beautiful HD, the console and gamepad themselves seem pretty solid (although the gamepad rattles, I believe due to its gyro sensor), and all the great Nintendo games. But the games themselves are few and far between, and I was shocked they didn't even include a simple game like Wii Sports with the console, I thought that would be a freebie/given with the console.

I feel like I may have made a mistake in buying this console, but I really wanted a console that my wife and I could play together, and she wants nothing to do with the average game, so for that, Nintendo still rules. But I also didn't expect to wind up paying more for the Wii U plus 3 games and 2 controllers as I would have for any of the other newer consoles plus a handful of games (because there are at least a dozen+ PS4 or Xbox One games that are below $20).

And I guess my biggest gripe is that all of this is already known and established by the community, but Nintendo refuses, in the least, to address supply issues, deal with scalpers, or offer sales on its titles or anything that might further promote the Wii U community. And now all that's in the Nintendo community are rapid fans who think even terrible decisions are the right decisions if they're made by Nintendo.","Good console, terrible ecosystem",1425600000,19,,

The premise sounded decent enough, and it seemed refreshing to see a Square-Enix game that didn't have a whiny teenage boy as the central character, so I figured I'd give it a shot.  From what I played (about 6-8 hours) of it, the story was pretty good, and the voice acting was decent as well.  I had to put the game down, however, because of the camera and play controls.  They were simply too frustrating for my tastes, and since this is an action-style RPG, I found that to be a deal-breaker.

Its respectable graphics and diverse selection of weapons/vehicles makes the game interesting to play, but the numerous flaws and glitches keep this third-person shooter from being truly interesting. A few of the features and flaws of the game are:

- Extremely linear play. Though the various advertisements promise an open world, the ""open world missions"" tend to be repetitive and generally fall into three categories: base capturing, target destruction/capture, and racing. The base capturing missions run out quickly, leaving players to do the less enjoyable target destruction missions. If you want to do the ""cool"" missions, you HAVE TO FOLLOW THE STORYLINE. As well, most of the storyline missions have to be completed in a specific way, and that can be EXTREMELY frustrating to players that want a more free-form game.

- Poor control via PC. The controls seem to have been intentionally muddled for PC users, as the mouse control is not nearly as smooth as it is in other games. This can be EXTREMELY frustrating until players get used to it.

- Large selection of vehicles. There are a lot of different types of vehicles to use, ranging from numerous tanks to multiple helicopters, and even a few different types of boats. Most of these can be stolen on the fly, so if you see one, you can usually take it away and use it with ease.

- Near invulnerability. Your mercenary is almost completely invulnerable to one-shot kills (such hits generally knock your health down to 2 instead of killing you). You heal quickly, so running in a zig-zag pattern until you can hide behind a boulder for a few seconds is usually enough to see you through any tight situation. This level of healing generally lends itself to a more-exciting action game, but will disappoint players interested in a realistic mercenary game.

Mercenaries 2 is definitely worth looking into if you want some quick escapist fun, but be prepared to get frustrated with missions on a regular basis (especially if you can't figure out the ""gimmick"" that will help you win it). I give this game three stars, as it is a decent PC-port of a console game that had its enjoyable moments of play.

The game has a small combination mix of the 5 mario games such as: super mario bros, super mario bros 2, super mario bros 3 (mostly), super mario world, and yoshies island. The game takes you back to the days where games were played on 2d platform sidescroll screen with the mix of the 5 mario games I mentioned earlier and they were pretty amazing but I think playing with 4 players together (never tried it) could be quite annoying and not fun.

*SPOILER ALERT*
Now for the real dissapointment for the consequencial buyers, The game is kinda short in 8 worlds which takes you quickly to the end depending how fast you beat the levels. But when you beat the game it leads you to a secret star world with harder levels which involves collecting all the star coins in every single level to beat star world which is not easy at all. And when you get all the coins in every level what do you get? absolutely nothing at all! Thats right all your hard work for nothing which was pretty dissapointing.

First of all unless you have hours to kill or you like buying warp wires all the time don't bother starting a game.  There's no quick save function, a feature that helped drastically when playing 2 and 3 on a lunch break. And on a related note, while there were many helpful shortcuts in 2 and 3 there are VERY few in this game, meaning you have to sludge through many weaker monsters just to get back to the point you wanted to go to.  This gets EXTREMELY tedious after a while.

Second, unlike 2 and 3 there were very few classes to choose from and because of the difficulty of the game, it favored certain classes *cough medic *cough over others.  Also the unlockable characters weren't made available until the way late into game, almost too late to even bother raising their levels.

3.0,False,"09 17, 2013",AJ2OU10N9SXF8,B00BWH0ZDW,Theology and video games ,"Let me kick this off by saying I loved Saints Row 2 and Saints Row: The Third, but Saints Row 4 somehow lost something. Let me start with the negatives before I move on to what I liked.

My biggest complaint about the game is that very early on, you earn super power abilities to jump higher than buildings and run faster than cars. And while that's pretty fun at first, having too much power really eliminates the very thing that makes games like this cool, and that's the driving and the city exploration.

With the ability to jump multiple tall buildings in a single leap, the various buildings of the city become nothing more than a series of obstacles to hurdle while enroute to your objective. This eliminates any character that the city itself may have had. But even so, the entire city looks very cookie cutter and has no real personality to it.

With the ability to run faster than cars.... what good are cars? Especially when you add on perks to your sprinting like force fields that eliminate any damage and toss away any cars that you run near. That's the entire foundation that games like this were built upon... DRIVING CARS! That's why the game that birthed this genre (Grand Theft Auto) is titled GRAND THEFT AUTO! But driving a car in this game is much less efficient than simply sprinting, jumping and gliding to your objective. So now you've eliminated another major aspect of what makes games like this fun!

In the developers' defense, many of the missions will eliminate your super powers and/or force you to drive vehicles, so in a limited way you do still get to experience the limitations that make a game challenging (and therefore fun), but the general theme of the game is that you're a super human bad-ass that's nearly impossible to kill. Call me crazy, but that's boring in my opinion.

My other complaint is the storyline. This is a double edged sword because the game is meant to be zany and unbelievable, which is part of what makes it fun and funny, but it also keeps you from having a vested interest in the characters or what happens to them. Again, it's watered down to a simple version of ""I'm going to complete this mission because it's how I advance the game, but that's the only real reason I'm doing it.""

Now on to the positives...

The game has a ton of variety on the little stuff. I don't think any game has ever had such a variety of weapons that actually DO various things. For example there's a Dubstep gun that kills enemies by basically filling them with bass until they die/explode. There's a Bounce Rifle that shoots a laser beam that will then bounce off the enemy and seek out other enemies. There's a gun that shoots black holes that then sucks in all enemies within it's radius and eliminate them from existence. There's a gun that you shoot to a spot on the ground and then aliens will come and beam up (and thus kill) all enemies in it's radius. That's on top of all your standard fare weapons like pistols, SMG's, Assault Rifles, Rocket Launchers, Shotguns, melee weapons, etc.

The game also has a nice variety of super powers that you use as weapons. You can shoot a ball of ice that will freeze enemies and then make them shatter Terminator 2 style. There's also a ground stomp that will launch enemies into the air, a power that allows you to add elements to your ammo, set people on fire merely by walking near them, a power that allows you to grab and throw objects telepathically, etc.

The game also has a big variety of side missions. You'll do everything from Text Adventure games to a 2D side scrolling ""Beat em Up"" similar to Streets of Rage. The Insurance Fraud side mission is back where you throw yourself in front of moving cars for money. There's also races on foot, platforming side missions, mayhem missions done in tanks and power armor (basically a big robot). and really too many to mention.

There's a huge variety of costumes you can wear although there doesn't seem to be a great deal of new material that wasn't present in Saints Row The Third.

The game is also really funny and references loads and loads of other video games and movies which is great.

All in all Saints Row 4 is a pretty solid game that does a ton of little things really well but forgets it's roots (driving cars and the character of the city itself) which really robs the game of it's punch and makes it more similar to Prototype or Crackdown than Saints Row 2 or 3 or the GTA series.",Limited game with the illusion of variety,1379376000,6,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

3.0,True,"04 20, 2012",AHNT97DWEAQUY,B001RERN30,Amazon Customer,"Indiana Jones swings onto the Wii with his trusty whip and a bunch of motion controls.  The latest adventure of everyone's favorite fedora sporting archeologist takes him on a quest for the Staff of Moses as he races against his rival Magnus Voller and the band of Nazis intent on getting the artifact for their own vile superior race driven agenda.  Just right off the bat I have to say that I think the game is fun.  Does it have problems?  Yes, it kind of does.  Some of the things people don't like about the game really don't bother me, but I do think there is good and bad to it.

Let's look at what most everyone considers bad first off.  The motion controls.  This game relies HEAVILY on motion controls.  Whether you're slinging Indy's iconic whip or using his fist to knock the teeth out of a Nazi, you'll be putting your body into it.  This aspect, I really didn't have a problem with.  I like the feel of wielding the whip.  Of feeling like I'm in a fist fight pummeling a Nazi within an inch of his life.  If you don't mind that kind of thing, the game probably won't bother you as much as it does some people.  However, the sensitivity of the motion can sometimes be a problem.  Especially in the fist fights.  You swing the Wii remote, Indy doesn't swing.  BAM, a cheap shot to the face by a lucky Nazi.  That gets annoying.  Especially when you have a room full of brawlers coming at you.  The cool thing is, you can use your whip to pull these guys to you and head butt them into submission and it feels great.  The bad news is, sometimes you pick up a shovel, take a swing and the game doesn't read your motion and suddenly you have a bunch of dudes the size of the Airplane Bruiser from Raiders of the Lost Ark dogpiling you out of commission.  All in all, though, I can forgive the game for that, because when it does work, it does feel rather satisfying.

The negative thing that drives me the most crazy is unskippable tutorials.  Yes, these things will make you want to brain yourself with the nearest convenient concrete block. Say Indy gives you a run down on how to use your gun to take out bad guys who are hiding in a balcony.  You take them out, walk off and a Cheap Death awaits with a bad step off a ledge or something of the sort.  That's right, Indy gets to take another five or so minutes to show you how to take out balcony hiding bad guys with your sidearm once again with no way to skip through it.  Uggh.

One other thing that might rankle is the running length of the game.  It's pretty short.  Less than ten hours, probably take you about 6 or so if you're not trying to get everything.  This is okay with me as I only get to do my gaming in 20 minute spurts most of the time and with a good amount of checkpoints to save your progress, it can stretch the game out over a good couple of weeks or more for me.  Then again, those who have hours to spare at a time will zoom right through this without breaking too much of a sweat.

That aside, I do think the game is fun.  It feels like you're controlling Indy through a decent Indiana Jones movie.  The locations feel like something you'd find in the movies and there's a decent variety to them.  You start off in the Sudan and find yourself going through places like ruins in the jungle, the streets of San Francisco, a wrecked ship found underground, and the icy tundra of Nepal.  You'll find a lot of brawling and a bit of puzzle solving along the way.  Nothing that'll make your brain explode, but still fun to figure out and satisfying when you see the results.  Once again, it's a decent job of making you feel like a participant in a Jones flick.

You can find a lot of ""artifacts"" hidden along the way and get enough of them, you can unlock movie trailers for the Indy series or new skins for the character to wear.  There are a few cool moves you can do (such as killing a certain amount of bad guys by knocking a shelf on them) and unlock Glory Moves, which unlock other things.  Most noticeably, the classic Point and Click adventure The Fate of Atlantis.  In a way, you're getting two games for one in that regard.

Another thing about the game I found enjoyable is that amongst a lot of the levels, we find some arcade type action.  A lot of time, you'll have the gun and you'll be a part of an on-rails shooter where you have to figure out the best way to dispatch bad guys.  You'll find yourself on a runaway trolley shooting at car after car trying to gun you down.  There's a pretty cool plane sequence where you have to navigate your way through a canyon-like area and take out enemy planes as you do it while holding the Wiimote like a joystick.  This was frustrating to me at first, but once I got the hang of it, I found it quite fun.  Also some water rafting and things of that nature.  I found it a nice little way to break up the traditional bad guy fighting, puzzle solving play of the rest of the game.

I'd want to give this game four stars for how fun it is as an Indy game, but the buggy controls have to knock it down a notch. For those who love them some Indiana Jones (what sane person doesn't), I think you can find this game cheap enough nowadays to warrant a buy.  I don't feel it's good enough to justify paying the full price when it came out, but after the price drop; sure.  If not a fan of the whip master, a rent would suffice.  You just have to know going in how much you can tolerate the heavy use of motion controls and if that's worth trudging through.  For me, it was.

3.0,False,"05 28, 2012",A2TSJBGOQ8IUG8,B00178630A,Michael,"I'll start off by saying that I was a fan of Diablo and Diablo II.  I bought Diablo via digital download and I beat the game on Normal mode and have began Nightmare mode.  There has been much controvery regarding the ""always-on"" DRM, the RMAH (Real Money Auction House) and the server issues at launch, which I will touch on during this review although I will keep my review focused on how the implimentation of these features affect the player experience and keep my opinions about DRM and Blizzard's potential agenda with the RMAH to myself in order to be as objective as possible.

I'll start with reviewing the gameplay itself.  If you liked Diablo II you will like Diablo III.  The gameplay is very similar although changes have been made to the skills/abilities system.  Many people have expressed their dislike of the new skills system but I liked it.  It was simple and kept the focus of the game on the hack/slash and not on skill micromanagement. On normal, the game takes about 8hrs for a full clear.  After this you can play the game over again on Nightmare, Hell and Inferno (which I hear is extremely difficult).  By playing on the more difficult levels you can continue to level your character to LvL 60 (you can beat the game on easy between LvL 25-30), get legendary drops and crafting mats not available in normal mode and unlock new abilities.  That being said there aren't any new bosses or story elements so you're essentially grinding through the same content but you do get new achievements in addition to the previously mentioned perks.  I enjoyed playing through the game and I will likely casually continue to play but I did not find the gameplay complelling enough to jump right back on and start playing through it again after my first clear.  I felt that the game was very...simple.  There just isn't much to it other than Diablo II with better graphics.  There isn't much in terms of innovation here, which is fine, it's fairly faithful to it's predecessors but I'll admit that I expected more. The environments aren't very interactive other than being able to destroy a few repetitive barrels, trees and a few other elements.  The voice acting isn't anything special and the inter-party dialogue is repetitive and stale.  The story isn't anything special but this isn't really an RPG so it's unfair to expect a really compelling storyline with fleshed out characters.  Overall, for me the game is very average and a bit of a letdown after 10+ years and all the hype.  I feel $60 is too much, $40 would be fair and $20 would be a steal.  Of note, the cinematics are AMAZING. This game has some of the most realistic and impressive cinematics that I've ever seen in a game.  The demons look so terrifying and creative and when you finally see them in the game it's kind of disappointing since the game's graphics are a bit behind the times. If I had to break it down into categories I'd say:

Graphics: 2.5/5 (They aren't ugly but they aren't really anything special. They look dated.)
Cinematics: 5/5 (AMAZING! You've got to see them to believe them!)
Sound: 3.5/5 (Very good soundtrack but I liked Diablo II's better; some of the voice-acting is B-movie quality (Tyriel,Leah and the demons were pretty solid though), except the cinematics which are very professional)
Replay: 4/5 (A new 'hardcore' boss or a hidden cinematic, new enemies, etc would have been nice, but there's still a lot to explore so the game is worth a repeat run on Nightmare/Hell/Inferno modes)
Fun: 3/5 (I enjoyed playing it for the 8-10hrs that I played but the gameplay isn't anything special)

The gameplay is a strong 3.5 or a weak 4/5 considering gameplay elements alone.

Now for the bad.  The ""always on"" DRM, the RMAH and the server issues.  The lack of an off-line mode is disappointing for those without a reliable internet connection.  Military members will be unable to take Diablo III on deployments or to training and as will anyone who needs to cut their high-speed internet due to hard financial times or anyone who is moving,etc.  It is extremely inconvenient regardless of the intent behind it.  Having to be always online and verified on Battle.net has lead to a slew of errors and issues that you can Google for all the details.  I have to be connected to main chat in order to not get disconnected (Error 3007) and chat is so full of gold spammers you can barely even see what people are writing.  Imagine World of Warcraft trade channel but 100x worse.  There is a solicitation about every 20-30 seconds. In short, in order to play single player, I need to be on a high-speed internet connection and connected to a server chat channel.  The RMAH is not yet implimented and continues to be delayed so I cannot comment on this other than this advertised feature does not exist as of this time.  The gold AH seems to be offline everyday for one reason or another and although I haven't used it, many people in general chat claim that they have bought/sold items and not recieved either the item or their gold.  Overall, the online experiences is very poor and the 'online-only' overcomplicates what should be a simple gaming experience.

I give the overall gaming experience, not considering the gameplay itself (reviewed above) a 2/5.

Gameplay elements = 4/5,  Gaming experience = 2/5 so I rated the overall game 3/5.  If I could do it again, I'd wait until the game goes down in price and Blizzard addresses some of the server/technical issues.

Western RPGs were born with the idea of roleplaying a character you design and making choices through that character that effect the story and game world.  Since Baldur's Gate Bioware have been inching ever closer to removing this freedom and choice in order to make prettier movies.  Dragon Age 2 is the worst offender yet, offering you very little (if any) real choice and creating your character for you, making the RPG elements of this RPG limited to things like stats and inventory, which even shooters have now-a-days.

You play Hawke and your only real control over Hawke's personality is whether he/she is mean, nice or joking.  You seriously have no other control over who Hawke is what-so-ever.  Hawke is either a rogue mage or a sibling to a rogue mage, and therefore you must play as a mage sympathizer for most of them game.  Hawke is a human, a refugee, and not long after you start a Kirkwall noble... nothing much can be done to shape or control Hawke's story or personality.  In the first Dragon Age you could create whatever kind of character you wanted and shape who they were over the course of the game.  That is roleplaying, not stats or inventory.  Dragon Age 2 has none of that.  Even the very few actual choices the game offers have very little effect on the narrative.  The most laughable example is the ending, which plays out EXACTLY the same no matter what factions you tried to support or sympathize with the entire game.  All that changes in this game is brief bits of dialogue... NOTHING else.  You're basically watching a movie between combat sequences, the same as a JRPG.

So, the combat then...  I actually like the combat in Dragon Age 2 on a fundamental level.  It's roughly identical to Origins' combat, just with a faster pace and a larger emphasis on flashy powers.  There is a lot of fun to be had in playing a rogue and toppling entire crowds with the ""rush"" ability, or electrifying entire crowds of people with lightning and fire.  It feels genuinely awesome to knock a ton of enemies over and to run through their flailing bodies, eliminating stragglers.  The problems with combat are mainly the endless waves of enemies that appear mid-fight and the lack of better camera control.  The waves are annoying because they come with every fight and make it impossible to plan strategically.  Want to set your party up?  Evaluate the scene?  Place your companions?  Too bad, because every fight will randomly change halfway through and none of that will matter.  On the camera front you can't zoom out like you could in Origins, making AoE spell placement much harder and in general just offering less tactical options.

Presentation wise Dragon Age 2 is typically impressive from Bioware, but does have some faults.  I personally love the new art style and I hope they keep it for future (better?) games in this series.  It looks unique and vibrant, compared to the muddy Tolkein cliche that Origins was.  There is nowhere near enough environments though, as you walk the same three city sections and the same four or five dungeons for the entire 50 hour game.  It gets repetitive after 20 hours, let alone 50, and it just smacks you in the face with how lazy and rushed it is.  Comparing Dragon Age 2 to Dragon Age: Origins in a value sense is almost laughable.  Dragon Age 2 feels like a budget release compared (and amusingly was $10 more at release than Origins).  On the plus side the PC version works great with a well-designed UI and control system.  The game looks really good in DirectX 11 with the high-res texture pack add-on (available on Bioware's website).  The redesigned skill-trees work very well too.

Other complaints include the use of online activation DRM, which is pointless customer bashing.  The game will still be pirated, the DRM does not stop that, it is simply used as a method to prevent resale.  Companions cannot use any armor other than what they come with, which severely limits inventory options.  Bioware developers have said in interviews that this was because they wanted to make companions look unique, which is clearly a case of preferring presentation over gameplay which makes no sense what-so-ever.

All these complains aside I still enjoyed the game for what it was.  The combat is fun in an action-game kind of way.  The story, while more of a movie than a game, is still enjoyable to watch.  The flaws, rushed and limited content and lack of actual roleplaying are really unforgivable though.  At the end of the day it's a 2-star RPG and a 3-star game, so I guess I will give it three stars overall.  It's so frustrating to watch these RPG companies that have been around for years and years turning away from true roleplaying to make movies though.  If you read Bioware developer comments on their forums or in interviews you hear them talking about how cinematic they want their games to be and how important presentation and story is over gameplay.  It's the exact opposite direction RPG developers should be going in if you ask me, and sad to see.",Bioware Continue To Make Movies More Than RPGs,1302652800,12,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC/Mac'}",

That said, it still has to install 9GB to your hard drive (sorry, Xbox 360 Arcade owners), the graphics are 7 years behind trend even for downgraded graphics, and the gameplay is tepid compared to its ambitious concept.

Like many gamers, I was lured by the ongoing dev saga of Watchdogs, from its announcement, across E3 demos, and finally a launch.  What a disappointment.  Everything Ubisoft set out to do was either stripped from the game or is poorly executed.  For example, the saving system, which has been a no-brainer for developers for 20 years, is all the sudden a white-hot mess in Watchdogs.  Ditto for checkpoints.  Meanwhile, the open-world concept that was supposed to shame GTA is itself small and messy.  While the game doesn't directly railroad your gameplay, it most certainly punishes you swiftly and severely for not following the script.

- Most cars still don't have interiors made (cockpit view)
- The Arcade car selection is really poor and you have to wait long into the game to drive the cool cars
- The awesome guitar riffs at the end of a race are gone

It's cool because:

- There is a good guitar riff at the beginning of a race
- There are many more cool cars with interiors made (cockpit view)
- The menus have a faster laid out
- You can access to the menu settings easier than before
- There are many more road tracks, and that's always awesome because GT always knows how to make good road tracks
- The cars turn better at curves, they just do, and it is very noticeable, which I think is the whole suspension thing they were talking about
- The steering wheel (Logitech G27) feels more realistic when you back up
- So far it looks like they got rid of the B-Spec, which is great in terms of game completion because no one cared for that, and not doing it made you feel like you didn't finished the game

Other things:

- You can still put your own music, which is important, but you have to restart the race in order to listen to your music, otherwise you are stuck with the game's soundtrack for the rest of the race, which is never bad, but I really don't care much for it having my own stuff to play
- The menu's in game music is still good, so I always leave that one up

3.0,False,"01 9, 2014",AROWZGGO4VTJU,B000W5Y49G,Cosmic Soujourner,"The Wii Zapper received much hoopla when it first came out and then fizzled out after people actually got their hands on it. I purchased this well after all the hoopla had gone out. I think that this Wii peripheral can enhance your gaming experience if you go into it with not too many expectation.
One of the problems, which others here have already mentioned, is that the trigger does not have any spring support. As a result, the trigger can sometimes get stuck. When I first started using the Zapper I found myself frustrated because the trigger would not return to position resulting in me fumbling with it until it got back into position. The result is that I missed quite a few shots. The solution to this is to slow down your shooting and to get into a rhythm in which you time your shots. The trigger cannot simulate rapid fire weapons such as those in Call of Duty. Also, if you find the trigger not responding well despite the slower shooting, try removing the Wii remote and re-seating it in the barrel.
Another problem which I found while using this Zapper is that the cross-hairs tend to fly around the screen. It is not steady and tends to move up, down, left or right and float on you. If you go into it not expecting a steady cross-hair, you might be okay with this. Some will find this frustrating and want to go back to the game pad immediately. But if you practice, you may get better at it.
Another thing I experienced while using the Zapper is that due to the design or ergonomics, my upper arms began to feel fatigued pretty fast. I lift weights and work out so I can only imagine what a person who does not work out must experience after a short time with using this peripheral. You can rest your arm on an arm rest and that may help. But be prepared for Zapper fatigue.
Some complained that assembling the Zapper is quite tiresome. I found it to be not too bad. You have to unlatch the holder on the butt of the weapon and remove the cover on the bottom in order to install the Wii nunchuk. That is the extent of the hassle. Installing the Wii remote itself is very easy. You just snap it on while holding down the button on Zapper. I don't think that the parts will break on the Zapper if you simply do what you are supposed to.  The plastic material on the Zapper is actually decent. It is not exactly cheap plastic material. It lies somewhere between cheap plastic and quality heavy duty plastic.
I have the Sony Move Rifle and I can compare it with the Zapper. I can say that the Move has a much better trigger due to a spring-like mechanism. Also, the cross-hair does not float like with the Zapper. But then the floating is not to be blamed on the Zapper itself but on the Wii hardware and software.
For those of you thinking about getting this device, be prepared to find out that the relatively few games that support it are few. And be ready to spend extra as the games are even harder to find. You see, game developers did not get into this device. The only ones available for this device are rail shooters such as Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles, House of the Dead and a few obscure titles. You can count them on your fingers of both hands. Not many. And if you are thinking of using it on first person shooters that are not listed as compatible titles, you will find out the hard way that the controls do not lend themselves well for such titles due to the fact that the controls will be at the top of the gun barrel away from your trigger finger.
If you are planning to get the games mentioned above, you may want to invest in the Zapper as it does give you the feel of aiming a gun at your target. Nothing can compare to using a barrel to simulate a shooting experience.
As for why the company decided to put the trigger on the front can be easily surmised by looking at the limitations of the Wii remote itself. If they had placed it towards the rear, there would be no room for the Wii nunchuk. Place towards the rear and the nunchuk would have to be at the front. Personally I would have designed the Zapper much differently. It would have moved the trigger more to the rear and still incorporate the nunchuk for its analog stick. If Nintendo would like to know how it can be accomplished, they can contact me and I would be willing to help them develop the peripheral for their current and future consoles.
If you are not planning to get the games I mentioned, you don't need this peripheral at all.
Pros:
1. Makes it feel like you are shooting with a gun.
2. Makes aiming a little easier.
Cons:
1. Trigger sticking.
2. Hassle assembling.
3. Floating cross-hair (due to Wii hardware and software)
4. Arm fatigue.
5. Extremely few games support it.",Not Bad But Not Great Either,1389225600,,,

The players move well, the control in passing and shooting is fairly precise, and the computer opponent AI is better than it was. But, even after just a couple weeks of playing it, several problems present themselves on a regular basis. Which is a bummer, because you'd think for $60 you would have to do a lot of deep gameplay to uncover something problematic. Not so. First, the freezing. I'm trying to detect a pattern or what triggers it. Not sure yet. But suddenly the camera will move off of the action and the whole game freezes. Restart. In Be A Pro mode, playing as a user-created defenseman, some line changes (toward the end of the period, seemingly) trigger a Keystone Cops-like glitch that makes your guy jump onto the bench while his replacement jumps onto the ice. And then they repeat. And repeat. And repeat. The only way they stop is if there's a stoppage in play. So you can go a large chunk of a period essentially short-handed. Sometimes, when the line change works, your player will reappear on-ice--but you can't control him. The CPU takes over for you until the next stoppage. I find it a little shocking that EA would ship this game as it is. I am by no means a hardcore gamer, but if I can unearth these by playing just an hour or two each night, who knows what's lurking deeper in the game? Come on EA, fix these (and other) issues.

Well not exactly, it has 2 major flaws which are connected. It's the picture quality and that only rf cables can be used. While playing the games you will notice vertical lines across the screen and the overall picture quality is quite snowy and it's not just because of the rf. Apparently this was a major design flaw for all Nes top loaders released in the U.S. (Japan's av famicom was available only with av and did not have this issue.) Despite all this I'm actually still glad I own one and will definitely keep it because I am a collector it is cool to pull it out every once in a while and look at or show it to people who didn't even know about it. It is quite unique looking, but I rarely actually play it. I prefer playing the original model by far because of this one's technical problems. However I will say unlike all the cheap knockoffs even though they don't have a bad picture quality they are poorly made and this is much more durable (its still the actual hardware no emulation here right sound no distortion like those) just in a smaller size and plays all nes games unlike those, so this thing will last and those will not it just suffers from having bad picture quality which of course is a big deal.

One of the best traits of half-life is that although it has much the same gameplay as any other shooter, it  seems to have done it exceptionally well.  Like most shooters you walk, run, climb, jump, crawl, and shoot, of course, but in Half-life it's so utterly engaging.  I'm not sure why, but I believe the great gameplay is a result of the intuitive nature of the puzzles and combat.  You can look around and say: ""Ah ha!  That's the way.""  And in most cases you are right giving you a satisfying feeling of knowing that you used your brain well.  However, as another reviewer noted, in some cases you get nailed with a ""gotcha,"" you die, and it's time to gawk at the ol' loading screen.  Nevertheless, it's not that hard after you play the game for a while, and who doesn't want a challenge?
The weapons are average and include the standard machine gun, shotgun, and pistols along with grenades and other weapons you pick up along the way.  You can also use guns set on turrets.  All your weapons pack a punch, and you shouldn't be dissatisfied with any of them.
Enemies include monsters and ""grunts.""  They're decent looking, and the grunts have good AI.  Some of the ""boss"" monsters need to be killed with special weapons that you fire from pressing a button on a wall.  It's very satisfying to see one of the big monsters finally go down.
The sound is exceptional except for the voices of the NPCs.  I'm not sure why their voices are distorted.  It might be a bug.
Speaking of bugs, this edition of Half-life has a bug that causes you to stick to some of the lifts which can be very annoying.  Sierra should have fixed this bug by now.  I used cheat codes to get around this problem, however.
As for cheat codes, use them!  As difficult as this game can be, you can finish it using these codes, but try the game without them at first, of course.
What really drags this game down is the graphics.  Although they aren't poor, they aren't that great either.  In some of the levels the design is so plain and smooth I feel like I'm in a tin can.  This problem gets in the way of Half-Life being a truly great game.

I actually think the cars handle far worse than the last game. The first GRID had handling that just seemed to work well, but here, I am running into more issues with keeping cars in a controlled drift. I am not sure why so many companies have trouble with this aspect. One of the few games that had driving down a science was Bizarre. Project Gotham Racing had arcade driving with drifting, YEARS AGO, and it worked perfectly. Even Forza, as great as the driving is, has terrible drifting. GRID seems to want to focus on drifting, but added in obnoxious arcade physics.

My biggest complaints regarding the physics have to do with AI and invisible walls:
-AI taps you and knocks you into a wall with the slightest hit. Meanwhile, if you bump into THEM, where it would normally send them out of control, or at least moving out of your way, you still somehow end up nose first in the wall. You hit their back bumper and you become stuck to their car. You try to bump along the side of the car and you end up getting stuck to their car and driving straight off the course.
-If you go off the road and graze the wall, you end up getting spun out and crashing. I end up having to use multiple rewinds just because I hit large patches or glue or something that makes they car spin 90-degrees and lose all forward momentum.
-Times are made up. I was flying on one track to the point where nobody was behind me. When I checked the mirror on the long straight, nobody was in my view. When the race was over, it said I only won by 100FT. I'm assuming AI times and scores are made up when you finish and are not based on where they are actually positioned on the track when you finish. Just annoying when you destroy someone and it says they were right on your heels.

Aside from all of that, the racing is pretty fun. I recommend not doing real damage on account of what I mentioned above. The damage is pretty good. Bumpers drag for a bit before falling off. Same with other body parts. The flow of the game is choppy compared to the first, but there is a decent progression. Car selection is decent, though half the cars in the game are pretty lame.

3.0,False,"11 21, 2008",AAS1SX0RL3K6I,B0017ZIIK6,Keith Hagel,"So I'm a massive DC comics fan, but never have been a big fan of Mortal Kombat.  I was still a fairly young kid when the games first came out in the arcade and on the SNES/Genesis, so the parentals tried to make sure that I didn't really get exposed to it.  I still knew of it and played it at my friend's houses.  It was generally fun, and Sub-Zero and Scorpion were awesome, but I never really got the hang of it or considered it much fun.  Of course, if you remember the Justice League: Task Force game for SNES, it was basically just a MK clone with DC characters.  And I LOVED that game, so maybe it was just a matter of having the game.

Fast Forward 10 years or however many it's been, Mortal Kombat versus DC Universe is out, and I'm skeptical.  For one thing, it's DC characters.  Truth, Justice and the American Way versus ""Finish Him, Brutality,"" and spines being ripped out. Riiiiight.  But based on a review from IGN's Greg Miller, I gave it a rental.

It's honestly not bad.

I'll be honest, I have not played a Mortal Kombat game since the 3rd one, and had never payed attention to the story.  So the bad taste that the 3D ones have left for everyone was non-existant for me.  But as far as fighting games go it's pretty solid.  The controls are pretty standard.  Up for Jump, down to duck, face buttons to attack, and shoulder to block, as well as the analog stick for 3d movement (I didn't use this much, but the mechanic works well enough unless you're a fan of projectile attacks).  The Free-Fall combat, sorry Kombat, works alright, and the test your might mini games are fun.  But the real deal for me was the close Kombat mechanic.  It's awesome seeing the in depth brutal moves, especially when their uniforms rip and tear (Scorpion's mask falls off, awesome).  Hardcore fighting fans will get a kick out of the character specific challenges that require precise timing to pull off expert moves.  I personally couldn't do a single one, but seeing some of them against people online really knocked my socks off.

A Side note: If you own both consoles, I'd really recommend the PS3 version.  Not for any reason other than the 360 d-pad really isn't well suited for this game (or really any game that uses the d-pad).  After playing on both consoles most of the people I know prefer the PS3 one for this reason only.  But it's really a matter of choice for you.

The storyline isn't anything to write home about, but it's MK vs DCU, what are you expecting?  They did get some of the talent from DC to try to assemble a story so it's not horrible.  The characters generally act like you'd expect them to (although I can't see any set of circumstances that would make Batman and the Joker allies).  And the online component is there.  Trophies also make an appearance if you're into that sort of thing, and they're generally fairly easy to get.

So is MK vs. DC a great game?  No, it's not more than a rental right now.  But it's a fun rental, and as soon as it comes down in price I'd definetely recommend it as a budget beat-em-up for you and your friends.  If nothing else, you can just play as your preffered side and either have an interesting 3d remake of the older MK characters, or a DC fighting game.  Not bad considering how horrible it could have been.

First off this game is not anything new to the COD franchise. For the most part you can think of it as a MW2 expansion.

What's different? Well I believe Infinity Ward, and Sledgehammer Games took all the negative feedback from both MW2, and Black OPS, and tried to ""fix"" them in this game.

~Changes
- Quickscoping returns (sniper favorite)
- Grenade Launchers, and Rocket Launchers are SEVERELY reduced in damage from MW2
- No end game killsteaks ""nuke""
- Smaller ""less open"" Maps
- No Stopping Power - Lightweight - or Danger Close (no more running around super fast knifing everyone)
- More Balanced killsteaks (yet they still messed up read further)
- Added in ""Survival Mode"" like Black Ops Zombies but much less enjoyable.
- New Killsteaks split into Assault, Support, and Specialist)
- Gun level up feature
- theater mode (like black ops)

~POSITIVES
-fast, fluid 60FPS Gameplay
-Snipers are perfected (if you liked sniping in any cod, you'll like this game)
-Instant matchmaking, and fairly good connections. (not much lag)
-Some of the killsteaks are very fun (juggernaunt, osprey gunners, reapers, assault drones)
-Survival Mode is fun for a while, and enjoyable with a friend
-Cheaters/Boosters are being dealt with, so no more boosting lobbys.

~Negatives
-Not very much ""new content"" you'll feel like you are playing MW2 all over again
-Campaign feels exactly the same as Modern Warfare 2. I've played a few levels, and was bored.
-Unbalanced weapons (some weapons and classes are overpowered compared to other weapons, Type 95, PP90M1, Striker)
-Feels like MW2 and Black Ops, so it lacks replayability if you've already played previous cods.

and what I dislike the most ->
-Support Killstreaks was a HORRIBLE idea, your killsteak doesn't reset when you die so even the worst players will be calling in uav's, and stealth bombers every game killing you over, and over, and over...

~FUN
This is where it'll vary from player to player. If you are GOOD at COD you will definitely enjoy this game more than someone who isn't very good. If you are not good at first person shooters, you will likely hate this game.

Also, keep in mind this game is almost an exact copy of MW2 with parts of Black OPS included, if you liked those games, you'll likely end up enjoying this one as well.

~Pro Tip (for anyone seeking an early advantage)
Use Hardline PRO (killsteaks require 1 less death, and every 2 assists = kill)
Then use assault strike package - UAV, Care Package, Predator Missile
You will be gettting a killsteak every 2 kills, 3 kills, 4 kills, and then it will repeat at 6kills, 7 kills, 8 kills, and so on. Easiest way to keep a UAV up on your team at all times.

~Final Review
MW3 isn't much different from MW2. If you still think MW2 is fun, then this game is for you. If you lost interest, or you are a bit tired of MW2, or Black OPS, or just not good at shooters, then stay away from MW3. it's not anything different, more of an expansion pack than anything.

If you liked the original Halo then you'll more than likely like Halo 3...and you probably like or will like Halo 2 for that matter.

To be honest it is the only trilogy that keeps as true to its origins as the original as I've ever seen.  Graphics are...meh...compared to other games for the 360...even with HDMI I was disappointed.

Halo was the sweetest thing since sliced bread and I do cheer for the Master Chief.  Seriously, what's not to love about the guy?  He's tough, gruff, kicks butt, and is basically invinceable.

It's basically Halo with a few different guns, the same maps with trees and rocks in different places, and a few differently placed bad guys.  The addition of equipment is interesting.  All in all this is an average game.

But how do you make a library of hundreds of PC games into suitable fare for the couch? A mouse and keyboard with a lapdesk, obviously. No? Fine, you can try to use this thing, instead. Yes, this is Valve's ""play anything"" controller, covering everything from Civilization to Call of Duty. And, at least in theory, it works. The problem is, in my opinion, this is mostly a compromise.

The way it works is that it uses twin touchpads in conjunction with several buttons and an analog stick. The right touchpad typically emulates a mouse and the left touchpad typically serves as a mouse wheel. The triggers usually represent mouse clicks. However, you can change that, as the Steam Controller allows you to customize your controller settings to suit your whims, and if you can't decide on a profile, you can instead download another user's. The touch sensors also have haptic feedback which represent a trackball and mouse wheel, but I found that these sensors were actually superior to trackballs. With a real trackball, I constantly feel like I have to concentrate to keep the thing from getting away from me, but that's not a problem with the Steam Controller. It's ironic that the imitation beats the real thing. However, the mouse wheel function leaves something to be desired, being unreliable in which way it scrolls. I've also seen some criticisms of the controller saying that it feels cheap, but I think what they really mean is that it doesn't feel heavy, which is not really a good indicator of quality in this case, you know?

So how does it work in practice? Well... eh... it's a bit mixed. I tried playing Metal Gear Solid V with it and found it too clumsy to use. Starting one mission, I threw myself onto a jeep and roared off to an objective, but found that using the right touchpad was just not up to the task of turning the camera around fast enough. I soon switched back to a normal controller. Then I tried XCom with it, and was pleasantly surprised to see that the mouse emulation features actually work quite well, and the game was playable, even fun with this controller. The only problem was that the custom profile I downloaded for it wasn't working. Why? Was it because I was playing offline? Was it because I was using a mod? Either way, I was not very pleased with the result.

I don't necessarily regret getting this controller. It's certainly very interesting to use and a great idea, I just wonder if it could have done better with a different configuration. Maybe two analog sticks instead of one. That way, action games might have been more viable. As it stands, though, if a mouse and keyboard is too clumsy for your living room, you should probably consider taking a look at this controller.

Update: Another flaw spotted. Rechargeable batteries are INCREDIBLY hard to put in or out of this controller. Come on, Valve, did you really think everyone was just going to use alkaline batteries?

Update 2: It seems that a recent update fixed the issue I was having with not loading my profiles with XCom. However, now that I'm playing XCom 2, it won't load the correct profile I want. I want to say it's the profile I selected, but that's just it. This may sound incredible to you, but Steam's software does not allow you to explicitly select a profile for your controller. How does it work, then? You basically export a new profile for your controller, then hope the controller actually uses that profile and continues to do so every time you start the game. Valve, seriously! Have a button that says ""Use this profile"" and make it work, for crying out loud!

While it is kind of interesting experiencing a history you weren't around for (or even your parents), it was never really something that I paid a large amount of attention to, preferring to play things such as RPG's or Zelda. Well since the stores didn't exactly have anything interesting, I thought ""why not?"" so I picked it up and while I don't regret trying it out, there's almost an air of ""wasn't this supposed to be really awesome?""

Story: Not really a story per se, you're a soldier during World War II doing various missions after the Invasion of Normandy. To be honest I wasn't even following the story much since it was mainly ""we gotta go here and take care of this and defeat that"" and off I went.

Graphics: Coming out on XBox360 and then on PS3 and the Wii, the graphical qualities look nice enough but then you see the next-gen ones and you feel like these look tame but ultimately level designs have enough detail and there's enough lighting and textures to make the levels feel alive. Only thing is that your zoom for your guns almost cover your enemy so distant sniping makes it a pain since you can't tell if you're gonna hit him or not and whether you should re-adjust for the recoil.

Sound/Music: It's big, loud, epic, and surprisingly forgettable. Yeah it sounds Hollywood-caliber music but ultimately you won't find yourself humming along to this stuff which is a shame since it sounds like you should. Voice-acting is alright, certainly better than most games out there but it would've been nice if I could hear it half the time without having to adjust my settings.

Gameplay: The biggie for any game any there are parts which this game does well but other times it's just ridiculous and even frustrating. You get your standard weaponry found during that period but like I said in the graphics, using the scope sometimes covers your enemy. Enemies at times don't react like they should. I pumped an enemy full of bullets in his gut yet he just reacted like you shot him with a paintball and he got up and started shooting again. Not to mention they have sharp aim which makes you wonder why we even won the war since they're such sharpshooters, not to mention it's hard to see them at times and figure out if they're yours.

As with any squad-based games, the big thing concerns their AI: namely do you have to do everything yourself or can they manage on their own for awhile? And they're actually quite good, ducking when they have to and advancing when they have the advantage. A couple times though I noticed they would fire smoke grenades instead of the normal ones making it near impossible to see who I'm shooting at (which doesn't help since apparently Nazis have smoke-proof eyeballs.) Is it a fun game? Well it certainly is intense at times but it also can get frustrating since you're shot at from every which direction and you always feel like spinning all over figuring out who's shooting you.

3.0,True,"05 15, 2016",AP3V0ZR3XLVQX,B00GODZYNA,Ton Yanzik,"There's something fundamentally off in Uncharted 4. The story is fine, and even good at some points. The characters are okay, and not significantly different from previous entries. The puzzles, platforming, and shooting all run smoothly with no noticed interference. But there's something wrong here, and I don't know what it is. It's like this game went through all the motions it needed to, but I still don't like it and can't exactly pinpoint the reason why. And because of that, this short review will focus on what I do know.

Having played the series from the beginning, I'm a long time fan of Uncharted. The first game was so good it could have been considered a console seller, the second took that and made it even better, and the third missed the ball a bit by being mostly a series of set pieces with new ideas and features that took more away than they added. After having played until the end credits, Uncharted 4, just like the others, is a pretty good game, but it lacks in many ways. The puzzles in this game feel bland and very simplistic compared to ones from previous entries. I do like how the eager handholding the third game introduced is more or less gone in this one, but only one or two puzzles were all that memorable or good here. The shooting is as good as any of the games, and both stealth and going loud are enhanced with new features like tall grass and enemies that constantly push further towards you. The AI itself is severely lacking, though, in that once you do go loud, every enemy on the map knows the exact spot you're in and getting back into stealth is nearly impossible. In all the decades Naughty Dog has been around, they seem to still be coding AI in a similar way they did since day one, making for every action scene being a massive shootout needing tactics no more complex than killing the enemy before they kill you. In a way, I like this simplicity, but it gets boring fast, and there's no reason why the AI should be this blunt and to the point. The platforming, while it works with few flaws, has a lot of control prompts for poorly introduced new features, like the grappling hook, and has constant breaks, where an ally is needed to progress further in an area. This only makes the overly cinematic feel of the game more apparent and makes any actual gameplay feel like a means to an end more than anything else. It's that cinematic story telling I think is the main difference and problem here. Not only does it contaminate the gameplay, but it's often drawn out and feels more like a TV drama popular with all the 20-somethings than a video game. It takes itself way too seriously, in a bad way, has far too much realism in both tone and character movements and dialogue, and leaves few likable characters, even diluting past favorites of mine like Sully who feels more like a babysitter this time than an actual character. The only likable and well-acted and fleshed out character here is Rafe Adler, while all the others feel hollow or oddly done.

The biggest problem I have with this game is that, while it claims to be the ending of Nathan Drake's story, it doesn't feel like it at all. Other flaws and preferences aside, the whole time, this game was confident and almost pushy in saying it's the last of the series, and only got louder in that near the end, but it never felt like it. The third game, from what I remember of it, felt like more of an actual end to Drake's story than this game did, and I didn't even think the story in that one was as good as the previous two entries. I think it mostly has to do with the ""Last of Us"" tone Sony seems so overly fond of and obsessed with since the late PS3 era. While fine for some games, it doesn't fit or work at all with the Uncharted series. Simply put, uncharted 4 isn't a bad game, but it's a disappointing one. For having few expectations after the disappointment of 3, 4 seems to have found new ways to disappoint me despite improving in several ways from that entry. And for being the last in the series, it picked the worst ways to disappoint it could have this time around. If you're a long time fan of the series like I am, having been interested since before the first game was even released, I'd recommend to wait for a price drop unless you really can't wait to play it. In a few years from now, it's the first and second games that I'll remember most, while only bits and pieces of this one will stand out.","The end of a thief, but I'm not sure which one",1463270400,13,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",

I especially like the fact that he's telling the story, and its funny to hear him go, ""no no, that isn't what happened..."".  Nonetheless, the story is addicting and you really feel like the prince.
The controls were hard to become accustomed to, but they ended up being great.  Since the combat is fairly unique (the sand people have only one weakness--dagger of time), it takes a while to learn your abilities, but they are very neat.  The gameplay IS SO LINEAR YOU COULD CHOKE.  This is by and large the most annoying failure of the game.  There is only way to go, and only one way to do it.

The dialogue was the worst, corniest I've ever heard in a video game, and I've been playing video games for decades. I really don't understand how the dialogue passed; it's so inexplicably silly and awkward. Dr. Hill is a certifiable low point, as the actor's accent tends to be all over the place (which I've noticed in films he's in), and his animation is off-putting. Seems the writers went the now-traditional (read: predictable) route of making most of, if not all, the characters, unlikable as possible.

The surround sound isn't as precise as I would like it to be, either, but it's passable.

The audio quality is irrelevant to me, because this headset is cripplingly uncomfortable. The foam band at the top of the head is to tough to provide any relief, and the same goes around the ears. Wearing these with glasses is asking for a headache. That, and after wearing these for an hour or so, my neck starts to throb with pain--if you've ever been in a bad enough car accident to get whiplash, then you'll know what I mean. Removing the headset immediately relieves the pressure.

I have had no issues with the mic quality--in fact I've had friends comment positively on the quality of the mic on PC. In comparison, they always complained about mic quality on my stupidly, stupidly overpriced Turtle Beach XP500s ($*#!ing wireless headsets) on PC.

One other nagging complaint: as far as I can tell, you cannot update the firmware on the headset--attempting to do so with the Logitech software indicates that you cannot.

Lo and behold, though, Namco Bandai decides to make it available for the Wii as a remake, and I jumped in for the new-classic journey at last.  My overall impression with ""Klonoa"" was this: what's the big deal?

Once upon a'whimsical dream world, a rabbit-dog-creature discovered a floating blob which the two later became friends.  Suddenly, some bleak ancient entity has been revived to bring vengeance on the world, so it's up those two to stop him from letting darkness consumed their home; it's simple stop-the-forces-of-evil 101 tale.  People say the light-hearted story has its share of heavy-handed events, and to their credit, the game does have some depressing moments, though they're at the same level as a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Disney-film/dp/B00003CXB4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Disney film</a>.  The story did have an interesting twist which ended on a bittersweet note, though it's only a downer if one hasn't seen ""E.T."" or ""Stand by Me"".  I guess I'm falling under comparisons in a disdain manner because I never felt attached to any of the characters; they all just play their roles and none of them really stand out.

Gameplay should be the main factor of fun anyways, and while I can understand a game should appeal to all ages, did the fun had to scale down to being elementary?  This game looks and feels like a kindergarten's platformer.  There's no challenge in any of the levels, I can easily move forward without avoiding enemies and I'd finish a level with some health to spare.  The bosses are total chumps; one with half-a-brain can find their weak spot and beat them in a matter of seconds.  Considering the game has so little levels, I figured there would be much to do besides moving right (or up since it's a 2.5d game), jumping and knocking down baddies, but that's the most the game provides; even though each level has hidden items to discover for replay value, they're very easy to locate.  To be fair, the later levels do provide some interesting puzzles to prevent the game from being tedious, but they don't ignore the feeling that ""Klonoa"" has no thrill to be immersing.  Ironically enough, there's a bonus level after completing the game which makes even the most experienced gamer throw their controllers at the screen; by that, I mean it's ber-hard.

At least the game is functional.  The controls work well enough (though the special move is absolutely useless), the soundtrack is pleasant to the ears, and I do admire the vibrant aesthetics.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cute-childish-games-can-be-fun/dp/B001C58T5U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cute, childish games can be fun</a>, and maybe ""Klonoa"" had some charm back in Playstation Uno, but after my time with ""Super Mario Galaxy"" and ""Ratchet & Clank"", this game doesn't have much to offer.

3.0,False,"07 28, 2004",A1KYZ36LVN6FZZ,B00002EPZ2,Nicolas Green,"What would happen if there was a place where there existed a portal to anywhere you wanted to go, both real and imaginary?  You would find yourself in Sigil, the city of doors, deep in the center of the multi-verse known as Planescape; a place where the mere belief in something will cause its existence.  You play the role of 'The Nameless One' an immortal being with a touch of amnesia, in his search to find out about himself.

Gameplay:

Torment utilizes the Infinity Engine made popular by Baldur's Gate, yet it seems to be geared more toward the new RPGer rather than fans of BG.  The interface is probably, the only downside to this game.  Everything is accessed through a circular right-click menu that is accessed during a paused game.  Everything from talking to your characters, changing weapons, casting a spell and using special abilities is run from this window.  It's a good idea in theory, yet it tries to do too much with too little.  The original quick buttons found in BG were a much more efficient set-up.

The game uses a slightly modified AD&D second generation rule-set.  As with the interface, the rule set has been simplified in this game.  You have no choice to your starting character.  Simply put, you are the nameless - an immortal human male, who starts as a fighter.  During the game, you have the option of changing between your starting class of a fighter and a thief or mage.  There's no dual-classing, switching to another class is like building a new character, yet switching back, you will find all your previously earned experience saved.  Your available party members are not only locked in whatever class you find them in, but are, for the most part, locked in their weapon and armor choices.

What makes this game one of the better RPGs on the market is the story.  In your quest to discover yourself, you learn about the story and concept of the planeworlds, an interesting universe where belief is very fabric of being.  Though it introduces the player to the world, the story is very linear and you'll find yourself without much choice in the matter besides your decision to play good or evil.

Graphics:

If you've played any of the Black Isle games on the Infinity Engine, you'll be very familiar with the sights and sounds of Torment.  It's a bit more zoomed in than the others, and that can lead to confusion when trying to cross long distances without the use of your mini-map.  But for being 5 years old and only 800x600 it is very artistically done.  A lot of work was put into creating a town that looks and feels like it could be the center of the universe.  Besides the obvious, the game has aged very well.

Sound:

The ambient music is excellently done, as well as the voice acting.  The biggest problem is in the game's EAX manipulation.  If you have this turned on, you'll be hard pressed to hear the voice-acting in any outdoor or cavernous scenes as it just blends into white-noise.  Besides that, the only annoyance comes with the apparent necessity to have your characters have a voice prompt after they do *anything*.  After you've heard one of your character announce they have stealthed for the umpteenth time, you'll be hoping to never hear it again.

Overall:

While it's a fun game, it's not quite my cup-of-tea.  Your character is immortal, you die and wake up somewhere with your inventory intact.  For the most part, you can go around with your level one thief and try to take out City Guards with no side effect.  The game is just too easy, even at the hardest settings.  Add that to the severely linear gameplay and at times it becomes a little slow.  It's your typical quest driven RPG without much in the way of side quests.  Luckily, you have a variable alignment which can change depending on your actions,  and that adds a little to the mix, but not enough.  If the story wasn't as well written, then this game would have been a flop, so pick this up as a nice interactive novel, but don't expect a second play through unless the best RPG you've played before this is FF.",This is a good introduction to AD&D,1090972800,16,,

Pros:

1.stunningly beautiful cinematics. I think you can find that only in the FF games. Not even in the best PC games, like Dragon Age Origins (which is a great game, but no match for FF cinematics or battles).

2.very good battles, MUCH better than the rubbish I experienced in FF XII ! Still, I would have preferred the older turn-based battle. But the use of materia is there, as well as some interesting new features, like Materia Fusion. So it's still good.

3. Likeable characters with some good sense of humour thrown in at times (which I think makes a game more appealing.). For example, in the 'slot machine' battle function, once I got 2 Cloud.  The third one looked really funny, it SLOWED down and appeared as if trying to push itself inside the slot. So I thought 'wow I am going to get 3 Cloud'. And then WHAM, the same Cloud face goes back and another unrelated one gets in the slot instead. Or when Zack is fighting with an umbrella beach.

4. you get to revisit old locations in FF VII

Cons:

1. the story is the usual strange nonsense stuff that Final Fantasy always seems to have pulled off. After 13 hours of gameplay, I totally lost the story and started yawning and thinking 'who cares'.

2. the music is not as good as FF VII, some themes seems to have been rearranged by the new composer.

3. there is no world map ! Unforgivable ! Roaming the world ,to me, was the best feature in FF VII and 8, along with the great music and battles.

4. it's not  a party-based game, you go solo the whole time. No friends. Boring.

It's a good game but overrated and I deleted all my saves after about 15 hours of gameplay. The story started to feel nauseating. To be fair, even FF 7 and 8 had nauseating, gloomy parts about monsters and leper or whatever ( FF7) and freaking Laguna in FF 8, which bored me out of my skull.

The battle system is great, but not for magic. By the time you get done healing yourself of all the random status ailments the enemies put on you, you won't have any MP left. Too many enemies cast status spells in this game and you're constantly having to cure yourself while you're getting hit. By then they're usually casting it on you again. So most the time in harder areas, you really won't have much MP to work with for attack spells if you want to heal your health. Secondly, most the time when you try to cast a spell like blind, poison, slow, ect. On an enemy, it will miss them, and attack spells are basically useless anyway, because why even use them if your regular attack is almost just as strong.

Often I did get frustrated at the amount of time it took me to get from one end of a battle to the other, only to get sniped from behind and start over. (run... run...run... run... run......... die...... repeat....) But adjusting your game play to take advantage of squads and vehicles, helps cut down on being shot from behind while you advance across the field.

It can often be difficult to ID friend or foe, as there will be a mess of HUD displays blocking your view of an enemy running at you.

I'm also not a huge fan of the load out process, but the addition of the Battlelog android app actually helps to sort through your load out ahead of time and figure out what you want to use.

Normally I prefer the fast paced, close quarters of COD, but luckily BF4 thought of this and set up a few different ""no vehicle"" close quarter maps and game modes. (i.e.: team death match, etc...)

The single player campaign is good... but the story is a typical shooter storyline. What I really miss is the humor and story behind the Battlefield: Bad Company games. (Those kept me engaged in the single player game longer before I ventured online.)

From a graphical standpoint, this really is beautiful game. The guns are detailed, and the environments are awesome. Being able to blow a hole in a wall to get to someone is cool, but sometimes I found walls that somehow are made of some indestructible substance.

Control wise it takes a lot of getting used to. While similar to most FPS controls, for some reason I find controlling vehicles far more difficult than they are in other games.

Overall this is should be in any true FPS collection. (A star is lost for the loss of Bad Company, and one for various multiplayer annoyances/load out/control issues.)","Good, but I miss the Bad Company!",1385769600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Part of this was learning how to set up magic and all the other controls, but once I figured most of the stuff I had fun with it anyway.  What I liked about this was that I think it allowed for both mouse and cursor movement (I think, but I played this awhile ago), which is good because I hate trying to click on a moving object.  I also liked how the game progressed, and even allowed for multiclassing.  The other thing that took so long was that I wanted to get every little treasure, and for the most part I managed it.

There was one thing that wasn't correct, though.  A friend and I sat down one time and wrote a character sheet, and it turned out that the druid learned one spell per day (plus perhaps one or two extra for his wisdom), but could use it up to three times per day at the start. NWN seemed to be designed backward in this respect, as it said spells per day was different spells that the druid possessed, but they were only useable one time per day. The sorceror seemed to have normal uses per day, but I believe they were just starting out, and this might account for it being normal rather than backwards as well. As we understood it, spells per day actually meant just that, the spells that were used per day, whereas this spells known meant sepearate spells known. While the spells known might plausibly have given up to 9 different spells, each with 4 uses (spells per day), though I doubt it, I really don't think it was designed to have four different spells, each with up to 9 individual uses. It seemed like it would make more sense to have it as a mana pool, especially since wizards have unlimited arcana, this would mean spells per day was actually 4 uses per day, with any spell, and in a mana pool once 4 spells were cast from that spell level it gets expended. Rather than 4 spells and unlimited uses, which is why I pretty sure it was backward.",Okay,1099440000,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

I recently got to Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, and it was equally a fun and frustrating experience. The game is gorgeous, the landscape and the sky were quite beautiful at times. Nathan Drake is a fun character with fun comrades and they generally make for a fun time while trudging through this game.
That is the main problem I had with this game however. I kind of felt like I was just beating my head against a concrete wall trying to get through. I was fighting the camera as well as a seemingly endless horde of rather incompetent enemies. I was dealing with aiming that was a bit off and jumping that at times was also off. The puzzles were odd, they weren't difficult but they were there. It seems like a lot of things were thrown in to pad the length of the game. Many cool moments were cut short or ruined by an odd camera angle or an enemy thrown in for the hell of it. The story line was alright, although it is incredibly obvious where it is going the whole time.

I played it the whole way through on Easy/Casual mode, and traded it in because I wasn't likely to play through it ever again, and it was still worth a hefty amount at my local game store.

Things I was less than impressed with:
1) most of your time is spent on an 8-bit style map/level moving your units around. This is viewable in 3D...why?
2) Even in easy/casual mode...it is impossible to level healers. They are immediately targeted by the enemy, and will be dead at the end of the enemies turn. So, you can either leave them behind entirely and rely on health potions, or you can grind Risen that you summon to low level zones and level them up to 10 to make them a hybrid class so they die slower. I had a similar problem with the Dancer, who is apparently a big deal if you can use her coherently...I never much managed that either, and she was always a 1 shot kill also.
3) all of the children kind of have the same story: ""hey mom/dad, no, you're definitely my mom/dad because I have your ring/dragon/sword"" and all parents are shocked and amazed that their spawn from the future have come back to save them from an untimely demise.
4) the love stories are lacking-essentially, if a girl will talk to you at all, you need to talk to her ~5 times and she will marry you.
5) the cut scenes are good, the fight scenes are pretty cool, but with one glaring difference from the animated ones-none of the characters have feet. I don't know how or why this happened...maybe so that they looked like their feet were lost in the deep grass, but even on stone floors, the characters lack feet--WHY DONT THEY HAVE FEET?!

All in all-with all the replay value the game claims...I had no specific interest in playing it again, making different marriage alliances, getting any of the DLC or increasing the difficulty. I probably got 40 hours out of it for my $40, so that's good enough for me.","maybe not for newcomers, no feet=no replay",1411689600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Wactor,"I spent  over 100 hours playing this game and all of its various side quests, and I only managed to complete a little more than half of the total missions.  This game also has a Hard setting so if you're into this game, you can easily get your money's worth by purchasing it and letting it siphon months of your free time.

However, I wouldn't recommend it; after completing the first hundred or so missions you begin to wonder to yourself just how many times you have to clean an airship, deliver correspondence, help with the spring festivals, and other menial tasks.  Don't get me wrong, it was awesome to be able to level-up by accomplishing such tasks.  It's also a nice break from always battling foes, but is it really worth the trouble?  Is it really worth trying to visit four different areas in six days, visiting different baby mamas while posing as your client?  Is it moral?

Most of the time it isn't; the dialogue is incredibly drab and after the tenth hour I always skimmed the words.  This is an unprecedented move for me, as I generally love the dialogue/storyline of Final Fantasy games.  It unnerved me that I just couldn't get into this game.

However bad the storyline may be the battle system more than makes up for it.  The classes, weapons, attacks, terrain, enemies, and laws are all incredible.  I played this game mainly for the battle system, not understanding most of the reasoning behind why I was killing this bunny, aiding this witch, picking up this flower, or intimidating this blob monster.  It had to be for the good of mankind right?  I believe I was fighting the forces of evil, but I don't really know.  People were paying me to do it, and as a mercenary you don't ask questions.

It's probably a good thing there was no morality gauge in this game.  Before I knew it the credits were rolling and I didn't have to contemplate as to my noble/horrendous deeds I committed or my impact on this world.  I knew that in the final stage someone was trying to kill me, so I killed them.

I remember walking into the local EB Games and asking for a copy.  It was so cool looking!  The instruction booklet had one of those awesome, shiny foil covers and to a 14 year old that was like a freaking siren's call.  The EB Games employee pulled it off the shelf and held it for a second . . . ""The cover art's pretty cool, isn't it?"" he asked distantly.  ""Oh man!"" I replied, barely containing my excitement, ""Yeah, it looks awesome!""  He looked up at me, still holding the game.  ""Don't buy it though . . . it's terrible.""  I was taken back by this comment.  Perhaps he only wanted the sweet, shiny covered goodness for himself.  ""Umm, nah, I still wanna buy it.""  I quickly replied.  ""No, seriously, it's awful . . . please don't waste your money on this.""

My father, who had accompanied me on this journey (being a responsible parent he was aware that the game was rated 'M'. had made sure it did not contain any content he would not approve of his 14 year old son partaking of, and had come into the EB Games with me as they still bothered to make sure that parents approved of underage purchases of 'M'-rated material back then) was starting to get frustrated for me as my young brain wasn't used to this sort of feedback from a retailer.  My father's assumption was that this fella behind the counter was probably a racing game fan or something like that.  This sort of game just wasn't his cup of tea so he was trying to tell everyone else it was crap so he could recommend something 'he' liked.  My father leaned in and told the young salesfellow, ""Look, the kid wants to buy the game, just let him buy the game.""

The young man shrugged, uttered a quick, ""Well, I did warn you."" and rang me up.  Filled with glee I made my purchase and beamed with joy the whole way home, eagerly anticipating popping my new purchase into my playstation and tearing through the minions of darkness as Spawn.  My father ranted most of the ride home about how rude that guy had been and who was he to tell someone what they will or won't enjoy.

If you liked it, you'll tell others and they'll buy it...If you didn't like it, you'll also tell others and unsold copies die on the shelves. Being relatively new to the PS3, my FPS benchmark is Half-Life 2. The game was compelling, challenging and it had finely-tuned controls. It was such a satisfying game experience that I was disappointed when the game finally ended. For me, Killzone 2 is almost the opposite. It is such a MADDENING game, that I would shove it down the throats of those who released it on the market if I ever met them!

It's a shame that so many people put so many man-hours into the development of this much-hyped game for it to come up short, primarily because of faulty controls...It's the ONE thing you'd think they'd get RIGHT on an FPS after years of development. Not so. In fact, SOMEONE NEEDS TO BE FIRED at Guerilla Games! I've never screamed so many 4-letter words at an inanimate object before in my life...But now my HDTV has skid marks on it from all of the expletives I've yelled at it during this half-baked game!  First, the GOOD:

1) This game has a good intro movie to clue everyone in who missed KZ1 (including me).

2) The voice acting is crisp and clear, although it's hard to say who was screaming more profanities per hour: me or the characters. Seriously...I'm an adult and I know this is a ""war"", but the frequency of profanities is so overdone you'll probably just MUTE the sound during cut scenes. On the lighter side, there's a bizarre mix of ""Earthling"" accents spoken by various characters...Including a Helghast informing Radec near the end of the game that ""Security identified a breach at the main gate"" with the thickest British accent you're likely to hear outside of Liverpool. The fact that you're supposed to be in an extrasolar location (Alpha Centauri system) has to elicit a chuckle.

3) Visually, it's a stunning game...But I can say that about pretty much every game we've played on our PS3 in the 3 months we've had it. Outstanding graphics are more of the NORM now and don't make a 5-star game all by itself.

I really do try to get into a game, but now for some things that make you go, ""Huh?""

1) The setting is ""hundreds of years in the future"", OK? So the bad guy steals ""a nuclear weapon"" and needs the launch codes to explode it...LOL. Are you kidding me?? It's hard enough believing that pistols, machine guns and grenades are still being used as primary weapons on the battlefield this far ahead...But the most sinister future weapon Guerilla can come up with is 20th century nuclear weapons technology? Furthermore, you have a major boss battle in a building that should've been completely leveled after one of these weapons is detonated. Again, LOL...

2) The chief military villain has the ability to ""teleport"" himself at will. Apparently, he's the only one with this technology. Did he discover it all by himself or wouldn't the scientists who developed it also be teleporting around? Wouldn't a mutinous underling kill him in his sleep to steal the mysterious cloaking ability and rule the world? And why isn't this man ruling the world now...I mean, he still WORKS FOR SOMEONE ELSE! You'll just shake your head and wonder HOW something like this even found its way into the game.

3) You can ONLY carry ONE weapon at a time (sorry, pistol/knife don't count)...WHY? In Half-Life 2, one of the pure enjoyments is being able to instantly select from a plethora of enemy-busting weapons! Realistic? No...But KZ2's weaponry is far from realistic and being confined to just one of them at a time significantly reduces the fun factor. Add to that the extreme frustration you repeatedly feel when you're in the heat of battle and you need (or want) to change weapons. Once you find a new one, which normally isn't a problem, you have to approach the weapon and hold the ""square"" button. Pretty easy, except when you're taking heavy fire or have an enemy rushing you...Hold the button a little too long and you pick up the new weapon, then drop it and pick up the old weapon again. Don't hold the button for long enough and you don't even pick up the new weapon before running for cover. Who came up with THIS moronic design?

4) While we're on the subject of weapons, this game has the most AWFUL weaponry of any game I've ever played, even those not on the PS3. The grenade launcher is pretty much useless. How realistic is THAT? Most of the enemy's machine guns are near worthless, unless they're shooting them AT YOU! Shoot any machine gun for more than 1 sec and you're soon shooting over the enemy's head...So you have to constantly stop firing while they never stop firing!?! However, walk around in the EXO scene and you're pretty much in god mode, virtually indestructible. Then in the cruiser scene, you can barely draw a bead on an enemy because for 30 full minutes, the ship is violently shaking every few seconds like it just split in two. It's like different teams developed different scenes and then patched them together in the final hour of development...

5) The field of view and turning around speed are ridiculous! For example, fighting the ATAC alone. It's like Sev's field of view is 90 deg (45 deg right, 45 deg left). For much of the time you can't even see the boss shooting at you, and by the time you turn halfway around to target him, you're shot dead. If anyone truly took 3 sec to turn around on a battlefield, they'd be the first casualty.

6) Finally, the end boss battle is just a JOKE. Use grenades, SMGs, shotties, sniper rifles, even missle launchers with little immediate effect. Get touched by a knife and you're dead. GEE, what fun! Plus you have a ""helper"" who is basically there for the enemy's target practice, not to help you out. And after you ""win"", your character hardly feels like a hero. Perhaps that's some political commentary on war itself...But it's not the kind of feeling I want after plunking down $60 and putting several hours into gameplay. If I wanted to feel like a loser, I'd watch the nightly news every night instead of playing a video game as a temporary escape from reality! Get it, Guerilla?

I'll qualify my review saying it was the ""pre-patch"" version, since a patch was released just 7 DAYS after the game's freakin release date...Supposedly to address, in large part, controller issues. Remember what I said earlier about how someone needs to be fired at Guerilla Games? I realize this may seem weird and inconsistent, but with all of its many shortcomings, I still give KZ2 3 out of 5 stars. There's enough to really get wrapped up in so you can overlook the frustrations that appear in certain phases of the game.

But I tell you, there are times that will have you nearly throwing your controller at the screen or your PS3 out the window!

Zenimax can't tell time very well. It's been 1 hour. Then it crashed back to the dashboard. I fired it back up. Then it said 16 minutes wait time, then it immediately went to 1 second again. I've quit the game, restarted. Restarted the console (hard reset). Nothing...

But there are other words I can label this game with. Generic, short, and largely boring played out scenarios/realms.

Still, I couldn't rank this game as low as two or even the dreaded one star for two very good reasons. One being that the game is actually fun at times and two because I only payed a five for it. Seriously, for under ten, I wholeheartedly recommend the game. Aren't convinced? Then follow me and we'll break it down.

Presentation:

Graphics... are... hmmm; well they aren't terrible and at times show some legs but the truth is the game world is so unconvincingly small you must expect far greater results here. Otherwise everything here is pretty mediocre to average. Characters (yours and the thousand no named clones of enemies) are detailed and animated well enough. The backdrops (IE environments) are so so designed and even absorb occasional environmental damage. The major stickler is however for the loading breaks and short paragraph like playable sections you almost have to wince at the thought that much larger sandbox style games look twice as good as what we have here.

One other thing worth mentioning are the cut scenes. For some reason these look atrocious whether it be the resolution or some other technological feat they somehow managed to make the game's decent engine look far worse then you'd think possible. Seriously I'm not lying.

I always hate analyzing sound solely because either a game sounds good (or accurate) or it doesn't. For the most part this game falls in that first spot. Crackling guns spout the correct noises and even the voice acting by the notables from the movie do a pretty good job here.

Summary:

Graphics are like plunging both index fingers into your ears and very loudly humming the theme song to yourself as you attempt to compare what's on display here next to the bigger dogs. Granted nothing is terrible it's just the circumstances that make it look horrendous.

Narrative:

I honestly wanted to skip this part only because I'm not exactly certain where and how these things fit into the universe. I'll also be honest that I've yet to read the graphic novel/comic books and can only assume things based upon the movie/game. Nevertheless I'll leave this mostly alone.

From what I do understand though is that the main star (Wesly gibson) here sets out after the events that took place during the movie by investigating his lost heritage. This leads him past three guardians from the fraternity to ultimately seeking the answers (I assume) that range from who killed his mother to what it actually takes to kill the fanatical assassin known as the Immortal.

Summary: /Shrug

Gameplay:

Remember that word I mentioned? That exemplifies my initial reactions to this game. It truly feels like you'll press the A button and essentially be stuck to a wall for good. It's not all that hard to become detached from your impenetrable fortresses but with no real sprint button or even a means to dodge any sort of gunfire you'll almost be stuck to a wall for 90% of the game. Things aren't all bad however as clearly the folks at the now departed company Grin really really enjoyed Gears of war cover system and injected a.... wait for it... they adjusted it with a diagonal projection that allows the player to *gasp* jump through the game on a slant!

Sarcasm aside the cover system isn't as smooth nor as refined as say Gears but certainly makes up for it with two specific abilities. One allows your to flank your enemies after suppressing the enemy with blind fire and circle (from cover) behind him. The other feature is the slow mo cover to cover ability which uses adrenaline. Basically it's Wesly's version of the (max payne) slow mo dive.

And of course the game features the coveted bullet curving that has been featured so much. Is it a unique ability? Yes. Does it work well? Kinda. Whats wrong with it? Lots.

For starters this four times out of five equals out to a instant kill button. Remember the uproar for the splinter cell conviction ability? Well this works mostly as good. My other major gripe is it somewhat reminds me of the boomerang from dark sector.

But I digress, the bullet curving does what it sets out do and does an OK job at it. It comes in two varieties to kill with. The regular (normal guns IE 9mm pistols) and explosive rounds (the sub machine gun) that kills everything with one shot and has a possible splash damage at the cost of two doses of adrenaline.

The biggest flaws in this area are it's run time (3-5 hour) and it's simple minded room clearing loading screen every 5 minute game design.

Summary:

Wanted: Weapons of fate is a pretty standard third person shooter in this day and age. It has cover. It has gimmicks (curve/time slow). And like most action games these days it clocks in on the short side at around 20-30 minutes per act with about 9 acts you're looking at a 3 to 5 hour game tops. Is it fun while it lasts? Yes. Is that good enough for you to spend less then ten on it? I'd believe so.

Overall:

What this boils down to is a fun little weekend romp. A short fleeting experience that is not pivotal to anyone existence. It's fun at times. It's weak at times. There's some mild variety in the execution (mounted gun/sniper segments and a rather enjoyable on rails SUPER slow mo sections) but ultimately begs the question. Is a three plus hour fairly generic action game worth your time? Is it?

There are a lot of quests to complete, comparable to Burning Crusades.  The new zones are big, and are visually appealing.  Items in this expansion are also nice.  The game is stable compared to Everquest 2's latest expansion.  Server down time hasn't deviated from the weekly update, aside from server restarts.

Cons:  Every Tuesday brings apprehension that a patch will nerf Death Knight abilities.  You need to reach level 77 and spend even more gold to be able to use flying mounts in Northrend.  The terrain in the lower leveled zones requires you to wait for automated traveling systems.

I like this game, and I like the concepts this game brings to the table compared to other MMOs.  The problem with World of Warcraft in general, is that it's full of griefers and people who lack common ethics and courtesy.

Biggest reason: Game play.  It's basically run and loot and run and loot and run and loot and run and run some more.  You get the point.

Fighting is completely different than the Bio1&2.  What happened to setting traps?  It basically doesn't exist in Infinite.  Bio1&2 allowed the player to strategize about what the best way to fight, defend, or trap in nearly every level.  Infinite is basically all shooting with some plasmids on the side.  Boring.

The story line is cool and of interest, but doesn't come close to absolving the mediocrity of game play and fight sequences.

And...what's up with the graphics?  No improvements that I noticed whatsoever.  It's like 2K just decided ""why mess w/ success"", stick to the same engine and same basic look, why improve.

And...the sound effects are a direct export from Bio1&2, nothing new.  Really?  How lame.

Unfortunately, not well. Warcraft practically requires players to use the keyboard - ctrl/shift to do multiple unit selection, and hotkeys to give orders. This makes it very tough to play well one-handed. A generation later with Warcraft II Blizzard would get it right with the control scheme, but it's bound to frustrate seasoned RTS gamers here.

The other major problem is with AI. The computer is exceptionally weak, building tiny ineffective attack forces and waiting for you to raid its base. It does not defend well against ranged attackers at all. Once defending units are killed off, the computer never bothers to rebuild them. And it ALWAYS falls for being 'baited out' by a fast-moving troop, leading its entire army into a trap in pursuit of something it could never catch. One Human level asked me to rescue some peasants and rebuild my town before attacking the Orc base - but since I couldn't find them, I simply stormed the enemy with my starting units, and crushed them outright.

To compensate, the computer cheats - always starting with a free (sizable) base, while you have to build from scratch. It ignores the economy entirely, instead building units on a set schedule and at no cost, but it is still incapable of putting up much resistance.

Bad AI extends all the way down to unit pathfinding - units mill around haphazardly and run into walls, stopping them in their tracks for a second before they head off in another random direction. More than once I ordered my units to travel across the map, but they instead wandered off to a dead end and eventually just gave up! The bad pathfinding adds more to the value of ranged units, since they don't have to stop-and-go maneuver around your own units to gang up on an attacker.

These things could probably still be okay if the game had some still-relevant multiplayer, but unfortunately it is based on IPX or direct modem connection and doesn't allow user-created maps. And the campaign isn't even compelling, since most missions just give you a short blurb of ""yet another enemy base stands in the way of our victory, crush it"" and then you're on your way.

The graphics are low-resolution but nicely detailed, and I have no complaints. Music for PC is MIDI (how disappointing - there is CD audio here too, but it's only for Macintosh players!), and the sound effects are decent but lack variation.

Unless you are a die-hard RTS gamer or Warcraft fanatic, I would not recommend this game - it's too easy, the controls too frustrating, and the storyline is not engaging.

Those guys must be laughing about how much money they made on the day of release for this game. They put in little work (graphics wise) and made billions the first day.

It does have some good missions but every episode has good missions, I expected way more than they gave on this game. The best parts are the first mission when you are robbing the bank before the game actually starts and the last mission when you get to kill the intelligence agency boss. most other missions are bland and thoughtless.

The language is inappropriate as well, I do not know why they can not have people talk for more than 5 seconds without cursing.

3.0,False,"10 28, 2016",A3SMD3T0QTN109,B01GWTYXSC,DF,"I've tried quite a few headphones for gaming on my PS4 and my desktop, and these are an interesting concept with some pros and cons.

The first main pro is the feel of the build quality.  The metal, the stitching on the head cushion, the volume wheel, the 3.5mm cord all feel as nice and solid as any headphones I've ever used, and are nicer than my Sony headphones that cost 4 times as much.  If you plan on being seen in your headphones, these are a nice choice, and if you're the kind of person who really likes aesthetics, these are a good option for you.

Having to recharge with a usb cable is an acceptable hassle for cordless headphones.  These of course aren't cordless.  The cord is shorter than my other similar headphones, but when attached to your dualshock controller it can be nice to have less cord in your way.  But that kinda gets to the problem: these still have that cord in your way.  If you want less cord in your way and don't mind recharging headphones, you can get wireless headphones, often with surround sound, for a similar price to these.

These have a beautiful sound, and I suppose that's the most important feature.  They aren't as loud as 40mm headphones should be, and I think that helps avoid distortion.  I think anyone wanting louder headphones will eventually have hearing loss.  The boom mike sounds much better than the in-built mike, but this is mainly news for phone calls.  If you're chatting in games, the audio quality is going to be low no matter how nice the mike is.  Having the extra mike is a good idea.

At the end of the day, these are competing against gaming headphones that look and feel cheap in comparison, but have far more features and I'd say convenience.  Once you've used surround sound headphones for games, it's hard to downgrade, and wireless headphones are just more comfortable all around.  The three stars reflect what I consider to be an average value.  Great sound and great finish on a product that does less stuff for the money.

Creed is very console orientated. It's selling points are it's visuals- I have a high end pc and can experience everything on full settings as smooth as silk, and it's atmosphere.

On that note, this game is perhaps best game in years to capture the atmosphere and 'feel' of a immersive gaming experience. It actually feels like you are walking around the Holy land, with great shadow effects and lighting. The people who move around you are the closest to actual human beings, without actually being walking digital people. Also, there are no edge effects with this. Everything is very smooth, no rock face is spoiled by a jutting graphic triangle or polygon.

The gameplay is far more simple than I expected, going on what others have spoken of. I can run up to a building, and infact climb and leap over buildings very easily. I think the only real issue is dropping from the hanging position, but that's just experimentation with keys (I'm PC version). Altir is an incredible acrobat and his motoions are some of the best I have yet seen. Having Altir climb and scale walls and buildings is perhaps the games most impressive feat. Dust and small stones fall away under his feet and as you move the camera around him, whether suspended or still moving you can view the people moving below him. That is the shiny end of the coin.

I enjoy the combat system, being able to engage multiple opponants in a realistic manner is fun. Three on one is far more exciting than one on one.

The cons. . well, there is not much in the way of interraction in the game. Sure, you speak to people, but it's not open ended, it's all mission and side mission based. Saving citizens from the guards to give scholar and vigilante aid is fine, but it gets a little bit silly after a while. YOu don't really want to jump down from up high to save somebody just to have some vigilantes appear that you really don't need just to have to climb back up again. Also, it defeats the purpose of stealth and unseen death when you slay guards, to evade them again and carry on like nothing happened. There is not much to 'chew on' in terms of story and side mission. I would love to be able to have a RP element. To perhaps drag your dead into dark corners, barrels, through open doorways. I would like to be able to purchase items from the market vendors, perhaps getting a better blade or having my blade sharpened .. simple details. Can you imagine something as applaudably immersive as Creed combined with something like Oblivion, the RP extravaganza? Creed innovates in a way that paves the way forward for future releases.

The last but not least of the 'issues' with Creed is that it is difficult to exit the game. You have to leave the memory, have your other character get off the table, then quite to the menu, select the name of your saved data and then exit .. that's far too overly complicated.

My advice, get this one in used condition or on sale. It's not that it's not great value for money, but Oblivion cost roughly the same amount and there was far more to experience with it.

It's certainly a worthwhile experience for a gamer, you will spend time marvelling at details and hunting for your next 'job' whilst enjoying the detailed vistas of the far East- get it if not for the experience of moving through the detailed towns and cities.

At first this game was awesome, it had all the prospectives of measuring up to be a fantastic RTS (Real Time Strategy) but it went all down hill from there.

The game - as usual - follows the average fantasy theme with Orcs, Humans, Elves and Undead (Warcraft 3 anyone?) that was a little bit of drag. But if that's what your after, that's all well and good, but the main problem I have to pick with this game is, for some reason it's hard to all buggery to do. Even on easy, without proper healing characters, etc. you just die as soon as you meet the enemy who do double to triple the amount of damage compared to yourself. There's no even stakes at all in this game. In the beginning chapters you just have to get through it with hoping that the enemy doesn't hit your main character otherwise it's game over. At least Warcraft had Altars in the beginning levels!

This game gets annoying at how low your characters HP, damage, etc. are. You can go in with a full-blown army and just be wiped out by 6 enemy units.

If you're in for a challenge, this is the game to play but I warn you this game doesn't come anywhere close to Warcraft!

1. Tracking issues: The mouse has a dual sensor laser. It's sensitive. If you get dirt or dust on your mouse pad, it gets on the laser. Use a q-tip and some rubbing alcohol and clean it once in a while.

2. Make sure mouse pad is free from things like dust and hair because the laser can pick it up.

3. This mouse doesn't work with some types of mouse pads. Mine doesn't like the hard plastic. Tried a $30 Corsair hard mouse pad and it sucked. My $4 junk pad works better. I've heard great reviews about the Razor Goliathus. I'll be getting one soon because people report this mouse working great on it and it's designed with dual lasers in mine.

4. I heard it doesn't like dark surfaces. However, my current pad is black and seems to work ok.

So keep the dust and hair out of the lens and have the right mouse pad.

Most customizable mouse ever. Change your palm rest and thumb rest so you can hit that sniper button (which is awesome). I have mine adjusted to 50%. Makes long range way easier.

Cons: only complaint I have is that the software takes some figuring out. But once you do, it's pretty cool. I set my thumb scroll wheel as volume controls and use it all the time.

Update: Still using the mouse but the tracking likes to jump around sometimes and now the middle mouse button is acting up. Not worth the price if it doesn't last very long.

The over-the-shoulder perspective is now a staple in the action genre, plus the game was so well designed, it is one of the few games that keeps bringing me back after the initial sparkle wears off.

Resident Evil 5 borrows heavily from Resident Evil 4. Having said that, comparison is inevitable. And initially, it seems like more of the same good stuff. But is it really?

The first difference that's gonna hit you in the graphics. Yes. They're gorgeous. You will find yourself spending time in each level just marveling at the details and effects.

Along with the improved graphics, the combat is also sped up a little bit and the game is perfectly paced. The action is fast and fun, and brings back the Resident Evil 4 feel pretty well. The gameplay alone makes it worthy of a rental. Resident Evil 5 also introduces Co-op gameplay where a friend assumes the role of Sheva Alomar, partner to the main character, Chris Redfield. Co-op is implemented well and is fun to play with a friend online or on the same screen. But that's where the good ends.

The game is short. It'll take you 10 hours to beat the game, maybe 12 if you are the exploring type. The game is not designed as well as Resident Evil 4; without going into too much detail, you will only have reason to play the game through twice before its just no fun anymore. Besides the combat, you will partake is some excruciatingly easy puzzles, in which you are basically hand-fed the solutions to. Bosses are easy as well. Everything feels very dumbed down compared to Resident Evil 4. Even the inventory system has been re-designed to make it simpler for the player.

One of the things that made Resident Evil 4 so intense was the fact that the player was always low on ammo and tight on space. Battles had to be meticulously planned in the inventory and since ammo was sparse, the player had to be crafty. That was fun. But in Resident Evil 5, you are never really strapped for ammo, and you can almost always use your partner as a pack mule. It changes the game mechanic, making it much less interesting.

Speaking of intense, one of the things about Resident Evil 4 that made it so intense was the fact that it was truly scary and maintained a sense of horror and suspense. It made the game immursive; you really felt like you were alone in the dark. In Resident Evil 5, you are neither. Thanks to your partner and the sunny African setting, you'll never be alone or in the dark. Horror has left the game in Resident Evil 5, and with it went an undeniable sense of charm and excitement that is woefully missed.

Because that sense of Horror is absent and the game is more action oriented now, it seems kind of strange that the developers stuck with the setup where the player cannot walk and shoot at the same time. I know other reviewers address this all too often and to be honest, it is the most minor of my complaints in my opinion. Nevertheless, it is still worth noting.

This is not to say it is impossible to have fun in Resident Evil 5. It is a perfect rental, because it can be beaten quickly and once it is beaten, there is not much worth-while to return to. I'd say definitely find a way to play it, like co-op-ing it at a friends house, because the first time is a blast. Otherwise, I'd stick to Resident Evil 4. But trust me, you don't want to be the loser who actually paid full admission while the disc sits on the shelf collecting dust for years to come.

I love the story, and the combat was vastly improved for this second outing which I loved.  I also loved how it imported my Mass Effect 1 character.  That totally hooked me, and has me excited about my choices I made in Mass Effect 2 how it will effect 3.  So well done Bioware.

My biggest problem was that it was too similar to Mass Effect 1.  There really wasn't a lot new introduced to Mass Effect 2 then 1.  I mean, new combat sure, but there we were, on a ship, just a little nicer, traveling pretty much the same.  And the whole game is picking up new people, doing loyal missions, complete game.  Just not really a lot of variance.  I like in the first one how we could walk around the citadel in this beautiful environment, go to the ship, and talk to the crew.  This one, is pretty much exactly the same, without the Citadel.  So I know it's a sequel, so gameplay must stay a little similar, but almost exact?  Seemed boring and lazy to me.  Even the ship was almost exactly the same!  Most sequels I've played offer variance that make it different, this one really didn't for me.  Even with the battle being better, the story was better in the first one for me.  Maybe because it was new.  I still enjoyed the story here, but I wasn't amazed by it.

My biggest complaint, and this is where my ""getting older"" comment comes from, is that was just too long.  I like doing as many side missions as possible and my final time clocked in close to 60 hours.  Near the end, I just didn't care anymore about the plot, I just wanted it over.  I don't want to feel that way at the end of games.  I wish it was 25-30 hours including side missions.

There was some incredible scenes, and the story was very well done.  However, I just felt it was just too long, the story got repetitive for me, and was just a little let down.

First, I must say, I tend to like it a bit better than Resistance: Fall Of Man, mainly because it's a bit different with the overall features. You wear this nifty Time-Shifting type of suit that can enable you to manipulate time. Which, is a really cool idea, and it can be quite fun blasting bad guys when you're using these features. A LOT OF FUN!

The graphics are awesome, it's really fast-paced, and is a blast to play.

BUT, after some time of playing, I got a bit bored with it. Simply because it's constant shooting...shooting....and more shooting...which normally I wouldn't mind, but, I would like some other challenges, or other things to do besides just shooting, shooting, shooting, and dodging ballistic missiles & projectiles. Maybe that's what I'm not crazy about...I guess I like games a bit more on the slower-side. Things in this game get a bit to crazy, and hectic all at the same time, and sometimes you just don't know what to do, where to go, or what's going on, and 2 seconds later you're dead!

I love SHOOTER-TYPE GAMES, but, I like them a bit slower, and with other kinds of challenges....What I mean by this is: In other Shooter type games (ala: Sniper Elite, or SOCOM series of games)...While they are all shooter games, you have to incorporate stealth, and other means of combat, to complete missions. I guess I like that stuff more than your more traditional kind of shooter game.

I guess I just get bored shooting the same thing over & over again...  :) I guess I'd like to see more of that kind of thing in other shooter games.

Gameplay wise it's a hack and slash. It's like the previous games where you choose your weapon types and hack and slash your way to victory. You have magic which can buff/debuff/heal/etc. The game is very easy as you can hack and slash and just fly away to heal most of the time. The flying is kind of bad but it's there.

Fighting games never interested me so I was surprised that I initially found this game very enjoyable.  Part of that enjoyment probably came from the graphics.  Just about every other review has raved about them, and they are right.  The graphics are great.  On several occasions I found myself looking at the detail of the sets and not fighting.
However, once you've gotten past the eye candy you'll find there isn't too much there.  Playing through the story mode is somewhat interesting since you learn a bit about each of the characters and get to see some cut scenes, but story mode is much too short (in terms of the number of fights) and the stories are laughable at best.
This game is worth having around to play against other people, as it is the only way it provides lasting entertainment.  Other than that, it isn't worth keeping on the shelf.

The game show format, taken from the real-life Family Game Night that airs on US channel The Hub, keeps everything very short and superficial so the game is only good for a quick distraction instead of something you can invest a hour in.

The featured games, and their alternates, are as follows:

Bop It!

A lot like Twister from Family Game Night 3. All you have to do is hit the right buttons on cue. The AI of the computer opponent is terrible so you can beat it in less than 30 seconds.

Bop It! EXTREME

The exact same only with a couple of extra button functions.

Boggle Flash

The only game in the show that requires any skill. There are five letters on the table, each letter makes a point, first player to reach 25 points wins.

Boggle Flash: FIVE LETTER

No computer opponent. You must make as many five-letter words as you can in a time limit.

Connect 4 Basketball

You throw basketballs into the grid. A tiny bit of skill is required in order win, but it's mostly random where the balls end up.

Connect 4 Basketball: SPEED SHOT

Exact same only you can throw as many shots as you like instead of both players waiting for their turn.

Sorry! Sliders

A sort of lawn-bowling type of game where you slide your pewter token onto a scoring ring. It's a very slow game and the least enjoyable.

Sorry! Sliders: SUMO

The same game with sumo wrestler pieces on the scoring ring that you need to bash out the way.

Yahzee Bowling

A bowling ball knocks over dice pins where you decide which to keep and which to roll again. Absolutely zero skill is required to play this game. It is completely random.

Yahzee Bowling: CRAZY LANE

The exact same except for 3 extra dice pins on the lane. Still no skill needed.

The alternates are not optional for play in the game-show format, only separately. As for the game-show format itself, you receive a Monopoly cash card for every game you win, which is added up at the end. This seems like a fair method of scoring but the totaling scene at the end takes AGES, as well as being completely unfair and making absolutely no sense whatsoever.

Family Game Night 4 feels very rushed and unfinished. From a visual standpoint it looks like 2006 shovelware for the Nintendo Wii. There are graphical errors all over the place and some elements are clearly very low-res GIF files blown up to larger proportions. Not what you expect or want from an HD console.

It's worth getting for the trophies they give away by the bucketful. The most difficult of which is 'Super Star' which requires 50 episodes to be completed. It's a grind, and I recommend you go for this first as you'll probably get most of the others in the process. Don't bother going any in the individual games first, it'll just waste time.

The game is beautifully detailed and some of the hard to reach area's are a visual wonder.  As an mmorpg ffxi gives you basically a open world to explore with probably over 100 maps that are richly detailed and time consuming to explore.  This game can easily take away countless hours of your time without you knowing the time past.

Gameplay

Gameplay is based on cooperation.  It is very rare that an individual can go out on their own and complete tasks.  Most of the game requires a minimum of another person or a group of 6-18 ppl to complete.  As the game progresses and you get further along in xp and lvls the high end tasks require multiple uninterrupted hours with 12 or more members.  Usually the rewards are totally random and you are not garanteed anything.  Most of the high end items drop maybe once and everyone there wants it so its a toss up on who gets the item which usually is rewarded to the person that plays the game the most and helps out the most.  If you are a person with limited time to play its hard to get rewarded correctly.

Controls

On the xbox i would not recommend playing this game without a usb keyboard.  Tried it once and it was horrible trying to type without it.  Once you have a keyboard the game plays well and is perfectly detailed.  Without a keyboard you will be completely miserable so don't do it to yourself.

Graphics

Simply stunning!  You see the sun rise and set.  The moon rise and set.  Ocean waves crash at your feet as you run in the sand.  Ghosts haunt you in mines.  Tornados touch down in the deserts.  Lightning strikes in the backround.  You get the idea.

Replayablility

Its end game there is always something to do.  Many hours can be spent just doing one thing.  You will spend hundreds of hours getting one character to max level with full caped xp traits.

Price

12.95 a month with an extra 1 per character you make past the main.

Value

Once you dish out the money for the game and pay for the keyboard its still below an average xbox game.  It pays for itself over time.  If you play it a lot and don't mind the monthly fee then it can keep ya home instead of going to the movies etc.

True to past ff games

Yes and no!  It has the ffxi feel with jobs you can play like blackmage whitemage Warrior.  It makes you feel that you must work as a team like true ff games.  Missions are very in depth and have a long backstory.  It falls behind on some things like summoning.  The pets are while pretty not as we have seen in the past.  Weaponskills or limit breaks are pretty eh.  Most of the time you won't realize you activated a weaponskill they are that unnoticable.  Limit breaks or 2 hours are what they are called do exactly what they say.  Take 2 hours to get a new one.  Each job has a different 2 hour some are ok like redmage gets chainspell which allows it to cast spells over and over again with no cool off time or casting time.  Some are terrible where for example samurai gets to do 3 weaponskills at a time instead of one.

Anyway i give this game a 4/5 for fun because when you first start there is nothing like it the game is just amazing.  The point off is for it limiting you to have to party.

Overall i give it a 3 since it is a bit old you have to pay for it a month and it gets really tiresome doing the 3-4 hour events on a regular basis.",LOOOOOONNNNNGGGGGG,1256688000,,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},
3.0,False,"10 23, 2009",A2RSJ3FJ19CYA4,B002E1OXVU,Joshua Workman,"It's not terrible, but they made a large number of poor choices. In some ways, it's better than last year, but in many ways, it's actually inferior. For one, there's all this music in the game, including the theme songs for a few of the recent PPVs, but you can't use them for your CAWs entrances. What's that about? I can't afford to download all my songs on my list and port them to my PS3 for that, I just have too many.

I also got my wish of getting the Abilities system back, but until I get a word somewhere about how to unlock them, they gypped CAWs in that department, not allowing them to have Resiliency and the like right off the bat, when you get mostly useless abilities if the ones that are availiable to them right away aren't the ones you want them to have. I mean, what were they thinking? Last year, we had to unlock them and you could start Career Mode with an actual Superstar or Diva to find out what you need to do to get them. This year, you can change them to suit your whims, but even if you do Career Mode with someone who is there, they don't freakin' tell you what you need to do to get them! Although, there are abilities that weren't in there last year.

And why is it that half the single player Road to WrestleMania stories are for unrepentant heels? Seriously. Edge and Randy Orton are two of the characters you can use in RtWM, and in both stories, they're as intolerable as ever. In fact, Randy Orton's story has Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase making an even worse heel turn, and they keep Orton the same. I mean come on, if that were to happen on the actual shows, Randy Orton would be cast into a face role. Or, if they wanted Orton to stay the same, it'd be DiBiase and Rhodes making the face turn, but not here. Their characters all just get worse. What were they thinking?!

And why is it that the music that plays when you're doing anything but playing matches and making your own stories that of heels? I don't want to see The Miz, so what makes them think I want to hear his music? I can't bloody stand any of them who are heels whose music they chose for that. Mark Henry and MVP don't count because they're faces on the actual shows despite still being heels in this game.

And where do they get off putting us on a points system for our CAWs? 48 points. That's what we get, and if we can't get the desired look with that, then we can't have the person we wanted to create. They may look like they're actually people who are there, but they're not as flashy as the real ones. Oh, and the Paint Tool is no help if you're not good at art. Still, I favor more simple character designs, so for many of them I could create, 48 points is more than enough.

Inclusion of Legends like The Rock, Cowboy Bob Orton, and the Million Dollar Man Ted DiBiase is a nice touch, though. Even if you can't use them in Road to WrestleMania. Seriously. They got the Million Dollar Man and Dusty Rhodes to do voices in this game, so why couldn't they have a Legends Road to WrestleMania and have one or both of them be the ones? And since we're on the subject of RtWM again, I think it should be mentioned that the only Diva you can use in that mode is Mickie James. And yes, Stone Cold Steve Austin was only available through GameStop. Sorry.

But it's WWE, and you can have your CAWs become champions. That's good, especially when you consider all the titles up for grabs in this game compared to previous iterations. Seriously, you could have one of your CAWs become Champion of Champions.

And on the subject of CAWs, if you use them in any match, not just Career Mode, they gain ability points which you use to increase their skills. To improve said skills, they have to level up. To level up said skills, you have to consistently have them do that in matches.

You may be noticing a pattern here. I'm mostly focusing on the negative things. That's because they didn't make enough good choices! I actually prefer SvR 2009, and that game is horrible compared to previous SVR entries. Not nearly as jacked up as SvR 2010, though. I am seriously disappointed with this game. I am not kidding when I say this game is brand new, but already I'm eager for SvR 2011.

3.0,False,"03 24, 2013",A3DGCNADDUMFUL,B00005BW7Q,ZeeZee,"There comes a time in console gaming when we are between generations, waiting for the next hardware to arrive so that new games can be released along with it.  There currently are a limited number of new games in the pipeline for the current consoles, as developers focus resources on games that will probably be released next year.  I check daily for news of a new Tri-Ace or Mistwalker game, with no news.  This can be a good thing, however, as it gives us a chance to go back and play some of the games from the previous generation(s).  As a result, my PS2 has been pulled from the closet and placed next to the 360 and Wii.  I decided that it was a good time to pick up this trilogy.  It may seem pointless to review a game that is 11 years old, but the portable gaming systems and PSN / XBOX Live / Wii Virtual Console have given new life to old games.  Old games are often regarded as being among the best, and many of them are ""new"" to younger gamers that never got to play them when they were originally released.

Xenosaga was one of those games that I had always considered playing.  I am a big fan of Xenogears, and I was blown away by the hype for this game when it was announced around 2001 or so.  But after seeing its direction and witnessing it first-hand, at a friend's house, I decided that there were many other games that I should play instead.  I've had 11 years to attempt to curb my initial disappointments with the game.  I haven't decided if it's allowed me to warm up to the title or it's strengthened my disappointments.  I consider myself to be a veteran of console RPGs, as I've been playing them for at least 24 years now, across all manner of consoles.  I still have my original NES Dragon Warrior and Final Fantasy carts, as well as many SNES, Genesis and TurboGrafx 16 games.  I love console RPGs and I've played games from virtually every major series at some point.

And that's why I have a problem with Xenosaga.  It is apparent that it excels at absolutely nothing when compared to the rest of the games out there.  Positive reviews on this game seem to merely be from apologists that want to hold this game in the same high regard as Xenogears, or maybe even gamers that prefer to watch anime over playing an engaging or challenging games.

One of my biggest complaints is the audio.  The audio is simply a disaster.  I've come to the conclusion that Mitsuda simply doesn't want to work anymore, on anything.  Once one of my favorite composers, he puts so little effort into his music these days that you could just as easily insert any third-rate composer into a game and have it turn out all the same.  There might be approximately three main tracks throughout the whole game.  More often than not, however, the game is completely silent.  The dungeon and battle music are so annoying an uninspired, which is a shame because you will be listening to them for countless hours.  This is one of the first times where I've ever played a game with the volume turned down so that I could listen to my own music collection while playing the game.  Only when you get to the final area are you actually treated with good music.  The final boss battle and ending music are indeed good, but it's not worth playing for 40 hours to finally get to this.  The same man that created the awesome music for Xenogears / Chrono Trigger / Chrono Cross (another junk game, aside from the soundtrack) offers virtually nothing to game music anymore.

And it isn't even just the music.  The voice acting is pretty disappointing as well.  I know that many people have preferred Shion's voice actor in this game over Episode II, but I simply cannot stand her.  It's not that she is a bad voice actor, but she just seems wrong for the part.  She sounds like a 50-year-old woman playing a character in her 20s because that's exactly what she is.  I would say that the only characters that I really found to be tolerable were Kos-Mos, Jr. and Ziggy.

The battle system is terribly slow and boring.  It's like a watered down version of the Xenogears battle system, but you spend more time watching animations than actually playing.  The progressions between actions are crude and lack any degree of fluidity.  It literally takes 10 seconds to do even the most basic attack because you have to watch charging animations.  To add to this, the AWGS are absolutely useless (I *never* used them except for the parts where you are required to use them) and there is hardly ever any real degree of challenge.  There used to be a time when RPGs offered some real challenge and required actual strategy, but someone decided that this should take a backseat in this game's design.  To give you an idea, I beat the Proto Dora in less than 4 rounds, and it never got a single chance to attack.  I finished the last two bosses on similar terms.  I think that there was only one battle that was remotely challenging, early on, but only because it's the point in the game where it assumes that you've already learned the battle mechanics.  A poor battle system like this is a problem since, while enemies can be seen, most paths are too thin to actually avoid battle.  It's very much a precursor to the disastrous Final Fantasy XIII in almost every respect.  The games are so similar in terms of gameplay, slow battle progression, terrible music, and sterile linear environments, that the resemblance is uncanny (graphics technology aside).  Dungeons literally take hours to complete because you are wandering about fighting enemies on linear paths.  I wouldn't actually mind this if the story was at all captivating, but it simply is not.

You spend approximately 30 hours waiting for something interesting to happen in this game's story.  By the time you get to the end of the game, it seems like it might actually turn around.  Instead, you are left on a cliffhanger for the second game.  There is absolutely nothing in this game that actually develops the series plot or characters.  It's just 35-50 hours of pointless scenarios in 3 hour dungeons.

Menus are poorly designed.  To apply the numerous types of points to your characters, you have to navigate to no less than 4 different menus.  The system lacks any degree of refinement and the point system is needlessly convoluted.  In contrast, a good game would have placed them all into a common menu to apply points to learn skills or enhance stats.  Generally, there is no good reason to apply points to the strength of tech attacks early on, because there is little payoff.  It is, however, good practice to apply points to the tech attack speed, and apply points directly to a character's ether defense and vitality.  But the game does such a poor job of defining which things are useful and which are not, that it is probably easy for some gamers to waste points on things that have very little return (HP) or useless spells.  The vast majority of spells that are useful belong to a sole character, but these can easily be transferred to everyone else, completely negating anything that it unique about the character.  As such, you will probably stick with 3 characters throughout the entire game because the alternative may mean that you are going to spend time grinding for points to get everyone's tech / skill ether points on par with the most-played characters.  There is no incentive to use anyone else.

Visually, the game was dated even by 2002's standards.  Environments are sterile futuristic grey corridors and characters are messy blobs, with PS2's characteristic ""jaggy"" features.  The lack of progressive scan even in 2002 was unforgivable when even the lowly Dreamcast supported it in nearly every game with the VGA box in 1999, as well as the Gamecube with component cables.  And while graphics are not the most important part of an RPG, it's annoying to have to be forced to watch 10-15 second animations for boring attacks.  The only time that these can be skipped is when the game designers ""cheat"" by carefully inserting an MPEG2 video animation into the game.  Kos-Mos' XBUSTER is one such example.

Playing through Takahashi (and Soraya Saga's) games of the past two generations makes me realize something that many people do not consider.  They simply can't do it without Masato Kato and many of the others that were involved in Xenogears and Chrono Trigger.  I am one of very few that also didn't really like Xenoblade, which I felt was artificially inflated with boring fetch-quests in order to create a greater ""perceived value"" for the game.  There simply was very little meat to the plot and the gameplay.  Interestingly enough, I see that Kato was involved in Monolith's Baten Kaitos and I've read that it has superior writing.  However, I have not played it (yet).

To close, it's simply unforgivable to create a 40-hour linear RPG game that does absolutely so little with the plot or gameplay.  This game literally serves no purpose but to introduce you to the next game, which I hear also takes a turn to focus only on a few characters rather than the plot of the actual game.  We'll see how it goes when I begin part II today.  I may be part of a minority that will actually like Episode II better than the first.

This game is literally the ""Star Wars Episode 1: Phantom Menace"" of Takahashi's ambitious Xenogears series and prequels.  And while nobody will officially admit to the connections to Square's properties for legal reasons, all of the basic lore is there.  It may be a ""re-imaging"" of the series, but it contains many of the core plot elements that were relevant for Xenogears; so much so that many of the terminology and the timeline is the same as what was proposed in ""Perfect Works"" and Xenogears.",It is Evident Why I Ignored This For 11 Years.,1364083200,,,

I have also added my own views on what made this game not as totally awesome as I had initially expected (for the benefit of the potential reader, of course; no need to thank me, I consider myself a real life hero of sorts).

1)
You might read (I'm too lazy to cite sources) in the occasional review that this game is short.  This is an understatement.  I beat the game in under 10 hours, obtaining every possible augmentation for the beam katana, every wrestling move (I think), every fitness upgrade.  This is not something that should happen in a game I shelled out $50 for.  I should have to complete so many story-related missions to finish the main game that I get sick of it, leave the game in my closet for a couple of decades, then resell it on eBay as a collectors item for oodles of cash (or PayPal or whatever).

2)
This is not GTA.  There is no reason to complain about not being able to run around while decapitating hookers.  It's not an open-ended exploration game with multiple branching choice tree...things.  It's a third-person action game, that's made in such a stupid way as to give gullible gamers the illusion of nonlinearity.  Yeah, there's not enough to do in the town (which is unnecessarily huge, by the way), but you shouldn't have to do much anyway.  Unless you spend all your money on clothes (in which case I  pity you), you shouldn't have to complete more than a few side missions in order to obtain the cash necessary to upgrade your weapon (and yourself), as well as buy your way into the next ranked fight.

3)
If you had to murder your way through 20 hours worth of generic sword-wielding men in black business suits, then you can complain about repetition.  If the indiscriminate killing is under 10 hours, then it's still fun.  Especially since all those fights are just warm-ups for the boss battles.  Which, by the way, are awesome.  They're truly the highlight of the game and the only reason I gave it 3 stars.

4)
The plot doesn't make any sense, so don't even bother with it.  Some of the dialog is funny, but Travis has a terrible voice actor and his delivery is always off.  Most of the villains are pretty good though, so it balances out.

5)
Teh graphics suck.  Really.  GTA 3 on the PS2 looks just as good.  After playing Super Mario Galaxy I can see that you can do better on the Wii.

Stylistically speaking, the whole 8-bit, retro menu thing is kinda' lame.  It would go well with crisp, beautiful graphics, but with the stuff No More Heroes is showing, the menus only remind me of how ugly the rest of the game looks.

The graphics in Starfighter are good, but, more than anything else, they reminded me of how amazing Rogue Squadron's graphics were on the N64 a number of years ago.  Another problem is the fact that the vehicles of Episode One are simply not as interesting (and, thus, as fun to fly) as those of the original trilogy.  Additionally, the first three or four levels were down right boring and I was soon regretting my purchase.
The game does eventually pick up.  There are some very cool levels which are both graphically stunning and a lot of fun to play.  The use of both planet side and space battles is also a nice touch; something that was conspicuously missing from Rogue Squadron.  The control is also top notch.  While the graphics aren't is good as they could have been (it's the PS2, for cryin' out loud), the sound is top notch.  The voice acting ranges from adequate to superb and the character's voices are actually somewhat unique (a rarity is Star Wars games).  The cutscenes are also pretty impressive.
While I would recommend this game, my biggest peeve is that it's WAY too short.  First off, the levels are too short.  Often times, I found myself wishing that a level would have gone on for another five or ten minutes.  This game is supposed to represent inter-stellar war, yet most of the battles could be completed in a couple of minutes.  More than anything else, though, the entire experience is over way to quickly.  It took me around five hours to complete all of the standard missions: on the same day I bought it.  There need to be about twice as many levels as are found in this game; just as soon as things start to get interesting, they're over.  Luckily, bonus levels and bonus ships do make the game last a little longer.

It's also easy to find missions, although sometimes the missions themselves are too far above or below you to be worth your while.
The downsides are that the game is not very easy to learn, and that the players are often more akin to bullies in a schoolyard.  PotBS was PvP centric at launch, but updates have tilted the balance even more so.  If you have to battle someone a level or two above you, you will lose.  And if you're not careful, one or more high-level characters will jump you, sink your ship, and steal everything with no shame.  If you are looking for Roleplay, you might be a bit hampered: while character creation allows a great deal of creativity, the emotes interface is clumsy and weird (and don't forget that most will speak to you in movie pirate tones, complete with ""Arr!""s).
If you can find people who will play with you it helps because you can be sure you never sail alone.  One of the cleverest details you'll run across is the political balance of various ports:  each faction can capture and dominate a port, making it difficult for anyone from opposing factions to enter.  While ports are under contest, players from any side can sail to the port and jump into the fray, affecting the outcome.

On the positive side, CSI fans will enjoy the tie-ins. You get the cool voices of the real actors. The visuals look like the actors, although at times it appears you're watching a badly dubbed Japanese movie based on the bad lip synching. You get cool music and cut-scenes just like in the TV show. It really does feel at times like you're ""in"" the TV world.
But where this COULD have been a great game with more quality testing and work, they obviously rushed to get this to the public and rake in the cash. The game crashed constantly on several testing machines. You now have to have the CD in the drive to play, even if you do a full install. They warn you that only ""regular"" CD players work well - that it won't necessarily work on a DVD player or CD-writer. Since most new machines come with those options and not just a plain CD player, that could cause trouble for lots of people.
Even when the game does play smoothly, the gameplay is iffy. People vanish. Items vanish. There's a patch on the Ubi website but it doesn't help with many of these issues.
The gameplay is supposed to have you investigate the clues, talk to suspects and figure out what has happened. But most of the times the clues are pretty obvious. The questions are all very leading, in essence telling you what to do next most of the time.
For the price on the box, you'd really expect more than the 5 hours or so of gameplay you get as a result. Maybe if the puzzles were harder you'd play a given mission for longer. I suppose with all the crashes, it does actually take you longer to get things going smoothly, replaying missions to try to get past the buggy spots.
Still, if you're a fan of CSI, you'll want to get this to immerse yourself further in the CSI world. Who knows, in another few months they might actually put out enough patches to fix the bugs - but the gameplay itself will still be simple and quick. Hopefully before CSI 3 comes out they'll do a bit more development and gameplay testing.","Buggy and Quick, but fun for CSI Fans",1083974400,13,,

3.0,False,"07 13, 2009",A1PPOI55JO8VU1,B000ZK7ZOE,S.Papstein,"Open world games sure have changed these last few years. It used to be that we'd cruise around the block in GTA, cappin' fools and jackin Bently's. But some people think of that as to low key. InFamous ""kicks it up a notch"" by having an open world that you can scale buildings, throw gernades at cars, and suck the souls out of pedestrians. A sandbox game as a superhero.

 A electric bomb has gone off in the fictional city of Emprie City, killing thousands of citizens, but leaving protagonist Cole McGrath alive with electric super powers. InFamous' story cant be taken seriously at all. Just like the art of the cut-scenes, it all feels like a comic book. A really bad comic. The story of InFamous deffinitly is not the selling point of the game, but with a plot that gets progressingly worse as you go, terribly corny enimies and totally unlovable characters makes this feel like a campy remake (although it is an origional IP).

 Sucker Punch has been around the block a few times with the platforming series Sly Cooper, and platforming is a main aspect of InFamous as well The game also mixes a little bit of  Assasin's Creed climbing as well. Any part of a building is considered a ledge, all you half to do is just jump to it. Cole can hop, skip and parkour around the city beautifully. Although a little floaty with it's physics (feeling a little Sly Cooper-ish), InFamous has lain down a great way to platform. Being the electronic freak he is, Cole can also move around the city by electric sliding on rails and power lines. Platforming is InFamous' main feature, and Sucker Punch has masterfully exicuted this.

 Although bad guys are funky as could be (fiends, transients and a cult take over a town), they still cause havoc that you must stop. But hey, you got electric super powers! Combat, as fun as it is, has some major jinks to it. There's nothing quiet like tossing a car up in the air, it's gas tank, and ahniliating baddies. That's just fun. But when you're firing off your electric attacks, Cole becomes a slow moving sponge that is so eager to soak up the bullets. A really slow sponge. Good thing your health is based on draining any electric substance you can find. Transformers, telephone poles, car batteries, anything. Sucker Punch really went out on a limb with making electrical powers (lightning bolts, shock waves, even a lightning storm), each one fully upgradable depending on how you play the game.

 InFamous' karma system also has it's pluses and minus'. Each power you get can be upgraded differently depending on whether you play as a super hero cop or a electrical terrorist. Each base power can be upgraded so far out depending on what side you play, you have to play it twice just to see all the different goodies. The negative is that is when you show your true colours, the choices are so black and white, it's almost no fun. Should I kill the pedestrians kill an innocent man, or should I set him free? There's just no shades of grey. And none of the decisions have any impact in the story, just if you plan to play it good or evil.

 InFamous' core mechanics are fantastic and fun. Climbing and fighting have minor setbacks, but the good deffinitly outweights the bad. The story could use a good overhaul, but with all the good and bad powers you can choose from, InFamous is a game that needs to be played twice.

Although it is more enjoyable than the original game in the franchise. It wasn't anywhere near perfect, but still an enjoyable experience. It has the look and feel of GTA games, as well as other free roam games, except it's not *REALLY* free roam.

The game is very linear, you have one mission, and once you complete it you can move onto the next. Sure, you have a whole city to cruise around, but there's no side missions to discover, so ""Exploring"" is pointless. Although it is fun to just drive around, and listen to the radio, because the music in the game is FANTASTIC.

Despite the linear nature of the game, the storyline is pretty fantastic, and follows Vito through the 40's and 50's as he rises from an associate to a made man. You get to witness his rise and fall, and while he is a bad guy, you still care about him and can sympathize with the main character.

Once you finish the game, there's no real free roam though, but there IS the DLC, which to be honest are very poor. They don't play much like the main game, and are mainly text based missions, that are more action oriented and have stricter time limits. They only useful purpose of these DLC is to serve as a Freeroam, and just muck around with the poorly constructed missions. The DLC is included with the game free, so while they stink, it doesn't impact the main game in any way.","Good game, poor DLC",1385424000,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",
3.0,True,"06 8, 2014",AH0A0JH8S9YEU,B002DC8GKO,the gamer,"So I got this game cause well it was really cheap and I already knew why. It had a very big premise it seemed to convey back before it was being released. You could customize your character so thoroughly and such. It is a FPS and has a team fortress 2 feel to it while your playing. There are different groups you can choose such as a gunner, a mechanic, a medic, etc.

The plot is one of a FPS, if your into FPS games you won't really care probably. If your not the story won't really get you interested all that much.

I spent the first half an hour trying to design a character I wanted (unfortunately most of the stuff you want to use are locked until you unlock them during game so kinda loses the point at first, maybe a good way to reward players for playing but its such a mundane thing I feel its a waste to lock it at the beginning or have to unlock it during game play but whatever). Then got right into the story, which lasted about 2 minutes then it was time to start playing.

You basically have to capture or guard points in the maps (just like team fortress in a way) and thats pretty much as far as I could see happening. Each time you die (which seems to happen quite often) you just respawn after so many seconds and go back to fighting. The other thing is if you don't die you start to run out of ammo pretty easily and it seems easier to just get yourself killed then try to get more ammo.

The shooting aspects were kinda bad. I guess it was for PS3 so joystick controls do kinda stink for being very accurate. After a while I just got bored of the game though. Sorry I didn't finish it so my review can't be that accurate but when your bored playing a FPS game you know something is wrong. If I wanted to play team fortress 2 I would go play (for free I might add) team fortress 2 for PC (steam).

Pros:
1. Customization for characters and stuff
2. ... ah....
3...... um.. Kinda looks cool I guess?
4... I got nothin.

Cons:
1. Having to play a bit just to unlock a few things that are meaningless other then making your character look different.
2. The game kinda encourages you to get yourself killed (in that you run low on ammo and its easier to kill yourself and spawn with more ammo then to run around wasting time trying to get ammo from dead bodies or team mates)
3. Story is kinda blah. Didn't really pull me in all that much.
4. A team fortress 2 clone in a way.
5. Confusing at times on what/how your suppose to do something.
6. On PS3 the shooting aren't that accurate as they would be for a PC version and a mouse

I guess I should have tried to finish the game but it was just so boring that I lost interest in trying to keep playing. Some people who want a change in pace or a different type of FPS game might enjoy this game at least for a little while. Maybe someday ill get back into it and finish it but you never know.

Here's the main problem, i don't care about the characters.  It may just be me, but i'm also having a time following the story.  In ME3, your decision (supposedly) dictate the outcome of the game.  Here you make decisions, and can never be too sure what you did, or how it will affect you.

As I mentioned above, the game is based around a system of points called ""kudos"", which you earn for driving well.  Sliding your car and getting it on two wheels are examples of moves that earn kudos.  You compete in various events such as races, top speed challenges and overtaking challenges (see how many people you can pass in a given time).  Along the way you earn kudos, which unlocks more tracks and cars.  The challenges are varied enough to keep things interesting for a while.  And the promise of new cars and tracks serves as a good carrot and keeps you playing.
Although PGR is unique as far as racing games go, I found it just didn't hold my interest.  The tracks weren't nearly diverse enough and working toward new cars and tracks eventually lost its fun.
I also found the graphics to be a bit of a letdown.  The replays look very good, but half of that comes from the aggressive camera angles/motions that are used.  This makes it seem more like real TV, but it's just a camera trick.  To be fair, the renderings of the cars are very good, especially when you see reflections on them at night.

So far, it detects eyefinity (3x24"" at 3840x768) then...ouch...it looks like the characters suffered from advanced obesity...so FOV is not good.

The game play is fine although not as creative as Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber of Secrets and Azkaban games.  After the central game is done, you can still run around making points and finding the things you didn't accomplish during the game.

The main negatives, and they are major which interferes with the enjoyment of the game, is that instead of designing it to use the mouse to move Harry around, you have to use the keyboard (either the ASDW keys or the arrow keys) and then move your hands to the mouse to case spells.  You also cannot move Harry while casting a spell, he has to either cast a spell or move, which messes up being able to avoid being hit and/or aiming correctly.  To make a combat spell, you have to use the mouse but the hold down the right button, which after a very short time gets to be impossible since those fingers are the weakest but in order to win combat you have to keep using those fingers.  Combat was better when you used the mouse to aim and then the Ctrl key (or Alt key) to blast the spell (aka the first 3 games).  Also, some of the things you should be doing are NOT intuitive; when Fred & George are flying around the Grand Stairway, not sure if I was suppose to be doing anything since nothing I tried seemed to make a difference but that sequence was so long, I'm pretty sure I was supposed to be doing something.

If they could design the games using the keyboard less, since most people these days use a mouse or touchpad (or the equalent thereof) for moving the cursor around, that would improve gaming about 5000% and make it actually fun to play.  Trying to move Harry turned into a very frustrating experience and my Harry spent the whole game moving like he was either drunk or drugged.  I was also a little disappointed I couldn't cast spells on Hermione and Ron who often would get in the way.  It would also have been nice if they would allow the player to designate which keys did what (ala Azkaban).  I was also disappointed that I could not use my Logitech Precision gamepad.",Moving Harry a BIG problem in this game,1184716800,28,{'Platform:': ' PC'},
3.0,False,"12 21, 2013",A3G32CDOGAECMI,B00F4GSAYI,A Movie Fan,"While playing this game, you're given the choice of assassinating targets or eliminating them the ""moral"" ways.  The moral ways are absolutely disgusting and I have to wonder about the sanity of the people that wrote the script for this game.  Without going into spoilers (and anyone that wants spoilers can just google this), your choices are assassinate people or enslave and torture them until they die.  This is not the moral choice yet the game sets it up as the ""good"" way to deal with the people.  It's pretty sickening.

The actual game play is divided up into stealth or run and gun.  I'm not a stealth person so I played it as a shooter/sword fighter.  This worked fine and the fighting is significantly better than The Last of Us which I was playing concurrently with it.  While the game is set up to allow for stealth or non-stealth playthroughs, the game repeatedly tells you that you're going to get the ""bad ending"" if you kill people.  They're basically penalizing people that don't enjoy stealth despite the claim that you can play it how you want.

At the end of the day, this game is in no way a ""game of the year"".  It's average and the comparisons to Deus Ex are insulting because this is only marginally like it.  If you want to play a game that gives you choice, I highly recommend that.

The game length for the main game is very short, maybe 12 hours long on the first time through it, probably could be done in 4 hours if you skip the cut scenes.  Of course if you play it the stealth route, your timer will say you finish the game in 10 or 12 hours but you'll have spent two hundred hours reloading your saves a billion times and on top of that you wouldn't be able to use 90% of the gameplay mechanics because while they want you to play the game using stealth, you have very few options available for that type of play (almost every weapon and power is geared towards run and gun).",This game's moral choices are disgusting,1387584000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

In it you are hunting a renegade Russian general who supplied a fanatical jihadist with a nuke that he used to destroy a major Middle East city.  The mission takes place on the general's estate not far from Chernobyl.  Your character Soap is a British SAS accompanying some idiot on a sniper mission to kill the general.  You come to a large field and suddenly six battle tanks appear at the other end with an entire company of Russian Spetznatz walking in between the spread out tanks.  No matter where you go you are either discovered and killed by the Spetznatz or run over and turned to goo by the tanks.  I have tried this mission seven times and the effing game always says I am to blame for being discovered even when the numb nuts trainer is discovered first.

3.0,True,"10 22, 2012",A5NW620UKE9K,B0050SXLQC,DANN,"If you look at the review distribution, there are a lot of 5-star reviews and 1-star reviews, with not so much in the middle. I found this to be, however, a very mediocre game that is certainly not worthy of 5-stars but not deserving of a 1-star rating either. I think what you have here are die hard fans of the series either very disappointed (leading to the 1-star reviews) or vigorously defending the RE series (leading to the 5-star reviews).

I've read 50 plus reviews on here and waited until I finished the game before writing this review. I can tell you for a certainty that there are a lot of reviews on here that didn't play enough of the game to justify their review. For example, many people said in their review how you need to beat all 3 campaigns to unlock the Agent Hunt extra. Wrong. You only need to beat one campaign and the Agent Hunt option will unlock.

I beat both the Leon and Chris campaign and played about half of the Jake campaign before I got bored with the game and decided I'm done with it. And unlike RE4 and RE5 which I still have, I'm going to be selling back RE6 which at the time of this writing is already about $20 below the original release price. That's a pretty fast drop 3 weeks after release for an RE game! So clearly many people were disappointed with the game.

I liked the Leon campaign best which was surprising a little as I expected I would like the more action-oriented Chris campaign. But after the 1st chapter of the Leon campaign it was basically all action. What I liked better about the Leon campaign though was that it didn't seem to drag on like the Chris campaign did. The Chris campaign had way too much ""chasing Ada"" in it and felt very repetitive during Chapters 4 and 5.

Everyone has mentioned the overuse of the QTE's and I'm no exception. Hated it! Way too many. However, there were a few new things I did like. Like the new directional feature (the golden arrow accessed via the ""L-2"" button) to show the direction you need to travel, very good implementation for this game. Another cool implementation is being able to shoot while lying on your back - this came in handy several times during battle. However, like many others I too have found the new inventory control feature confusing, though after a few hours of playtime I did finally figure out how it works. I still like the old system better of carrying items in a suitcase, and RE4 did it best I think in that you could upgrade your suitcase to carry more items as the game progressed. However, I see what Capcom was trying to do here by allowing you to access all of your inventory during gameplay rather than having to wait until you finish gameplay and then have access to it. But the implementation of it is awkward and not user-friendly. The key I think is to leave a couple of slots available so that when a battle ensues you can pick-up specialty items like grenade launcher ammo for example, and not have to fumble with your inventory and delete things you don't need. So I think Capcom did make some improvements to this game over the previous RE games, though some of them (like the inventory system) were not well-implemented.

I think what I missed the most were the notes and journals that you could read and collect from RE4 or RE5 - to me this always added great value to the story. Now you are looking for and shooting blue stars that unlock parts of the story. But I think it makes much more sense to find these items and read them during the flow of the game. You should be uncovering these story aspects at the point in the story that it makes sense to learn about them, not an hour or hours later after you stop playing and go back to read what you found. But I know many people don't care about the storyline and just play for the action, which is probably why Capcom made this change. But for me, I replayed RE4 and RE5 just to gain the journals and notes so I could understand more parts of the story, but with RE6 I didn't even bother.

I also don't like the skill system - this is borrowed from several other action games where you can enhance skills and abilities of your character or the game play. I much prefer the old system of collecting money and upgrading my weapons with the money.

When I heard that there would be three campaigns with intertwined stories I thought it was going to be a really well-developed storyline, but what we got was boring, repetitive, and discombobulated. RE4 and RE5 I played on each of those for about one month. Replaying because I was interested in doing so. I played this game for 2 weekends and finished nearly all of it and have no desire to replay any of it.

I'm a huge fan of the original Wario land games expecilly the 1st on back on the original gameboy. I would say behind the Mario and sonic games there some of the best platformers ever made.

Shake it however just feels a little off for some reason. Theirs only a few enemy types, half of them can't even hurt you besides just getting in the way a little bit. The levels are designed well for exploration but theirs not many obstacles/pitfalls to stop you.  I believe its more or less aimed more towards younger gamers compared to the other Wario land games because it is really easy to beat the game. Now getting all the collectibles in this game is a different story as in all the Wario games its very challenging to get some of them and it will take moderate skill to 100% the game. Theres also a few wii remote functions you have to do like shaking treasure bags and throwing stuff to hit a object. It feels kinda gimicky but it could have been a lot worse so its not enough to hurt the game.

I will give this game some credit for the graphics. Its almost like playing a Saturday morning cartoon and I wish the would bring this style to make a 2d Mario or to bring it back on the next Wario land game whatever platform it may be. The only problem with the graphics is that during most of the game there's a large useless bar on both sides of the screen that pretty much restricts widescreen play with this game. The music isn't bad not the best I've heard from a Nintendo game but its not the worst either. There is a few good tracks here and there though. That's really all to say about the sound other than the occasional WARRRIOOOOOO sounds

In general I would say compared to other 2d or 3d platformers on the system (new mario bros, dk country returns) this one is a little bit of a step down but it is more relaxing so if you have played a lot of new Mario bros and dk country on the Wii and want something a little less stressful, if you want a game for your kids or a younger gamer  then I would recommend it if you can get it cheap.

They're two different products, Amazon.  Would you stick all disposable razor reviews together onto one page?  Because that makes about as much sense.

So my review for Adrenaline will appear at the end.  I gave it four stars.  My three stars are for an average of the two.  Maybe this was the only way to artificially inflate the final rating so anyone would give Play for Real a second look.

Because Play for Real absolutely sucks.  Games like this are the reason people hate Kinect.  Clunky, inconsistent motion recognition.  Pointless mini games that seem to only be trying to showcase the miracle of controlling a video game with your body, ignoring whether it's fun to do so or not.  And interminable loading screens and menus to swipe through.  Play for two minutes, stand still selecting stuff and waiting for four.  The only activity I thought was worth a replay was hang gliding, and even that ticked me off when I kept failing because the game wouldn't respond to my motion.  I am perhaps more forgiving than most when it comes to Kinect games, but boy, do I regret trying this one.

MotionSports Adrenaline, on the other hand:

I bought this on impulse to have something to play with my friend.  To my surprise, it has become one of my top three favorites.  It's not perfect -- you don't get to use your avatar, and motion tracking/animation isn't nearly as smooth as in other games.  Also the menus are extremely sensitive and it's hard to avoid choosing the wrong thing.  After every event you unlock special suits, rewards, and new tracks, but it's hard to care about them if your own avatar isn't involved.

The rock climbing activity is a complete waste of time -- I can't even figure out how to make the character move, let alone move to where I want it.  Kite surfing was better but failed to keep our attention.

The best games in here are without a doubt wing suit, mountain biking, kayaking and skiing.  Skiing in particular absolutely took my breath away -- it's practically worth the purchase price alone.

I've only begun playing, but it seems like the number of courses for each event is way too few.  Last night I did purchase the Urban Jungle add-on and I'm excited to see what that brings to the game, but I can see the possibility of becoming bored eventually once I've memorized all the tracks.  Still, for what I got it for (used at local store), it's well worth the money.

Edit:  The Urban Jungle add-on, as far as I can see, only added a single course to a few events.  Not sure if it's worth the extra dough.  Also, if anyone else like me noticed parkour and trampoline advertised, not true.  I suspect those were mentioned in pre-release notes and none of the sites that reviewed early versions bothered to update.  Ubisoft themselves confirmed they don't exist.

Mainly because the difficulty curve went beserk and would make you think such a thing as a ""difficulty curve"" was just a figment of your imagination and never existed in the first place. I was un-able to even get passed the first zone because of the ""dodgeball"" boss, dodging has never been my strong suit in gaming.

The game play is straightforward enough - seat and serve customers of several colors, get extra points for seating same customers in same colored seats; bonus points mount for 'chaining' or repeating the same action multiple times in a row. Seat, take order, bring food, bring check, clear table. There are a few more twists, but that's the general idea.

Once I got the hang of the game I found I could blow right through it. As the levels progress the only variety was in the patience level, color and volume of the customers - it gradually becomes more challenging but it also becomes repetitive. Another negative is that when you replay a level you are presented with exactly the same customers in exactly the same order lessening replay value somewhat.

I have played Diner Dash all the way through twice. I think that the game is replayable if you wait long enough between plays.

It freezes every hour or so, and there is way too much incentive to just slam into people, because the hosts are always set to """"no damage"". This makes multiplayer a boring smash-fest where heavier cars (that would blow their radiator in most of these instances, to say the least) and sometimes FWDs hyped up with driver aids take all the slower-class races. You have to be skilled already to get through a single race without getting butt-rammed, and most races will have a pile-up by corner 1.
 Many cars are default setup to understeer badly, including the mid-engine sports cars. When you have to dial out lots of track-exiting understeer from a F40 or a GT3RS then something is wrong. I know it's not much of a simulator, but this is ridiculous.
 And the menus are slooooow - lacking logic('view cars by class' for example - takes about 4 ~different~ button pushes when 1 or 2 would have been wise), nor a cancel/opt-out: where it makes you wait a minute and then get dumped into a track you might have selected by accident.
 Also, still no 'track day' mode where you select ONE track but can bring MULTIPLE CARS, so you don't have to reload the track just because you want to drive a different car in freeplay. That one wastes COUNTLESS hours for me, grrrr.
 Also, some cars I was hoping for are not in the game, or cost extra=($):  Porsche($) (a HUGE letdown as they are available for every other Forza and we were told pre-release that they WOULD be here but they aren't, and the only rear-engine car in the game now is a Renault Alpine), new NSX, new GT350R and FocusRS($), Ferrari 488GTB & FXXK($), BMW i8, GT-R nismo, McLaren 570S($) & 675LT, Boss 309, any recent N/A road-going Corvettes(at least let us remove the blower), AP1 Honda S2000.
Still has DLC cars - I already bought the game, you greedy jerk-wads - now just let me play it. It's like you see a car you'd like to try out, and instead of getting to play it in the game, INSTEAD it's ""oh no you don't, gotta cough up more dosh to do that, SUCKER""
Love all the Alfas and Fords, though. Some of those cars are a real treat.
Hate the SUVs and vans - just cheap-laugh crap that has no business being in a circuit racing game at all. Just kills any feel of realism when a van with center-of-gravity 3 feet higher than your car and horrible aero is ""tuned to class"" and wins races. Funny for a bit, but for a game that tries to sell itself on realistic gameplay this is just plain dumb.

My only complaint is that I think it's stupid that we need to power off the entire machine anytime we do anything or change a setting on the Nintendo instead of just being able to restart it or something.

For starters I love how the headset looks. I like the fact that the boom mic is on the inside and is retractable. I like the fact that the headset is rechargeable and comes with the batteries. As far as sound quality, its pretty good but its not a great as I would have hoped it would be. It doesn't have the white noise that has plagued the Turtle Beach wireless headsets but what bothers me is the sound is distant, even turned all the way up. With the my X41's the sound was right there, in my head but with the Chimaera it does not sound like you have speakers right next to your ears. I messed with several settings and none to my liking. Also I found myself having to re-sync the headset a couple of times...on the first day. The headset itself is real snug and comfortable, on my 8 year old. Unless you have a small head these will feel tight and uncomfortable after a few minutes of gaming or watching a movie and they don't flex much. For that reason alone I am returning these and shelling out the extra cash for the XP 500's. Sound quality to me is #1 and comfort is right there with it, this headset failed to provide either one of those things. I really wanted to like them. If only they felt as comfortable as they looked and sounded as good as they are advertised on paper. Maybe their next gen will be improved but until then I have to stick with TB.

I almost forgot to mention but the mic is extremely sensitive. It picks up even the lowest of sounds from clear across the room and I had several gamers complaining that I was too loud.

What we have here is the problem with most PSP titles. similar to the problem i had with Metal Gear Solid Potable Ops (which was pretty good), this game is not a real Tales game. Its just a spin off that has almost all the elements such as graphics and characters but departs from the classic gameplay we already enjoy by taking away solid story and classic gameply fun. Its feels more like a title forced into the series, holding the Tales name only to make money.

The great points of the game are the graphics, alot of the game has voiceovers and characters from other tales games make appearences. you can customize your character in armor and weapons, The battle system is good, The load times aren't too bad and the game runs smooth. Just about everything from the classic titles are here, right? Unfortunately thats not the case. Just like most PSP titles, it has great features but other major elements are left out leaving another bland title.

STORY!! is it so hard?? when i started the game, i thought it to have a good base and story and even after 2hrs of gameplay, i still thought it OK but after 6hrs of gameplay, what had I done?? quests... ALOT of POINTLESS quests all to get in to some stupid club of warriors which seems to have no significance to the real backstory which isn't really all that great to begin with. I had only seen three  different areas, the town, a dungeon and another dungeon... you go to the town, get a quest, go to one of the 2 dungeons, then return and get another quest... the game falls short of remaining fresh and fun. after 6 long hours of gameplay, i had no desire to continue at all.

As a huge fan of the movies, I've never been quite sure how to feel about these Godfather games.  They're such weird animals, based loosely on the movies but not really inhabiting the same world, what with all the swearing and bright colors.  They feel more like 'Goodfellas' the game rather than 'The Godfather'.  Not that one is better than the other, but 'Goodfellas' was much more visceral, casually violent and coarse; and that's where these games seem to come from.  And they go so far out of their way to 'expand' on the story to shoe-horn in this super-gangster you play as: did the Godfather realy need MORE plot?  Also, HA!  Did you see the fake Michael Corleone they had to use because they couldn't get the rights to Al Pacino's face?  More like Al Paci-NO!  ...huh?  Or, Michael NO-leone!  ...maybe?

Anyway, the story is awkward and 'expands' upon what was already a great story in ways that just cheapen it and make it... stupid.  The Corleone family starts to come across as some kind of para-military organization as opposed to, you know... criminals.  None of it works.  Still, I appreciate the attempt to get as many of the original actors as possible to do some voice acting for it.  That was pretty cool to hear.

But the gameplay, despite my moaning about the story, isn't too bad.  Shooting and brawling are both fun if occasionally flawed, and there's the beginnings of some nice variety when it's time to assault your enemies compounds.  You've got your different varieties of italian stereotype sidekicks to choose from, with different specialties and abilities (demolitions, lockpicking, electrician, what-have-you), so there's some strategy involved in making sure you try to have the right guy for the right job.  As the game progresses and you 'promote' guys within your crime-family, they can take on secondary and tertiary skill sets, making certain members true assets.  One of the more enjoyable parts for me was building up my crew into a formidable fighting force and promoting and enhaching guys I felt had been the most ""reliable"" (i.e. shoot bad-guys good).

The three cities you visit (New York, Miami, and Havana) are decent to run around in but always wind up feeling a little flat and a little small (though I might just be spoiled by the GTA series at this point).  Grinding down the other crime families, taking their properties and assasinating their leaders, is fun and rewarding if repetitive.  You can sabotage their businesses to take away certain bonuses (bullet-proof vests and stuff) but none of it is too difficult, so you might as well just take the whole building rather than waste time planting bombs and cutting wires.  You can send your crew to do it for you, but they're not always reliable on their own and will wind up shot down more times than not.  There are side-quests to get small bonuses and banks to rob, but overall there isn't much variety.  And once you've done something once in this game, there's very little reason or incentive to do it again.

In the end, it's a decent play'n'forget title (so long as you're not a purist about the films).  It doesn't ask you to get too invested, which is good, because you wont.  Nothing groundbreaking, nothing terribly interesting.  The weak story isn't overly-detrimental and could easily have been overcome by strong game-play.  But form matched function in this one and mediocrity abounds.

Still, there's some CGI boobs.  Not great ones, but that's still better than NO boobs, right?  Right?

I had a cable modem and very fast graphics card, as well as a 1.5 Ghz CPU with 512MB of memory. All these things couldn't make ShadowBane run any faster, its graphics delays tolerable... if you can handle waiting for them to better streamline its performance, go ahead and try it. If you'd rather not be one of the ""paying beta testers"" after its initial release, wait and check the boards to see how the loading delays and lag issues are coming along.",Delays everywhere you go,1048464000,8,,

No matter if you have just started the game or are well into it, the difficulty level doesn't seem to vary too much. For me, it is way too easy and that really let's the game down. Another drawback is the fact that there are only four types of courses (Alpine, Mediterranean, Parkland and Tropics) Of course, each one is quite large but it still limits the players' choice severely.

Unlike earlier NFS games, there are also no varying weather conditions i.e. rain or snow, nor nighttime driving, which is a let down.

The design obviously hinges on Kinect usage, with the user vocally calling out ""Netflix"" or ""Hulu"" and the remote takes over and an alternative for the joypad as far as UI navigation.

The only positive the remote has are specific buttons to control media playback (play/pause, fast forward, etc.)

The biggest negative is the remote requires direct line of sight with the console, specifically the remote has to line up with the disk drive (point of reference example.) the remote can NOT communicate via Kinect and won't register unless it has an absolute direct line the the ""face"" of the main console (angle of attack tolerance is extremely limited.)

A glaring oversight with the remote is when you compare the Xbox to the most comparable competing media device. VCR's also have TV pass-through, their remotes...even ones sold after the fact, have number pads to facilitate channel changing in Television mode. On top of that VCR remotes tend to have a button that can toggle between the VCR's UI and TV broadcast without manually going through a UI to change video source. With all the TV integration hype these features are glaringly absent from this media remote, the loss of Kinect as a mandatory interface just enhances the lack of those interfaces on the XB1 Media remote

3.0,False,"03 24, 2005",A169I83JL8QJGN,B0007TFLLC,Daniel A Moir,"I'm a cross platformer, and I've been looking forward to the PSP for a good long time. I've been long awaiting a handheld with enormous next-generation graphics, and game play. Thus far the PSP has fallen flat on its face in terms of the latter. As far as the former goes, anyone whose played Metroid Hunters can attest that the DS is still a capable piece of hardware, and while the system may not be quite as powerful it is capable of high quality products, and the difference between the DS and the PSP is marginal.
 But ultimately it comes down to the games. Now mind you, I am not biased. I do love Nintendo (although I fully admit the N64 was a stinker), and I do have hard feelings toward the PS2 because I feel the over all system is a huge let down, but I also love my Xbox, and I have ALL of the major consoles, and I do plan to continue that tradition. But this leaves me with no reason or need for bias. I have all the systems, so I can make up my own mind about what I like and have no need to go on a jealous ""I bought x system so y systems stinks"" rant. I let game play be the judge. And so far the PSP will gratify sport fans immensely... and no one else. Ape escape is a let down, Metal Gear Acid is a severe let down, and Dark Stalkers is a let down... The PSP literally launched with nothing for casual, hardcore, or budget gamers. Only sport fans. Seriously, look at the line up this far.
 Now the DS library has been building up slowly, I admit that. But there's now 5 games I consider must haves for it, and that's better than the PS2 did in its first year on my shelf. The PSP seems to be repeating the launch pattern of the PS2, all sports, and nothing else of value, and as you can tell, I am not a sports fan.
 Also consider that Square-Enix's handheld support will be dominantly Nintendo, starting with the never before domestically released Final Fantasy III, and an update to the Egg Monster and Crystal Chronicles series, as well as a new Mana game. PSP so far has ONE Square-Enix game planned, a follow up to FFVII, exciting, sure, but not as exciting as the longer list of DS planned titles.
 I think if we should have learned anything this last generation and the generation before it is that graphics do not matter, it's the game play. The N64 was much more powerful than the PS1 (although the cartridge format restricted FMV capabilities) but the Playstationites were quite content with their pixilated, aliased, low-resolution, and low-polygon count games. The PS1 was where most of last generation's great games were... this round Xbox and Gamecube have clobbered the PS2 in game play, and especially graphics (RE4 and Halo 2 anyone?) but the PS2 is still out selling both systems. Graphics and system power are invalid arguments.
 Also consider that the PSP is a whopping $250.00. That's an awful lot for a handheld, especially with Microsoft's successor to the Xbox looming on the horizon. Remember that the N-Gage was quite a capable piece of hardware by comparison to the GBA as well... because of its price it bombed, and now, even though Nokia is practically giving it away now most stores are no longer carrying it, and have no plans to carry the next one. I'm not saying PSP will suffer the same fate, in fact I hope the PSP does well, it has enormous potential... but really I would recommend waiting for two things before you buy it. 1) A price drop by about $50. Give the system 6 months, it will happen, and 2) unless you're a huge sports fan you'll find yourself pretty board with PSP pretty quickly. So wait for the AAA must have titles to appear. The system will be a paperweight for 6 months plus if you don't. I'm already shelving mine until something noteworthy comes out (most likely the aforementioned Square-Enix game.) Where as with my DS, even if the DS line up isn't the most intuitive, or brilliant of all time it's building, and has some incredible just-around-the-corner games that are must haves. Mario Kart DS (Fully online capable) Animal Crossing DS (again fully online capable) Castlevania DS (AKA Aria of Sorrow 2, tentatively) and numerous other groundbreaking titles that will definitely make DS owners happy. I'm looking at the release list for the PSP... more sport games... Where's the innovation? Where's the variety? Well, truth be told my PS2 took a year and a half well after the Xbox and Gamecube were added to my shelf, to get some really noteworthy games. Sadly I anticipate the same fate will befall the PSP. I just hope I'm wrong, but not being a sport fan, so far it doesn't look good for PSP. Sure it's more powerful, but by no means is it more fun than my DS, and therefore it is not better. Technologically perhaps, but certainly not by means of innovation or great games.
 As far as UMD movies? Sorry, I have a portable DVD player, and I support the DVD format fully. I have no intention of buying the same movie on two different formats just so I can watch a movie on my PSP. Music, however, may cause me to take my PSP out of the closet it's already been cast into... except I also have a portable CD player... MP3s are more convenient sure, but I don't have the money to blow on a memory stick sizable enough to make it worthwhile. I just bought the PSP after all... Oh well.
 In conclusion, wait and see with PSP. Sure it's got marginally prettier graphics than the DS, but unless you're a sports fan or a die-hard Sony fan boy right now there's absolutely nothing to justify the purchase of this handheld. We'll see what the future brings, though. On technology merits alone I give it 3 stars.

Graphics.
Awesome! the environments you explore are completely differing worlds from the original games with the exception of Destiny Islands and a completely different version of Radiant garden. Althought I never thought a handheld system could contain such realistic graphics I was proven wrong once again.

Battle system.

A little hard to master but not nearly as agrivating as 358/2 Days. You can buy or earn a variety of attack options  that you equip into a deck. Sometimes actions can be fused to create cool new attacks and the attacks increase in power when you level up. The only bummer is that one of the actions that must  be equipped is your cure spells. I always liked that when it
 was automatic.

Keyblades

Here is where the problems start. There is absolutely no variety!!! no matter which story you play, you all earn the same keyblades!!!. The only ones that can't be earned by the other characters are the ones you start with. LAME!!  they donn't even look cool either.

Characters

Lost this game a star. Terra is the most IDIOTIC, GULLIBLE poor excuse for a KH Character I have ever seen. EVER!!! Just play and you'll see what I mean.

Aqua: Reffering to someone as ""This boy"" or ""This girl"" when they're standing right in front of you and constantly spouting your personal thoughts about  is not normal. It  made me wonder how long her trip to La-La land was going to last.

Ventus:OH COME ON!! they couldn't at least try and come up with an original character? its a rip off iof Roxas. they didn't even change the voice actor.

The idiotic main characters are somewhat made up for by the fact you get to see many of the KH one or two characters when they were young and learn the true identities of our black-cloaked friends. That alone made up for the idiotic mains.  Its amazing and anwers so many questions.

However, Tales of Xillia 2 perhaps embodies this phrase more than any other video game sequel that has ever been made. This is a game for people that loved Tales of Xillia, and nobody else. It looks the same, sounds the same, and contains the same strengths and weaknesses that the first game had, often to its own detriment. Yet despite the incredible amount of similarities that this sequel shares with its predecessor, it ultimately ends up feeling distinct, especially when it comes to the intense, and much darker, storyline.

In my review of the first Tales of Xillia, I stated that the only thing that kept me from giving the game a 5 star review was the game's environments, particularly the dungeon and overworld settings. They seemed like they were made in a hurry. They didn't look very good, didn't really display much creativity in terms of level design, and really weren't all that fun to explore. Well, as Tales of Xillia 2 takes place in the same world as the first game, almost all the assets from the first game are reused here, and you'll end up running through the same areas, listening to the same music (which isn't a bad thing, as the music is great), and finding secrets in the same places. That's what made Tales of Xillia 2 drag at times. As these environments weren't too stellar the first time around, having to go through them all again here can be downright grating sometimes. As a result, I spent significantly less time exploring this time around, and primarily stuck to story missions and character side quests. There are a handful of new locales, but this game's biggest weakness is the recycling of environments that weren't all that great the first time around. Rounding this issue out is the game's final area, one of the only new environments in the game, and an exercise in frustration due to its trial and error way of moving forward towards the final battle. It seemed like a cheap way to pad out the final sequence of the game, and ended up being more annoying then fun.

One of Tales of Xillia's major strengths was its gameplay and combat, and that returns here with some changes that will please some and disappoint others. Your main character can now rotate between different weapon sets, each with its own full arsenal of artes (the game's magical attacks), making combat more dynamic than it was the first time. Certain enemies are weak to certain weapons and resistant to others, and the weapon transitions can be lot of fun to play with. Yet at the same time, it can get to the point where there are TOO many artes, especially later on in the game when your character is at a high level. For some players, it will become very difficult to master a particular combat style, particularly when trying to maximize linked artes with your party members. These battle system refinements are a mixed bag, and depending on who you are, will either feel like an improvement or a step down. Also, your character has a sort of beast mode phase where he can shift into the form of a dark being and wield enormous powers once a certain gauge is filled. The character leveling system is also more refined and felt like less of a hassle to use. Overall, the changes in gameplay are small, but feel just significant enough to stay fresh.

Ultimately, though, just like the first game, Tales of Xillia 2's greatest strength lies in its characters, its writing, and its story, all which return here with a vengeance. These strengths are why the player is going to want to play Tales of Xillia 2 after completing the first game, and that desire is absolutely warranted. The main story is told in a significantly different way than the first game was. The main character, Ludger, is a mostly-silent protagonist, and was created this way to give the player-choice driven narrative a more personal feel for the player. Taking a queue from a Bioware RPG, the gamer will constantly be making dialogue and action choices, some small and some quite large, that will affect not only the narrative, but also how his companions view him. Party member-specific side quests exist to strengthen Ludger's relationship (known as affinity) with his party members, which has benefits both in the storytelling as well as in the combat. And as for the story itself...it is stellar. It's a much darker, more personal story than Tales of Xillia's, yet is equally as poignant, especially in the end. The game's narrative often feels similar to playing the Playstation 2 classic Shadow of the Colossus, where the player will be forced to perform sometimes hideous deeds, and and in turn will begin to question their own motivations. It can be a rough ride emotionally, but this is ultimately very much a positive quality of Tales of Xillia 2, and it is what makes this game very much worth playing, despite its numerous weaknesses.

I would definitely recommend this title to fans of the first game who want more time with these characters and want to experience another top tier story in this universe. However, while this is still a solid game with a great story, it is not as strong as the first game due to its over-reliance on the first game's assets, and arguably its broader, yet less refined, battle system. This is a game for Tales of Xillia's biggest fans only.","""More of the same"" has never been more applicable",1425427200,,{'Style:': ' Standard Edition'},

The first thing you'll notice with Heritage of War is the super-limited edition packaging that features a book of the game's art and a CD of the game's music as well.  Behind all the extras though, not much has changed since the last time we saw a Growlanser game.  If you're a veteran of the series, you'll feel right at home, but for newcomers, prepare to feel out of the loop.  Heritage of War features an overaching story that transpires over the game's massively lengthy quest (along with some side quests to boot), but getting through all of it without getting turned off by the game's shortcomings is by far the greatest challenge Heritage of War has to offer.  There are graphical glitches and clipping issues aplenty, with some poorly animated character models and collision detection problems as well.  The game's story also isn't half as epic (or good) as it thinks it is, and features just about every cliche RPG story element you can think of.  While there is a lot against Heritage of War, it's not without it's plusses either.  Despite the horrible dialogue, there is some solid voice acting to be heard, not to mention some excellent music as well.  The game's real time battle system is also a blast to play once you get the hang of it, and many of the backgrounds and areas are nicely designed.  However, once you get past the massive length of Heritage of War, you'll have no reason to go back again.  There's nothing really all that compelling that you'll find here, but you could certainly do worse RPG wise.  All in all, Growlanser: Heritage of War is worth a look for fans of the series and RPG nuts alike, but let it be known to proceed with caution.",Nothing special,1192492800,19,,

The left one seems alright but the right one isn't nearly as responsive. I use this controller to play rocket league, and for whatever reason the right trigger (my accelerator) does not seem to be full power, unless I'm literally jamming my finger into it with an uncomfortable amount of force. The triggers are buttons, rather than traditional triggers that move on a pivot point, although they seem to be pressure sensitive as well. The design just doesn't do it for me. I want one or the other; with this controller they tried to find some common ground in the middle and it just doesn't work well for my applications. The D-pad however, is outstanding on this controller; it's the only reason this is getting 3 stars. I'm not going to bother returning it partly because of the hassle, but also because I can use this controller with emulators, because of the outstanding D-pad.

That man is Kane, his newly-appointed partner is Lynch. They are both class-A scumbags, and they have to work together despite the fact that there's no love or mutual respect for each other. What follows is a strictly linear traipse through many different environments ranging from bank vaults to Japanese night clubs. You'll kill many people and pick up lots of different guns...but how much fun will you have (if you pardon the macabre use of the world ""fun"")?

The answer is some, but not as much as you'd like. The weapons are all pretty much the same with a terrible targeting system. Precision targeting is almost non-existent in this game and hit detection is all over the place. The ability to take cover behind walls, pillars, etc. is very faulty and works only half the time. Some scenes are also too dark to make out what's going on.

There's plenty of swearing, and the voice acting is quite good. Jesper Kyd's gloomy score sets the tone perfectly. This is not an upbeat, cheery game. It's about ugly violence and grim revenge. For this reason alone very much earns its 18/M-rating. The presentation of this violence however is not that graphic, literally. The graphics are of PS2 quality. They may be in 1080p high-def but they look real bad.

I hear a sequel is in the works. More freedom to roam and an ability to upgrade Kane and Lynch as characters would be a welcome addition. Better graphics would be appreciated too. Above all, the guns and targeting need to be improved. Kane & Lynch makes for a decent bargain bin game, but don't pay top dollar for it.

It works really well with a good car to drive - one that has good handling.
The instructions I got in the box had little about using the wheel.

Tips:
Remember to Power on the Xbox One from the Console Button and not the controller button.
The Left Red Engine Start Button (D-PAD) is the Joystick to move the cursor on screen.
The Right Red Race Knob is turned to Select the Map/Menu.
The Y Button Selects the desired Car View from the drivers seat.

With these tips you can control Forza Horizon without the standard controller.

If you know how to drive a car, the wheel and pedals can only help your times on the road.

3.0,True,"03 10, 2014",A2FRG1RW35UFUX,B0013EF17O,Josh F.,"My wife and I love racing games!  We, of course, love all of the Mario-Kart games.  We also really, really like Little Big Planet racing (for PS-3) and we have enjoyed Sonic and Sega All-Starts (on the Wii).  This game though, for us, didn't/hasn't/isn't hooked us as much as those games.

Control: (3 out of 5 stars) To drive, you have to hold the Wii-mote horizontal (you can use the steering wheel accessory) and you steer by tilting the controller.  This is one of the steering options in Mario-Kart Wii and, while novel and fun, I personally prefer other steering options (like the nunchuk-Wii mote combo) and would have appreciated other options for this game.  That said, I felt like the turning was a little difficult to master and the response time was slow. It is hard to fall of the track but I wish I felt a little more connected to the car when I moved the Wii-mote.

Racing: (4 out of 5 stars) Racing is fun and there is a lot to learn.  One of the unique features of the game is Car-Fu, or using your car to dodge attacks and to attack other racers.  If you've seen the movie, you know that spinning, taking people out, jumping and a handful of other car tricks are used to win races and it is no different in this game.  By flicking the Wii-mote up and down or left and right you can dodge opponents or knock them out of the way, spin them out or blow them up.  While the concept is new and learning the attacks is fun, I found that the controller (more often than not) took my movements as turn commands and I ended up sending my car into spin-outs or jumps rather than dash left or right.  I'm sure with more practice I'll get the hang of it, but in most racing games (Wii and PS-3) I don't have any difficulty executing moves.

Graphics: (3 out of 5 stars) I know this is a Wii game, but it is difficult to discern power ups and speed ups on the course.  A lot of the courses have very colorful roads and while the power ups look different, they do tend to blend in, especially when you are driving super-fast (like from a speed boost).  Also, the other cars, being colorful themselves, are hard to distinguish from the background, making it very difficult to dodge them or spin them out.  It is especially hard to know when cars are coming up from behind and, since a lot of the game depends on your ability to use your car as the weapon, it is difficult to execute attacks and dodge other racers who come from behind.

Overall: (3 out of 5 stars) My wife and I will keep playing Speed Racer, but I don't think it will hold our interest for very long. We usually get hooked to a racing game and play through the story mode, battle challenges and do our best to complete the game all the way.  I don't think we'll do that with this one and will instead move on to something else I'm sure (Sonic and Sega All-Stars Transformed probably).",Just OK,1394409600,,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii'},

The back of the box says you are trying to build a phone to call home. OK, that is fine. I have never seen anything that resembles part of a phone in this game, just dots and indescribable objects. What you do is run around on the world map while avoiding holes that even if you get nowhere near them, you still fall in. Every step you take, your energy goes down by one. Every time you are in a hole fly out of it, your energy drains faster plus one per second you do not move. When the counter reaches zero, you ""die"", but a mailman (I guess is the boy from the movie) vibrates on you and you get 1/2 your life back and continue. You need to avoid police officers (I am guessing that is what they are), or they carry you to jail and you lose your dots sometimes. The same goes with the items you find. Never once have I completed the game, nor can I really tell if I did or not. So those are the rules of the game. There seems to be no penalty for ""dying"", being sent to jail, or doing anything wrong. You literally just wonder around aimlessly in a map with no consistency or reason until you get bored.

What does this have to do with the movie? Well, I read the back of the tape box and saw that yes, ET wants to build a phone to call home, so technically, I guess it does follow the movie in that regard, so there is no penalty for not following the movie at all like for example, Charlie's Angels. The thing that kills this game so much is the high confusion on what you are looking at, how dreadful the navigation is, and what exactly you are supposed to be doing. All this has to do with the fact that the game was programmed in 5 weeks (some say 6 weeks) and 5 million copies were printed right after with zero testing. The gameplay is extremely confusing and there seems to be no distinction to any human if there is actual progression taking place as you play.

The bottom line, this game is a terrible mess, but keep in mind, it is impossible to make a good game in a short time. This game is a very important piece in gaming history. It shows what happens when you rush a game like this and what happens when the market is flooded with bad games. This game is said to have single-handedly cause the famous videogame market crash of 1983 and over one million copies were buried in New Mexico shortly after release.

Something interesting is that this game released in 1982, caused the game market crash in 1983, yet I have a copy that was printed in 1986. See this item's pictures to see what I mean. But here are the differences that I saw:

The main two villains in this game are Black Mask and the Joker.  However, there are many twists that I don't feel like giving away in a simple review.  Needless to say, being there for the very first time Batman and Joker lay eyes on each other is a special moment for any comic book fan.

In this game, there is a bounty on Batman's head by Black Mask.  This brings out a whole slew of assassins from Killer Croc to Deathstroke.  As if being careful not to run into any assassins wasn't stressful enough on the Dark Knight, he also has to fight the police in this game as he is seen as a criminal vigilante.

First, I'd like to start by dividing my review into two factions.
1) The game itself
2) My personal detective work.

* PART 1 *

PLOT: Sent as an undercover agent to one of the best cities in Italy, Nancy gets a chance to crack open a theft ring in which artwork is stolen under direct surveillance  left & right!  I am not too intrigued with spy-like  adventures [more of a horror buff], but I was willing to put aside my  biases and tackle this adventure full-on!

INITIAL SCORE: 82

CHARACTERS:

Colin Baxter : An English  art restorer that has a self-serving infatuation with Nancy. He is loose in temperament and was the #1 suspect according to my gut feeling.  All the while ""Justin"" was working at  Ca' Nascosta, I wondered when he would break away and start stealing.

Margherita Faubourg  : Attempting to frolic among the elite in Venetian social status, this widow casts sarcastic remarks to Nancy the whole time, such as pointed barbs about her limited wardrobe and the ridiculousness of her boyfriends token locket.  I didn't have much respect for her, because all she did was tan on her roof, but I did play my part humbly as I was undercover.

Helena Berg : I had an affection for her as one does about an older gal still holding her own in the crux of current society.  With her  journalism profession, I wanted to learn what information she held and what leads she felt she could offer me about the thief.

Enrico Tazza  : I actually liked dealing with this head of an organized crime ring. He forced me to play a card game Scopa [which I loved] and sent me on an interesting mission to collect a sapphire jewel in order to gain trust.

CUMUL SCORE: - 2 = 80

SCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:
I actually find the ""beauty"" of Venice not that appealing at all. I see a lot of old boats floating along in dirty water with warped, stylized houses that are slowly deteriorating.  I don't mean to be cruel, but I didn't exactly get it. I love HERs' authenticity on presenting the city in its' actual state.  The voiceovers of Prudence Rutherford and the gondola singers were simply horrible. I understand that this may have been included for comic effect, but it doesn't really work. It sounds as if Mrs. Doubtfire [or someone in drag] was my contact and it threw off the focus of the plot line. They should have hired professionals singers also.

CUMUL SCORE: - 2 = 78

PUZZLES/MINI-GAMES: Scopa, right now, is one of the top two mini-games that HER has ever produced. I love that they included well-informed instructions for one to learn the culture of this iconic game. Right there the game enhances its replay value. The card game were so addicting that it actually overshadowed extreme fallouts to the final two excruciating dilemmas at the end of the story. The water tunnel puzzle was unnecessarily difficult without any reasoning on how one were to  solve it. The timed valve puzzle gave the gamer NO room for error and, without a walkthrough, you may have failed 15+ times easily....totally unreasonable. HER should have given the gamer at least three minutes to solve this. The chess notation game wasn't even understood, nor fun. Without a cheat, I daresay it was impossible to discover the answer within a few days. The dancing contest bothered some people, but I actually thought it was okay.  Different and unusual to be sure.

CUMUL SCORE: Even = 78

ADVENTURE ENDING: I was correct on the general idea of who the thieves were. Capturing the actual leader was done in literally 10 seconds and that was the highlight of my detective game.  I still think there was a lot of loose explanations that never wrapped up the elements of the story for me. I suppose I had to just enjoy the pleasure of the culprits being apprehended.  I loved learning the Italian dialogue [I took it one year in college btw] and how this material would benefit the average gamer in constructive education.

CUMUL SCORE: + 2 = 80

* PART 2 *

I try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to
take weeks! Well, it took me three days [10 hours] and I gave myself a
Detective Score Of : 63

My Strong Points: I never got held up in frustration at any main part of the adventure and I was quick to finish up the most important tasks of the game by being poignant with my mental machinery. ha, ha

My Weak Points: I did need a lot of clues to help kickstart linear exploits I found myself  limited in. I felt I was forced to use the walkthrough because the timed puzzles and confusing navigation of my character bogged me down.  I would gladly admit to cheating, because I saved literally five hours of endless circle-running otherwise.

OVERALL GAME SCORE: 80 + 63/ 2 = 71.5 [ B - ]

BOTTOMLINE:  This game was actually better than I expected, but I didn't feel I was as engaged as I was supposed to be. I think the characters really bothered me from a bonding standpoint. ha, ha

Never played an Uncharted game before, but I have constantly heard good things about the series. If this game is any indication of how good the mainline series is, I will definitely have to check it out.

Drake is very smart mouthed, but charming. He thinks his way out of problems and chooses the path of least resistance. Lots of fun dialog between Nathan and the other cast members. There are a few times I recall laughing aloud at his comments. ""I think I can see my house from here"" as he traverses a steep cliff side.

Graphics are very impressive for the Vita. Possibly the best example of what the device was capable of. Granted this was almost four years ago and most smart phones can do more complex stuff now.

So what didn't I like about the game?

A lot of the game forces you into these invisible corridors. There is hardly any exploration off the path the developers want you to follow. You think you can hop on a broken pillar or crawl into a hole, but nope. Just nice decorations and eye candy.

My main gripe is every touch control in the game is basically a gimmick. They were created to justify the existence of touch on the Vita. They offer you this asinine touch scheme, but 50% of the time you can ignore it and just use the joysticks. Here are some examples:

Climb a rope by swiping your fingers up the back track pad OR just the joystick
Climb a rock face by touching the footholds OR just use the joystick
Aim your gun by using the gyro in the vita OR just use the joystick

You absolutely have to use the touchpad for puzzles, grenade use, and QTE. No way around those. The only time the Vita had a unique and interesting control was when you use an external light on the back track pad to reveal a map on parchment paper. The coolest thing and you only do it one time.

Now since touch scheme is so unfortunately ingrained into the game, this game is NOT PS TV compatible. Which is a total shame since it would have looked nice on a bigger screen. All those gimmicky touch controls ruined a superior experience for this game.

With the game being sub 20$ or even 10$ if you willing to go used, it is a great value. Probably not so much when people bought it at launch. I would recommend.",My First Exposure to Uncharted Series,1454976000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
3.0,False,"05 7, 2012",A3S1YIQQW7AZO,B002BSA1MQ,EMAN NEP,"Having heard good things about the first CRYSIS game, I was eager to give CRYSIS 2 a spin to see what the hype was all about. While I can certainly see why this series commands such a following, at the same time I was a bit underwhelmed with what was presented. . .

STORY: Absolutely throwaway. Right from the get-go I had no clue what was going on. So New York is under attack by aliens and patrolled by soldiers. What else is new? I would even say that the story felt a bit like Pac-Man in that I was basically chasing dots (the blue destination dots) just going from point to point.

CHARACTERS: Not very interesting. Let's see, I play the role of a mute maniac with a machine gun and yes, there's the scientist guy with Tourette's syndrome.

GRAPHICS: Pretty good, but I felt that a lot of the environments were too dark and drab to really appreciate it. I specifically remember towards the beginning of the game where I saw this brass-colored blob on the ground next to a mounted machine gun. Guess what it was? Probably the ugliest-looking bullet casings I have ever seen in a game.

GAMEPLAY: This is where the game gets some points in its favor . . .
--Headshots to every soldier in sight while cloaked is definitely entertaining.
--Holding your ground with armor activated and blasting everything to bits is also entertaining.
--I also liked the ability to modify weapons on the go, everything from sights to firing modes to secondary weapons.
--Some fairly interesting scripted sequences.
--IR mode makes you feel like Predator.
--A little bit of freedom in how you get to your destination.

. . . but still, all is not rosy and peachy. . .

--The main premise of CRYSIS is that you have a really powerful suit . . . but you start the game with almost all of your abilities locked in the name of ""holding your hand"" tutorial-style.

--I was absolutely baffled by the following: You can throw a bottle or bag of trash across the room. You can turn a computer on, work the printer and water cooler . . . but God forbid that you be able to do something useful like turn on a light-switch, pull the fire alarm for a diversion or interact with some of those infected people. I don't understand why a programmer would dedicate lines of code to allow my character to do something that is basically meaningless.

--Absolutely horrific AI. I stood on the second level of a building. At my feet was a hole in the floor where I was looking down on the heads of a bunch of soldiers. Do you think they ever bothered to look up? Even after bodies started heaping up in full view? Nope. They just walked around like the oblivious idiots they were. If you want to see some reactive AI, play F.E.A.R.

--Okay, so I've already told you that the AI is stupid. So why am I still dying? It's because one of the few good things about this game is that damage is somewhat realistic. Despite your Nano-suit, if you try and go Gung-Ho into the midst of battle, you're not going to last long.

--Unimpressive upgrades. I was really looking forward to upgrading my Nano-Suit. Let's see, there's bullet tracking, which sounds pointless because I'm cloaked almost the whole time and kill everyone before they even get a shot out. There's a bonus for ledge-grabbing and sprinting . . . also pointless because again, I stay cloaked most of the time and move slowly to make the most of it.
I basically unlocked the first two rows of upgrades for my suit and didn't find a single one that seemed worthwhile, considering the rarity of finding aliens to kill to be able to afford them.

OVERALL: I probably played a good 5-6 hours worth of this game (I got as far as finding the Hive), but in all that time the only upgrades available were pretty much worthless, which basically reduced this game to something that was half FPS and half Metal Gear. The lack of enemies was disappointing (nameless soldiers and chthonic aliens . . . again) and made even more disappointing given how stupid their AI was.

I played NFS Underground years ago and I was interesting in this game because it takes place in LA, where I live. So, I decided to pre-order this one after seeing some trailers. But it's not what I expected.

Pros: Nice graphics. The environment looks great even though they cut down the size and details of the city quite a bit. Physics of driving and collision are decent. Plenty of cars to choose and customizations to play with. Many race modes and gameplay mechanisms such as Nitrous, Cold-air intake keep the race interesting. There are more abilities that I haven't gotten to yet, like EMP, Roar, Zoom. And even though you're not a great racer, you can still earn points and upgrades.

Cons: The hard-core racers may find the game quite challenging. But this game could be too unforgiving for a not-so-great racer, considering the amount of the obstacles on the road. Just hit something to a stop more than once and you're done for, while the AIs rarely made a mistake. Sometimes I think they even hit the traffic cars on purpose to make you crash.

Traffic AIs act like they hate you specifically. They could pop up in a distance that is really hard to swerve. Many times even though I managed to make a pretty nice drift at a sharp corner, AI cars came out of nowhere, crash into me, and that almost certainly cost me that race. Collision detection of the traffic cars could be a little elusive, so it's hard to make a tight swerve while running in high speed.

You could get lost quite easily because of the open routes. It's realistic, but quite distracting having to glance at the GPS every now and then, while you have to race the opponents and avoid the traffic at the same time. Free-roaming could be tedious because of the traffic and cops. It's almost impossible to lose the LAPD cars during the early hours of the game with your mediocre car and they take away too much of your hard-earned cash.

Cockpit camera looks okay, but the Chase-camera looks stiff. And many times you couldn't see an opponent coming from behind. It could hit you and send you crashing into a wall, right before the finish line, after you take the lead for almost the entire race.

Inconclusion: This game could be one of those 'Hate It or Love It' games.
The game has a lot of potentials, but I'm not patient enough to stay and find out.

You might agree or disagree, the safest way to find out is renting it first. So you don't have to get frustrated and lose your money for a game that does not suit you.

Of course most of the quest only require you to get less than ten items or kills. That makes it quick to get a quest done. Of course alot of the quest are in PQ areas, and if you happen to trigger the final number needed for the next stage, things will get a lot harder and the targets you need will not respawn. If the PQ reset, which happens when the stages are completed or fails, then every creature part of that PQ respawns at the exact same time. which sucks when you get to the scroll you need and jumped by 4 guys that you just cleared out.

Sometimes the quest have you try and find a item, of course they give you a general indicator where it can be. That is a good feature, where you don't have to guess where something is on the map. then that is it, you have to do the old mouse cursor search method until something lights up. trying to find a rune, that is surrounded by enemies, flat on the ground and covered in grass is alot of fun when you don't know what it looks like.

Combat is a little rough, it doesn't auto release a dead target for a live one that is attacking you. You can also run miles and still have the same dead target selected. Then there are the bugs where the NPC enemy will reset, auto heal and then come back at you with your half health. Of course it seems only certain targets will cause a link, where everyone around the target will attack you. If you pick the normal targets and then you don't have to worry about that.
You are also smashing your special attacks, because most times it looks like the normal attacks just involve you standing there getting hit.
If you see a friendly NPC getting hit, and you attack it's enemy that is almost dead. you can claim that enemy kill, xp, gold, and items, even if it is a champion type.

RvR scenario is interesting, but not very balanced when it comes weapons and armor. Granted it bumps you up to the average level, say to 17 from your real level of 13. Of course the level 20s with there better armor and weapons, make it a bit tougher to get a kill. You can hit them and it seems you are not doing any damage. Which gets bad when you have alot of lower levels on your side.
The normal RvR is not much better, where a single person can pick off the guards to get the point. Sort of pointless it seems, where it doesn't seem you are making any head way.
There is very little in the way of instruction, sometimes you have to figure how to do something by trial and error. Flying is the only way to get around, within a region you have to find the flight masters. Flights between the regions all you have to do is click on the name of the region. I found that by accident, there was nothing about that in the Faqs or anywhere eles I looked within the game.

Alot of the ideas are almost a photo copy of WoW. The same item colors, grey, white, green, and blue. alot of the control defaults are there also. So if you played WoW, you won't have much of a issue with the controls and such.

MacMahon,"Dragon Age: Origins being a lovely homage to classic Infinity Engine role-playing games was a great surprise and a light in the darkness of mid-2000's PC gaming, where it seemed everything was console-focused. Dragon Age 2, while deeply flawed, at least maintained that tactical PC style combat at the heart of it. Now, in an age where indie studios, Kickstarter and digital distribution have opened the gates to numerous classic PC style RPGs, where does the third Dragon Age game come out? Firmly in the console action game camp, sadly.

There are a few immediate aspects to Inquisition you need to know. First, the areas and quests and extremely MMO-like in how they play. This is an offline WoW game with action combat, very similar to Kingdoms of Amalur, which I reviewed a couple years ago. Quest dialog is very rare and very simple when it happens. Most quests will be started by letters or discovering them on your war room map. None of them have cinematic or dialog tree moments, all of them play just like an MMO quest would. There are many ""collect 10 of these for the villagers"" quests. There are many enemy bases that are nothing but several rooms of enemies and a boss who attacks on-sight. There are even fairly obvious respawns should you turn around for any reason!

Secondly, this game controls like a port of a gamepad action game. That's not to say the PC version controls ""badly"" necessarily, as for a standard WASD action game I think it controls about normal. The lack of click-to-move and click-to-attack and such is a fundamental game decision, not a control issue. You play this game running around the fields and mashing your attack buttons when you stumble on an enemy. You run up to things and press 'E' to interact with them. It's a third-person action game in control and design, not a PC style RPG, and that's the core control ""issue."" If you like games like Witcher 2 or Kingdoms of Amalur you'll be okay here.

Lastly, the tactical combat is rare. Ninety percent of your combat experience will be in the field with trash mobs, just like an MMO. Every once in a while you will fight a boss or other set-piece, which could be considered roughly the equivalent of Dragon Age: Origins' designed tactical battles. However even in these confrontations you'll mostly be playing it action style. There are less abilities and your companions spam them appropriately, so there is little reason to switch to them and look at an empty hotbar. The game is designed to control your main character in action game fashion and anything else is superfluous. You might pause here and there to ensure someone takes a potion or gets out of dodge (on hard mode) but otherwise even in these ""tactical battles"" you can just run around and spam your abilities appropriately.

These complaints and changes aside, graphics and story are up to the usual Bioware standard. I'm playing on an older PC with a mix of medium and high settings and it still looks amazing, well above the two previous games in both scope and detail. The visual design is mostly fabulous, though it reminds you constantly that it's all for show and nothing is really happening in these great areas. While a great lighthouse can be found through exploring a beautiful swamp, once you get there all you can do is plant a flag for yet another collect-a-thon sidequest. No one lives there, no real quest goes there, it's just art for art's sake.

The main quest is very good however. I am in the final act and it goes through a lot of religious, social and personal themes that most games wouldn't touch. You can be Jesus or Judas, or you can be a frustrated atheist struggling to deal with all of it. That comes across quite well. On average the main quests are better designed than the MMO filler side-content, and offer unique dungeons and areas that feel more in tune with Dragon Age's previous. It's almost like two different games, and I wish the main quest game were the one we got everywhere else.

All in all if you like MMO quest design and action combat you will find a lot to like here. I'm still not sure as an action experience it can really top dedicated action games, but it does an okay job and the exploring and great story will be all a lot of people want or expect from it. If you're looking for a PC RPG in the style of Dragon Age: Origins however, you will not find it here, and you will be filled with disappointment and not a small amount of resentment as a result. Know what you're getting into going in and Inquisition might be a thrilling experience.","An Offline MMO That Disappoints Dragon Age Fans, Yet Has Its Own Charms",1416700800,148,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC [Digital Code]'}",

THE RIGHT TRIGGER TO PASS. So why did I buy EA Sports' product over the smoother, pass and teamwork-friendly NHL 2K7, with its numerous game modes, ground-breaking camera angle and excellent online playability?

It is as the rumors say: The Skill Stick.

Every gaming review has advised that it may take up to over a dozen games just to get used to the NHL 07 Skill Stick, which, undisputedly, is the future of video game hockey. Say to yourself, ""Learn it now, and hope NHL 08 will have the rest of its game presentation catch up to its technology."" But the reviews are spot on--you will need at least a dozen games to get comfortable.

There are several tweaks and things you can do to ease yourself in: set your controller settings to ""Classic"" and change ""Camera Relative"" to ""Always Up"" to be able to have a hybrid controller where you can use the classic EA Sports hockey setup, as well as the Skill Stick; play hours of the Shootout mode; and start off playing at the Pro level for about three games, before moving on to more difficult play.

Let me put it this way: you intercept a pass in the neutral zone, and skate untouched toward the opposing goalie. God help you if your only option is to press a deke button, aim, and shoot, and hope the computer odds let your goal in.

Now imagine being able to skate up, deke left, pull right for a wrister, then, just as the goalie commits to the right side, pull your stick back left and flip it top shelf, backhanded over his glove.

Imagine no more. If you can think it, the Skill Stick can do it: high, low, five-hole, top shelf, flip, wrister, slap, snap...everything. It just  seems ridiculous that you would want to skate in such critical moments such as breakaways, penalty shots and shootouts without at least an 85 percent chance of scoring. Sure it's offensively biased, but in real-life hockey, the one-on-one situation will always favor the skilled scorer against the skilled goalie--the scorer just has too many moves, and the goalie can only react.

It'll be a sacrifice, so buying the game used is probably recommended; it's not a complete package, but you'll be glad you've mastered the Skill Stick by the time a hopefully superior NHL 08 comes out, with you steps ahead of the rest of the competition.

If you like team play, with great passing, and bum rush the net strategies, get the 2K7 offering. It's user-friendly, and you can be reasonably competitive online in a matter of two or three games. But if the thrill of getting to an open spot on the ice and having every shot aimed at ANY location at your disposal, 07's Skill Stick is by far the way to go. It's like comparing Doom II to 360's Ghost Recon, in terms of controls.

3.0,True,"05 3, 2011",A3HN7D7HEQGM1R,B003Q53VZC,Brendan Foy,"First let me start and say that I had high hopes for Homefront as a game ever since I played Frontlines: Fuel of War for well over a year thanks to its highly addictive multiplayer. Frontlines was clearly a first effort from a young studio, but it showed promise and had a charm that many big budget games from publishers with deeper pockets don't. When I heard Homefront was in development by Kaos Studios and THQ, I was overjoyed and fully expected a further realized and more polished spiritual sequel to my beloved Frontlines. Upon completion of Homefront single player and spending over a month with the multi player, it is clear that this is not a sequel to Frontlines and must be judged on its own merits, as its own game. This is not a review of what I hoped Frontlines 2 would be, in that regard I am disappointed in the direction they chose to go in, this is a review of Homefront as its own game and series. Homefront is in fact quite fun, it is more of a mix between Call of Duty and the Battlefield: Bad Company franchises with influences in both the single and multi player portions of the game.

Homefront is clearly a multi player centric game, as was Frontlines before it. I always knew this but many will pick up this game primarily, if not solely, for the single player so the campaign must be weighed accordingly. THQ and Kaos Studios have pushed the single player hard, put quite a bit of work into it and throw around John Milius' name and previous work such as Apocalypse Now and Red Dawn quite liberally. The single player is not meant to be a throw away campaign yet when all is said and done it is quite forgettable. On the back of the Homefront case is written, ""From the writer of Red Dawn and Apocalypse Now"", there is even a book released to lay down a backstory for the game. Kaos even went on record citing Half-Life 2 as an inspiration for how their campaign was put together yet after having completed the campaign you will be wondering just how much John Milius actually had to do with this project and how long it has been since anyone at Kaos has played either of the Half-Life games.

The single player campaign is not terrible by any means, but it certainly isn't great either. The biggest problem is the pacing, which is ironic considering the mentioned Half-Life influence and anyone familiar with Valve knows their approach to developing Half-Life involves making sure the pacing is just right to always keep the gamer interested and immersed in the experience. The Half-Life games are the video game equivalent of a page turner, Homefront is not. John Milius' work has the tendency to conjure up all sorts of emotion within you yet Homefront fails to do so in its campaign. The game is one action set piece after another with rather straight forward and at times generic First Person Shooter gameplay. There is no meaningful character development, no ups and downs in the story telling and no real build up to the climax; there isn't even a proper ending as the game just sort of stops after 7 chapters. Homefront does end strongly with a rather intense finale, but it was not enough to save the campaign from being an average overall experience.

The game starts off promising where you wake up in your dingy apartment in a Korean occupied America. You have a brief moment to look around your apartment until you hear some loud and determined knocking on your door from soldiers of the Greater Korean Republic. As soon as you walk to the door it triggers an in game cut scene where the soldiers kick the door in, have a few words for you about needing your services as a pilot and haul you off to a bus which will take you to a re-education center to ensure your loyalty to the Koreans. In this bus you are free to look around as it drives by the ravaged and occupied suburban town that could easily be any one of our neighborhoods. You see some pretty disturbing stuff on this short bus trip until a resistance cell, also in need of your services as a pilot, interferes with the bus trip and frees you. From here on out you basically follow Rihanna, an attractive but feisty femme fatale, Connor, a brazen and gung ho fighter, and Hopper, a tech geek Korean-American through 7 chapters of firefights.

The core gameplay consists of following them and shooting enemy soldiers, making your way to highlighted objectives, standing your ground at a highlighted point of interest and essentially fighting your way from point A to point B in each chapter. The game is heavily scripted, which is normally perfectly fine except in Homefront it often intrudes on the gameplay. You play for a bit, complete an objective and the action stops while the characters talk or something happens. It is frequent and interferes with the flow of the game. The game is linear, which is also perfectly fine, except the actual shooting can be rather bland where you take some hits, find cover to regenerate health, pop your head out to find the enemy, wait for him to pop his head out and shoot it off; it is the whack a mole approach to the FPS and it feels dated. There are moments when you get to control a remote controlled drone called Goliath which consists of pressing the right trigger to highlight enemy targets so Goliath can shoot rockets at them, which does mix up the gameplay somewhat and is relatively fun, but you're limited to what you can do with Goliath and it would have been nice to have more drones at your disposal as single player went on. There are some segments where you serve as the gunner on a Humvee, nothing that hasn't been done before, and there are a couple pretty cool but all too short Helicopter flight sequences where you serve as the pilot in one and a passenger in the other. You have your standard sniper level and night level but nothing truly stands out. The final two chapters in the game offer a nice change of pace where the action really gets going and flows quite nicely, but even here the level design can get somewhat derivative.

The game uses the same control scheme as the Call of Duty games which I am sure most people here are familiar with so I won't get into it too much. Right trigger shoots, left trigger aims down the sight, Right bumper throws grenade which you can hold to ""cook"" the grenade so it explodes quicker after release, left bumper throws secondary grenade/explosive like C4, Y button switches weapons, X button reloads, B button is to crouch and you hold it to go prone, A button jumps, click left stick to sprint and click right stick to melee, standard dual analog movement and aiming. The controls work and are responsive but it would be nice to see one developer, one of these days, try to do something different in this genre so their game feels different.

The graphics in this campaign look fine to me, nothing spectacular but attractive enough and the sound is decent, though grenades didn't seem to make the appropriate clanging sound they should have when landing near me. No real environmental destruction here either like in Red Faction or Bad Company unless it is scripted destruction.

As mentioned before, the campaign is laid out where you move from one action set piece to another. It's like a Michael Bay film with one in your face high explosive moment after another neglecting both character and plot development. I could not really form any emotional attachment to any of the characters and though I did not like seeing my country and innocent civilians terrorized, I really couldn't feel much as I'm constantly being lead (or dragged) by a leash to the next action set piece. There was a lot of potential in the story too, John Milius' involvement aside, but I just felt rushed the whole way through. One big appeal of the Half-Life games is how the whole experience was all so seamless, like you felt you were really progressing towards something big, but Homefront is divided up into 7 loosely knit chapters and they just didn't flow together smoothly. I would say the single player is worth a rental, it has its moments, but the game is not worth a purchase for the single player alone. I completed the game in 6 and a half hours on the second hardest difficulty setting, a lot of trial and error dying took up my time so I would imagine on the easier settings that each chapter is quite short.

Multiplayer is what Homefront is really all about. KAOS comes from a multi player centric background with their Battlefield: Desert Combat Mod several years ago and their first full retail title in 2008, Frontlines: Fuel of War, which was heavily inspired by the Battlefield franchise. Homefront serves up a complex, balanced and very fun multi player experience which holds its own against the competition from other console shooters.

The Homefront multi player takes place before the Korean occupation and pits American military against KPR forces. You will have access to a wide range of vehicles, drones, weapons and perks to use as you see fit on rather large maps which average around three times the size of your typical Call of Duty map and compare with those of Bad Company 2. The action is pretty intense and fast paced, much more so than Bad Company 2, but surprisingly balanced considering all that is offered and feels like a great mix of both Bad Company 2 and Call of Duty; it's basically what Medal of Honor should have been.

The multi player experience centers around Battle Points which you earn for completing various actions such as killing an enemy, assisting with an enemy kill, EMP assisting a vehicle kill, destroying a vehicle, protecting a teammate, avenging a teammate, capturing an objective, protecting an objective, going on a kill streak and even going on a death streak (for those who are struggling but still want to earn points to get in on the fun). Battle Points can be used to ""purchase"" certain special weapons such as an RPG to help take out an enemy vehicle, personal support such as a personal UAV or flak jacket, a drone when needed for scout or assault, calling in air strikes and yes, calling in vehicles such as heavy tanks. Battle Points have often been incorrectly compared to Kill Steaks in COD since both are a point system which unlocks special abilities but as just mentioned, you get these points for doing much more than just killing and if you die, your points carry over into your next spawn. Aside from the obvious thrill of unlocking a Heavy Tank or Apache Chopper when you save up enough Battle Points (BP), there is a strategic element to when and how you use your BP; do you want to wait until you have enough BP to spend on a powerful vehicle to punish the enemy team with or will you spend your BP early on RPGs and proximity launchers to take down enemy vehicles or purchase a light armored vehicle with an anti air attack to take down the enemy chopper? Perhaps you should spend the BP on a personal UAV to help you defend or secure an objective which is undermanned or call in a scout drone to mark the enemy's position on the map to help your team push them back and win. Sitting on your BP and waiting for that chopper may cost your team a victory while spending it when needed helps everyone out and can actually accelerate your BP gain as you become responsible for more and more positive results which the game often astutely recognizes and rewards you for. I've been playing the game for a month now and so far everything seems appropriately priced when it comes to BP. The only real gripe I have right now is that there is a bug which needs to be patched for vehicle assists. If you EMP a vehicle and it gets destroyed, you get an assist, but if you do most of the work destroying a drone or vehicle and someone else gets the final shot which destroys it, you get nothing. KAOS said they are aware of this bug and working on it, otherwise the game rewards you when you deserve it.

Another benefit to the BP system is the lack of static vehicle spawns which means no vehicle camping. In Battlefield games or Homefront it would be a common sight to see as much as half of your team hanging around the chopper spawn just waiting for their turn to fly while the rest of the team gets slaughtered in battle. With Homefront, your team is forced to take part in the action if they want to earn any of the cool toys (emphasis on the word EARN). There are still camping snipers as there are in any game, but they are more pests than game changers and don't rack up the BP points as much as you'd expect. The downside to no vehicle spawns is you can't rush behind enemy lines and steal unguarded vehicles as you often could in classic Battlefield games or Frontlines, and though it's nice the enemy team can't do this to you either, I still miss the added threat and responsibility of having to watch out for our own vehicles being used against us.

A major draw to the multiplayer is the use of vehicles and drones during battle. There is a respectable variety to choose from with 2 different types of Helicopter, 1 Heavy Tank, 1 Light Armored vehicle and 1 Humvee for each team and for drones you have two flight based and two ground based. Each vehicle and drone serves its own purpose and when used correctly, everything has an answer for something else. Add in air strikes such as a Hellfire missile or White Phosphorous and you have quite a bit to work for in a match in addition to the different weapons and perks you earn for leveling up over time (a system lifted right out of COD).

The weapons and perks are typical of what you would see in a military shooter such as this, if you've played COD then you pretty much know what to expect here (Assault Rifles, SMGs, Shotguns, Pistol, Sniper Rifle, Knife). Some complain that the weapon sounds aren't all that satisfying or that there is not enough to choose from but I personally thought they sounded just fine and would take weapon balance over weapon quantity any day. The perks are again pretty standard fare but work well with the game without anything jumping out as being too outrageous save for the knife lunge perk which isn't as bad as it was in MW2. If you get high enough kill streaks with each weapon you can pimp out your gun Army of Two style with some wild designs. It might not be particularly inconspicuous, but it's a lot of fun to use the ""I love my gun"" design which gives you a hot pink gun covered in hearts.

As far as multi player game modes, Homefront claims to have 4 different modes: Ground Control (GC), Ground Control with Battle Commander, Team Death Match (TDM) and Team Death Match with Battle Commander. Battle Commander is a variation on the GC and TDM modes where an A.I. commander will mark specific targets for you and some others on your team to destroy to gain extra BP to spend. It definitely adds to the experience of each mode but it is more of a variation than a whole different game mode. Ground Control is the meat of the multi player, it is to Homefront what Rush is to Bad Company and Conquest was to classic Battlefield. In GC each team starts off battling over 3 objectives while a points bar fills up for each team. The more objectives you secure and hold and the more of the enemy team you destroy, the faster your bar will fill up and once full the enemy gets pushed back to another set of 3 objectives. If you beat them down a second time you win as it is a best of 3 for each match. In each match of ground control you have 3 sets of objectives: the starting set, one you push your enemy back to and one your enemy can push you back to; matches can often end where you don't ever get to one set of objectives as one team was never pushed back to it. The battles for these objectives are pretty furious and each map starts off slow and quickly builds the pace until it's a complete clusterfark at the end with vehicles, drones and explosions everywhere. Ground Control is fun and strategic, but it's not quite strong enough of a mode to carry this game.

Many matches often end too quick, sometimes as quick as 10 minutes. The battles are concentrated on the objectives with little reason to rush behind enemy lines (no vehicle spawning so no need to steal or sabotage enemy vehicles) or hang back behind your lines (to prevent enemies stealing or sabotaging your vehicles) which takes away the quasi-sandbox feel of KAOS' previous game, Frontlines: Fuel of War, which had many little side battles in addition to the main battles over the objectives. All you can do with an objective is stand there and secure it, there is no demolition or hacking or any other requirement to take an objective which would mix up the game play some. Ground Control just doesn't feel as open or expansive as Battlefield's Conquest mode or Frontlines' Frontlines mode. It would be nice if there was an enemy base of sorts that had to be conquered after you push the enemy back to it, but instead you spend your time usually fighting over 2 sets of objectives back and forth which means Ground Control plays smaller than the maps they take place on. The spawn system is a good example of this as there is no squad spawning or spawn selection, the game picks it for you. I suppose they didn't want too many people spawning right on the objectives but at least let me choose which objective I can spawn near, I'm just going to run across the map to where my friends are anyway as I trust them to watch my back than some random without a microphone. The nice thing about the spawn system is as you are zooming in to your spawn point, you get a brief glimpse of the map and locations of your enemies and allies; this is handy because you can easily spot camping spawn killers. There is a nice tug of war feel to the GC mode, but it is nowhere near as rewarding or intense as what Frontlines had.

The map selection is also limited with Ground Control. There are 8 listed maps, but only 5 are available with regular GC and with others opened up for GC:BC. Each map is well designed but they all play very similar. One thing I loved about Frontlines was how each map not only had its own distinct personality, but also offered up its own gaming experience with certain vehicles being exclusive to certain maps, different ways to capture each objective and even one different game mode for a specific map. One map in Frontlines would be infantry only while another would be massive with Jets and landing strips, it did much to add to the re-playability of that game where every map almost felt like a different game. The maps here, with the modes provided, just don't offer up the same diversity which is a shame. Judging Homefront as its own game, it is fun, but judging it against its spiritual predecessor it can come up short. The other mode, Team Death Match, is your typical Team Death Match except vehicles and drones are introduced. I am not a big TDM player, but it is well done for what it is and quite challenging.

The graphics in the multi player have been criticized by many reviewers but I personally think they are just fine considering the player count, large maps and amount of mayhem which takes place on the screen. The lack of destructibility of any kind is a real drag, especially when a tank can't destroy a picket fence, but there really isn't any other game (save Frontlines) on the 360 which offers this kind of selection in terms of vehicles and drones. 4 Apaches in the sky with 3 heavy tanks and drones aplenty is a pretty impressive sight, all with 32 players on one server. The graphics may not be great, but they aren't terrible either.

I have written this review after a month of play, so I have a good feel for the game and have witnessed its launch issues and the subsequent patches. As I write this, one official patch has been released with many smaller server side patches snuck in as well, and many new servers have been put up. At launch people had difficulty getting into a match because of lack of servers, this was pretty much fixed a week after launch in North America. Some people were getting a freezing bug which rendered the game unplayable; a patch was released 2 weeks after release. Others have had difficulty forming a party and bringing it into a match and while this is still an issue, I can regularly get a party of around 6-8 into a match and have gotten as many as 11 in (the max is 16, a second patch is supposed to address the party issue so 16 players will be able to get in). When in a match the game runs smooth as silk and has been since 2 weeks after launch. As far as connection and stability go, the game has been no more troublesome than any other big release as of late and I would argue has had less problems.

Homefront is a good game, Homefront is a fun game. The single player is short and fails to live up to what it could have been, but it has its moments. Considering how it is marketed as being from the writer of Apocalypse Now and Red Dawn, it is a disappointment. The multi player is definitely fun and more than makes up for the single player, but the lack of maps, game modes and limited nature of Ground Control means I may have had a blast playing for this past month, but I don't see this game having anywhere near the legs that Frontlines or the classic Battlefield games had. I wanted this game to be Frontlines 2, a sequel to Kaos Studios' previous effort on the 360, but it came up short. I can judge Homefront as its own game, and have done so in this review, but in the end it's not as good as what a Frontlines 2 could have been. Still, if you enjoy Call of Duty and Bad Company 2, you might as well pick up Homefront as it offers a pretty fun mix of the two.",The Comprehensive Homefront Review,1304380800,3,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

If you have never touched a RE game before this is probably not a good one to get introduced to the series by, just because you'd be lost as to which weapons to use for different monsters. The unlimited ammo for the standard handgun is nice. The other weapons you collect ammo for and conserve. It can be annoying when you only have a split second to pick up an item though, because you can't move your own character, you can't go back and get it!

It still has a lot of the creepiness of the first two in the series for those that love that about the Dead Space universe. I did however feel the game needed a breakup of settings of sorts, and this game definitely delivers on that front. However, I do agree that it seems kind of not certain of what it exactly wants to be, and that the combat situations are clunky and not done very well. However, what bothers me by far the most about this game as opposed to the first two are 1), it is MUCH harder. I played this game on the easiest level, and was still fighting for my life at every turn, so much so that it wasn't even fun. On it's easiest level (casual), it was harder than Dead Space 2 was on the next level up. You practically don't have a moment to relax and catch your breath, ever, which brings me to the next thing I hated about this game, 2) the weapons crafting system, is an overly complicated mess! Gone is the simplistic way the first two games allowed you to upgrade your weapons, and no matter how you upgrade them, they are never nearly as powerful as the situation calls for, which is again, part of what makes it so much harder (and not as fun) as Dead Space 2. Even when you find a weapon that works well against a certain necromorph, it may not work as well against a different necromoprh, on the SAME LEVEL. Who cares how good it may work against one type of enemy, when it works like crap against the very next one! This may not be as big of deal, but unlike the first two Dead Space games, where you could carry up to four weapons, you can never carry more than two here, which only leaves you even less prepared to face the necromorphs who are literally in droves around every corner.

The game has a distinctive 'drawn' art style to its characters, and some unique personalities to the conversations, plus several moments of solid humor.

It has honestly been some time since my play, but what I can say about the game is that storywise, it doesn't feel so fulfilling. For a game that focuses itself entirely on telling the history of all its characters, and what has brought them all to this hotel, I didn't get any conclusion that felt wholely satisfying. Many of the hotel's patrons leave unsatisfied, not finding what they came here for, and the ultimate disappointment of the game: Once you have solved the hotel's last mystery, nothing happens. No one is arrested for murder or conspiracy, no one is reunited with their lost sibling, no one is saved from a cruel twist of fate. Kyle just says ""Oh. I figured out everything that happened here. That's nice."" And he drives away.

So, you need the goggles to find the ghosts, but then when you finally do, you are utterly defenseless until you remove the goggles by pressing Y, afterwhich it is already too late and the ghost has knocked you down or escaped.

Its really a matter of perspective, I for one liked Advanced Warfare, but nothing more than that. The story was forgettable at best, the characters were laughably done, the mission structure is still banal and archaic, and certain frustrations that have plagued the COD formula are still present and haven't been addressed. The Exo abilities and other added flare are nice additions, but don't really bring enough to the table to truly innovate and expand on this aging franchise. Are we at the point of surrender, to the point where Call of Duty will never do anything to vastly change its ways? Yes the multiplayer is fun, and the Exo Survival coop mode is excellent, but neither can be deemed as game changers and are relatively derivative. I, myself, am content with the current direction of the Call of Duty franchise; as long as it continues to remain on top, it will do little to change its core formula. I like the Call of Duty games, but at this point, there is no real reason to annually buy this franchise. Perhaps Ill skip a few entries and then jump back in for a slight, refreshing experience, but even then Id be hard pressed to find something that truly captivated me. Advanced Warfare will be known for its fantastic presentation value, superb work done by Kevin Spacey, addictive cooperative mode, and gorgeously rendered cut scenes, but I don't really see die-hard COD fans nor disbelievers truly remembering this game, let alone it being their favorite COD title.

Since he escaped the Titan Sprawl his life has been on a downward spiral, Ellie has left him, his landlord is kicking him out of his New Horizons bedsit, and he's a broken man. Wouldn't you be after facing the Necromorph menace twice already? In the meantime EarthGov has fallen and the Unitologists, led by the odious Jacob Danik, are bombarding what is left of humanity. Issac is seized by the last EarthGov battalion and hurtled to the other side of the galaxy to Tau Volantis, a frozen planet orbited by 200-year-old wrecks of the Sovereign Colonies. Ellie, convinced she has found the Marker homeworld, is somewhere amid the wrecks and has assembled a ramshackle plan to destroy the Necromorphs once and for all.

After a slow start, the game is sort of split into two halves as Issac explores the decaying, orbiting wrecks and solves the mystery of the frozen planet below. The first half feels a lot like the familiar Dead Space formula while the second half feels like a generic shoot-em-up in the vain of COD. The relentless wave after wave of Necromorphs is mind-numbing. The overwhelming sense of dread and gut-wrenching anxiety that permeated every square inch of the first two games is largely gone. There are still shocks and scares, and the sound of elevators arriving are still frighteningly similar to the shrieks of the Necromorphs but it feels stale at this point. I felt like logic and sense took a back seat here. How did the Necromorphs end up on the New Horizons colony? How did they end up on the CMS Roanoke or Greely for that matter? It's never clearly explained. Why did the Sovereign Colonies Armed Forces panic so easily and opt for mass-murder/suicide instead of pushing for further research into the alien machine? It seemed like such a mindless and heavy-handed reason to have Tau Volantis scattered with body parts.

It seems like it goes on forever, even if you ignore the optional side-quests. Upgrading your weapons and suits never feels like it has a noticeable effect but the weapons crafting feature can lead to some fun inventions. The co-op gameplay comes across like a last-minute addition (and it was) and it is not the kind of thing Dead Space fans want from this series. Online play is necessary for the Platinum Trophy but there's no way I can get it as the Hardcore trophy is just too difficult and time-consuming, especially since you cannot skip the cut-scenes.

For those that haven't played this series for a while but have in the past, don't worry, the controls are all essentially the same as back in the day.  You can still use the d-pad for the entire game, you still have to pull off unbelievable tricks and rack up a god-awful amount of points to beat ""goals"".  Most of the aging hippie line-up you remember from THPS2 are still there, only looking a lot older than before.  Overall, this should have been called Tony Hawk 2007, because there isn't anything revolutionary beyond the slo-motion trick mode that caught my eye.

You start off with a stock skater you build on your own that is desperately trying to be ranked within the top 8 skaters in the world.  This person has the chance to be Tony Hawk's maidservant on his pro skate tour.  You get to talk to people around your area that give you quests to do, like retrieve golf balls, do an amazing trick off a fence or ramp, or chase a guy around that videos you while you do tricks.  All the while, you are trying to build up your reputation and rank against a group of 200 faceless other skaters all competing for the same prize.  This becomes a recurring theme throughout the game.

Project 8 is all about trial-and-error gameplay.  If you screw up a trick, get back up and do it again.  You'll end up doing a trick over-and over up to 100 times just to land it exactly the way the game tells you to.  And when I say exactly, I stress that in the highest.  You also have a time limit on some quests to complete a set number of goals.  If you can't get all of the goals completed, you get back up and keep going over and over till you get it right.  If this doesn't sound like fun, then this game isn't for you.

The open-ended gameplay of being able to skate on virtually everything (even water) and just bust out crazy tricks and bone-crunching bails to your hearts content makes the game fun on its own.  You can run over people you skate by style without any penalty to you, or try to grind on that unbelievably high pole in the air.  Nail the trick mode was an interesting part of the game, as you try to bust out a timed board move in mid-air, in slow motion.  This was probably the best feature I found in the game, as it gave you a chance to invent your own tricks.

That is unfortunately where the fun ends.  If you want to progress anywhere in the game or open up new areas, you must complete somewhat easy, but then ludicrously hard goals.  These goals are pretty much the same thing from every other Pro Skater game that's hit the market in the past.  Collect letters, find the secret area, wallgrind the posters, rack up 50,000 points etc.  The gameplay of Project 8 felt no different than GTA3 now except you're not packing heat and bustin'a cap on the locals.  Your character never talks, never gets to make decisions on their own, and ultimately seems pretty shallow in that their only goal in life is to be recognized by Tony Hawk.

According to Activision, this game was made ""with great care"" for the XBOX 360 and is considered the flagship version of the game.  So why am I experiencing slowdown when going into certain areas?  Why can't I get to build my own skate park like I could in Tony Hawk 2?  What happened to being able to place your own stats where you wanted them, rather than having to do the same spin move over and over to build your character up?

At the core, Project 8 is a great game because it gives you a skater world like no other.  It will always be a good game because busting out crazy tricks like you can in this game will always look cool to spectators watching people play.  You will find no game with greater accuracy to trick names, board styles, and celebrity endorsements.  All the clothing, skateboard logos and the latest emo fashions are available, with a great punk/hip-hop soundtrack.  I just don't get why the game feels so shallow and bugged after all these years, especially on a next generation system.  Hopefully Activision will work out the kinks, and maybe finally give the Tony Hawk series a 2008 name.  Then again, skaters never like to conform to the norm.",It's a great game with playability issues,1167264000,,,

the game engine seems jittery and at times, when strafing, you will get negative feedback which causes your character's movement to stutter.

context sensitivity for environment interaction (i.e. doing S.W.A.T. turns--peeling off of cover) are not there when they should be.  Devs missed a lot--when they shouldn't.  trying to aim from cover often results in peeling you off the wall instead.  The blind fire itself, if you're trying to pull compound actions is pretty unpredictable.  It's really watered down the complexity of what a player can do.  For example, wanna pull off a headshot around the corner from cover and then horizontally jump away?  Good luck executing, maybe 2 of the 3 will happen, jumping--not aiming, maybe jumping and pulling of the shot in some random order.  I don't know if it's my connection but at a solid 55mb down and 5 up--I should be good.

Everything multiplayer is sad.  Matchmaking is atrocious and takes terribly-long.  King of the Hill (annex) only lasts 1 round.  Expect about 5 minutes between multiplayer matches (finish-to-next-start).  Oh and if you make it to the finish screen after a match--the screen is locked.  You cannot exit until the next screen loads (maybe 45-60 seconds later).

grenade physics respond as though you're shotputting a 16-lb bowling ball.  Unless you deliberately hold L-trigger to actually bolo throw the grenade--good luck getting it farther than 2-feet from you.  (use at your own peril)

The gnasher seems to be its old self (finally a praise) but hip firing is very deceptive because if you use the direction of the shotgun as an indicator--you will be horribly misled and it's intensely counterintertuitive to fire at the center of the screen--ignoring the direction the muzzle is pointing.

This is my favorite series of all time and I was nothing less than ecstatic to play.  I have all but sworn off video games due to the gloomy and uninspired video game culture that seems to be trending and I was hopeful for this but sorely disappointed with the rerelease.

It is what it is and it's still a lot of fun to play multiplayer sans the looming flaws aforementioned.

the campaign is the same as the PC version so there are extra chapteres compared to the original 360 version.

graphics look great but the feel is off...especially hipfiring the gnasher.",could've been awesome,1440633600,3,,

3.0,False,"12 30, 2012",A1COHD6P8ASVJI,B0050SVHZO,Old Guy Gamer,"First of all, I am admittedly a bit of a middle-aged Nintendo fanboy, I've owned every console since the original NES is the late 80's and many of the handhelds since the original Game and Watch series in the early 80's.  I have always prized the extremely high quality and durability of every piece of Nintendo hardware I have owned over the years, no one does it better in my opinion.  I did not hesitate to pre-order a launch system for Christmas, Nintendo's hardware is generally bulletproof.  I figured Nintendo's quality testing is so high, the Wii U would be immune to the widespread launch failures that plagued the Xbox 360 (RROD) and original PS3 (YLOD), etc.  Therefore, I was shocked and disappointed when I set up my kids new Wii U and the gamepad (not the console) started freezing every 15-20 seconds.  I did the initial update (took forever), it did not help a bit.  I spent countless, frustrating hours trying every fix on the planet, nothing worked.  When I went online to see if anyone else was having the same issue, I quickly discovered that many users were experiencing the same defect, it wasn't limited to just my unit.  Nintendo's support was of no help, the only solution is to mail it back for repair.  Seriously?  I just spent about $500 on the console, games and accessories and now I have to pack it up in a box, bring it to a UPS store, ship it off and wait for 2 weeks and hope the repaired/replaced unit actually works?  What kind of crap is that?  Try explaining to your young kids that their prized new Christmas gift now needs to be mailed away for a few weeks and they can't play the new Skylanders Giants game they have been excitedly waiting months for.  I have been burned as an early adopter before (it comes with the territory sometimes), but I hereby vow to NEVER be an early adopter again, this is the last launch console I am ever buying (regardless of brand).  I will wait a few months until they get all the bugs worked out, let other people deal with the headaches.  I recommend avoiding the Wii U for a couple of months until all the hardware/software bugs are worked out and all the defective launch stock is sold off the shelves.  I realize that many launch units are working fine, but based on what I read from so many other people online having the same issues, such a significant failure rate is an absolutely unacceptable quality problem (even for my beloved Nintendo).  Getting a new console is supposed to be a fun, exciting experience for the whole family, not a frustrating and sad disappointment.  Sorry Nintendo, you really dropped the ball on this one.
**UPDATE 12/31/2012: I convinced the retailer to exchange the defective unit for a replacement, the new unit works perfectly, kids are happy.  At this time, I would only recommend purchasing this item from a retail store that will give you a prompt, hassle-free exchange if you get a lemon.  When the console works, it is amazing, love it.  Since I am a sucker for Nintendo, I raised my original 1 star rating to 3 stars (would have been a perfect 5 stars if the first one wasn't a lemon).","Launch Console Defective, Needs Repair Straight out of the Box",1356825600,3,,
3.0,False,"07 14, 2008",A1MB5HUA3WYEJC,B0014468XE,Mike,"Very interesting what EA has done. For the first time that I recall, a expansion pack is not offered on its own and in a separate box. EA would never do this with The SIMS2. In this case, EA either lets you digitally download Simcity Socieities: Destinations or you can buy it in the new Simcity Box. Now granted you would think that The Simcity Box would include all the Simcity games from the original to the present one; Simcity Socieites (along with the expansion). This is not the case. Those people who already own Simcity Societies will have to either digitally download Destinations or buy Th Simcity Box. For those people who don't own Simcity 4000 and its expansion, Rush Hour, this is a great deal. You got to wonder what EA was thinking.

In the Simcity Box you get Simcity Societies, its expansion Destinations, Simcity 4 and its expansion Rush Hour, SimCarnival: SnapCity, and the trial version of Spore creator creator. All for $[...]. As I said before, if you don't own Simcity 4 and Simcity Socieites, this is a great deal. If you do, then it's best that you get the digital download version of Simcity Societies: Destinations on EA's website. Strangely it's $[...] which is a pretty hefty price for a expansion ($[...] less than the Simcity Box). Those who don't trust the digital download will buy this. So people will just pay the extra $[...] and buy the Simcity Box. Still, not a lot of choices given by EA.

In the Simcity Box, the highlight is Simcity Socieities: Destinations which is the first expansion for the new series; Simcity Socieites. Remember that Tilted Mill had thrown out everything that was built from Simcity (the original) to Simcity 4 and its expansion Rush Hour. Very bold move. Unfortunately, Simcity Societies angered a lot of people and Simcity diehards were very ticked off. Casual gamers liked it as well as others. In Destinations, it includes all of the updates (total of 5) that tried to increase the playability and fix the bugs. The overall meaning of Destinations was to create a vacation destinatation. This I thought was very intriguing. It was unique and would certainly help Simcity Societies to try to win back the Simcity Franchise diehards and try something new. Tilted Mill certainly tried something new at the beginning.

In Destinations more scenarios were added (although not many) ranging in difficulty. You were charged to create either a small vacation destination to a huge Las Vegas type of vacation megaplex. If you choose not to play a scenario you can either play in a sandbox mode where you are free to create and have everything unlocked, to a strategy mode where you have to be mindful of your building costs, maintenance, and unhappy sims which can create havoc on both your city and funds. The strategy mode was an update after Simcity Socieites shipped, so if you gave up on Simcity Socieities you missed the update. However it is included on Destinations. As I stated before, all the updates are included within the expansion Destinations. If you don't want to play in strategic mode, you can choose the difficulty, what type of land you want and how it might look (look at the preview screen). Do you want a desert, tropical, tropical coast land area? You also can pick up to three special landmarks that can have an effect on your tourism which also would effect your city coffers. Cha-ching! Cha-ching! Your main task in Destinations is to create a destination worthy that will attract SimVacationers. Will you build a beach resort? Las Vegas type of vacation spot? Will it have casinos? Minigolf? Motels? Shops? Tents for camping grounds? If you have accomodations for your tourists, you must have venues which are split up into adventure, dining, entertainment, gaming, leisure, and worship.  Which kind of tourist do you want to attract? Can you satisfy all of them?The expansion adds taxistops, bustops, subways, airports, and seaports. Remember, how are your tourists going to get to your vacation spot? This is an exciting new perspective within Simcity Societies and brings in some much needed new content. Now for the bad:

Frustrating! Unfortunately, none of the bugs were fixed. The different socitiet values can be too much and it's very vague concerning their importance or why there are here in the first place. I've mixed a few including, spiritual, authortarian, and productivity; nothing happened either in a bad or good way. In other words, what's the point? The graphics of the buildings were nice. Yes, they produce that, or help this, but so what. Again what's the point. If I placed a few buildings that put me in the red, then I just added buildings that add value until I was in the green. In City Life, some of the social values couldn't live near each other. The game gets very slow when you build up your city. The graphics are very nice however, when the sims cross the street, they turn into invisible lines and reappear when they reach the other side....very wierd! The manual included within the Simcity Box on Destinations is not good in explaining all the new ideas and added goodies within it. The frustration factor is still present even when you want to create a vacation destination. A tutorial would of been nice for Destinations. There is none. The only tutorial that is present is the one for Simcity Socieites and even that one is very incomplete, vague, and not as helpful as Simcity 4 and Simcty 4: Rush Hour was. I wish that there was a type of helper that can guide you to help you move along and give you pointers. **WHEN YOU START A NEW CITY, IT'S LIKE YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN AND GOOD LUCK, which I think a lot of people will feel when playing this game. In Simcity4 you had the advisors. While they weren't a great help, they had decent advice. It would be nice to create parking lots, parking structures, malls, shopping centers, putting in parking meters (for revenue and the addition of a new character in your city- the always warmly greeted ticket agent---cough cough :-) It would be nice to walk or drive around your city either as a civilian, a police officer, a fireman, a mailman, or a tourist. If you walk around as the mayor, will you be greeted with handshakes or tomatoes? One thing I really miss is what I enjoyed in Simcity 4: Rush Hour concerning building up your transportation network. I would of loved to be able to have an effect on traffic control either directing traffic if there was an accident, power outage, or construction, and/or creating traffic flow using the traffic signals. The one thing I hated in Simcity 4: Rush Hour was how bland the traffic signals were and at times it looked like cars were stopping at a red light while others didn't. Controlling traffic would be an awesome feature. It would be nice to be able to place stop signs, street signs, signs in general, traffic lights (single or multiple), and turn signals. I also miss one-way streets as well as avenues. It would be refreshing to see your police keeping the peace and pulling over cars that are not following the traffic and parking rules. I would be nice to see cars parking, and entering and exiting driveways and parking lots and/or parking on the street. How about the possibility of you being voted out as mayor? Will the city council loose faith in you? Does Parliament give you the boot? Are you being investigated for taking bribes and/or kickbacks? Will the people keep you in office? If you are booted, you can become the new mayor but you have to change your policies and try a different root. If you get booted again, game over! How about a weather and natural disaster engine that is random. Earthquakes, severe thunderstorms, hurricanes, and tornadoes that can hurt and destroy; forcing you to send out the police to keep the peace, fire engines to stop the fires, rescue vehicles to tend to the injured or killed, and then set out to rebuild. I would of loved to have more city policies (Simcity 4 had more).

There were some good things within the new expansion but the game still is frustrating and still needs quite a bit more content and bug fixes. Then, just maybe all will be forgiven. I still haven't given up hope. Sadly, when I play Destinations, I'm not on it that long because it's just too frustrating and not as fun as Simcity 4. I get all happy thinking what kind of destination am I going to create, then it fades.

SnapCity is bad although it might be appealing for kids. Anyone who doesn't have Simcity 4 and Simcity Societies should get this, it's a good value. Simcity Socieites has improved but there is still more room for improvement. If it blended City Life, Simcity 4, and Simcity Societies together, then it could of gotten the seal of approval of most Simcity diehards. I've been playing Simcity since the original, and I still have hope that Tilted Mill will improve it. For now, Simcity Societies is still a letdown. While not as bad when it first was released in November, it still needs some work. Maybe this is practice for Tilted Mill. I would love to see this game go DirectX10 (or the new DX11). I would also love to see a city management game that would blow even the Sims and Civilization franchises away.

Something to look forward to is the upcoming release of Cities XL. I've played the demo and so far it's way better than Simcity Societies and mixes both City Life and SC4k with a multiplayer (hybrid MMORPG) aspect to it. I've preordered it. If amazon doesn't sell it, I'll somehow put a review of it on here. Im posting this because city-building fans should watch Cities XL. It's got some kinks but it has a great tutorial- something ScSocities was missing. It's even more fun that it lol. No, I don't work for the company that makes Cities XL. I'm just saying this to spread the word for people who were disappointed in SimCity Socieities. Something to look forward to :)

Update:

While Cities XL seems slightly unfinished, when I was in the forums adding what I would like to see in it, the developers were mentioning that the ideas I was listing are on the list for later updates and expansions. The graphics are gorgeous on Cities XL. The system requirements are steep. You need a pretty powerful video card also. I wish Cities XL was offered on Amazon, I would write a review. Im playing it more than SC4k. I would say that it's a small notch below SC4k however, any updates and/or expansions would go above and beyond. Basically, if Cities XL adds a ""Rush Hour"" type of expansion, it would be sooooo much better than SC4k. Likewise, if SC4k had the graphics from Cities XL, oh how beautiful it would be :) Email me if you'd like to know more about Cities XL before you buy it. Oh and no, I don't work for anything related to Cities XL lol. Im a big fan of city building simulation/business sims and strategies.",Nice try but not good. I prefer Cities XL!

First,

I was able to shoot enemies through doors.  On one part I just walked through the door and backed back through and let the door shut.  The enemies came to the door and I could see their head through the door and shot them.  I was at one section were I shot multiple enemies through the cover they were behind.  This happened in many places.

Second,

The enemies are dumb.  They will run out in front of you a lot and just stand there for a few seconds while you wipe them out.

Third,

The game is not very challenging even on the highest setting.  With the dumb AI and the ability to get enemies in situations were you can shoot them through the doors and the walls/objects it take some challenge away.

Lastly,

The online is not near as good as i was hearing or expected.  I have never experienced connection problems with any other game or even when downloading games and software.  But i played online for a while and noticed that you could unload 2 clips into another player as they charged in for a melee kill with one hit.  I caught on and tried it and sure enough.  Just charge in and melee and you will 9 times out of 10 win.

That is what i thought was wrong with the game.  Now, for what i liked.

I thought the controls were pretty good and responded very well.  The graphics are not bad at all and things look like they are suppose to with the detail needed to make things out.  The story isn't to bad if you like this kind of story.  And the enemies keep coming, out of the portals so you are forced to push forward and close them, or out of egg pods that you have destroy to stop the growth of new enemies.  And although the problems above were apparent I still enjoyed the game as it was fun and the online can be fun with friends.

It can therefore flop about a bit when you move your head.

Additionally, unlike the Sony headset, the clip on this cannot be removed or swapped over to the other side, so the headset MUST be used in your right ear. This means, of course, that you can't swap ears during long gaming sessions to prevent fatigue or long-term discomfort.

Developed by Monolith studios and released in 2005, F.E.A.R.'s story revolves around a Special Forces team who investigates and contains paranormal phenomena. You play as a new but nameless member of the F.E.A.R. team called in to eliminate a cannibalistic killer named Paxton Fettel who controls an army of cloned supersoldiers. After Fettel seizes control of a technology corporation building and murders all inside it's up to the F.E.A.R. team to capture or eliminate him by any means necessary. Here are my thoughts on F.E.A.R.;

Pros

+ Excellent gunplay mechanics and guns are a lot of fun to shoot.

+ Clever and well done A.I.. Enemies flank, duck, cover, vault objects and work as a team to eliminate you.

+ Save anytime, anywhere.

+ Supports a good amount of Widescreen resolutions.

+ Great graphics for a 2005 title.

+ Bullet Time/Slow-Mo was extremely well done.

Cons <Contains SPOILERS>

- Extremely repetitive and bland environments. Endless trudging through sewers, office buildings, steam tunnels, construction sites, warehouses and labs.

- Rather limited number of enemy types.

- Convoluted story that's easily forgotten. All you need to remember is there's a p*ssed off paranormal girl trying to kill you.

- Not really scary at all. Scares are quickly diminished when you begin to receive communication interference, heralding something spooky is going to happen. Really cuts down the eerie tension factor of the game.

- Enemy banter and cursing become repetitive and annoying.

- Lackluster and uninspired score fails to add to the overall environment of the game.

- No real challenging boss fights, just a few tougher mobs from time to time.

- Checkpoint Saves black out and pause your screen for several seconds.

- Lone Wolf approach that your team directs is completely unnecessary. Often you're not even separated yet they tell you to go ahead on your own. Why?

- Predictable and bland ending.

In the end F.E.A.R. was disappointing. Perhaps I was expecting more because of all the media this game received when it was released and the fact they just released F.E.A.R. 3. I was especially let down in the little to no scares the game failed to produce. I've played plenty of Survival Horror type games and F.E.A.R. didn't deliver anything new. One of my other big gripes with the game is the continuous and repetitive environments which made the game go on and on. F.E.A.R. had a few fun moments and the gunfights were often fast and frantic but by the end I was glad the game was over.","F.E.A.R. = F.P.S. that's sometimes good, but never great",1317686400,,,

-- Original review --
I have endured through 2 Battlefield games - BF2 and Bad Company 2.  And while the standard and bar was set by BF2, some of the things that were in Bad Company 2 were also perfect.  My play style is infantry but I do not mind sitting in armor.  Having spent 200+ hours in a tank in BF2, I got used to the feel of how a tank can be used, both offensively and defensively.  Bad Company 2 changes that to make it more risky to get into a tank.  While this is a setback for some, I also do not mind it.

Battlefield 3 came with tons of high expectations.  For me, multi-monitor support is one of those expectations.  Out of the box, it worked, but certain display elements were not positioned correctly.  It made telling the difference between friend and foe a lot harder, because I cannot see what's what.  That was soon fixed up in the first major update to the game.

One of the biggest annoyance is how it requires Origin to play.  As a Steam user, I do not mind launching the game from there.  However, BF3 is now designed to be launched from within your web browser, rather than Origin.  That makes me question as to why Origin is even needed in the first place.  I would have been perfectly fine if it had some other ""protection"" schemes with it.  But to require Origin to even play is downright stupid when the game is literally launched from the web browser instead.  Requiring Origin to run in the background only makes life worse for those with limited memory or CPU resources.

The game mechanic is perhaps the biggest pain in the rear and at the same time one of the greatest thing so far.  All weapons have a set of unlocks for which you can use to enhance your weapon according to your play style.  Yet at the same time, this introduced a set of ""standards"" for which 90% of the player population uses.  One of the bigger debatable unlock is the IRNV scope that makes differentiating friend and foe almost instantaneous.  It also facilitate seeking out well-hidden players who lie in wait for an opportunity.  Even crazier is the fact that you can add a suppressor to a light machine gun, turning any LMG into an air-soft sounding weapon.  While the idea and concept was nice, the whole system needs to be reworked.

Another major pain in the rear is how the vehicles are now designed.  All vehicles can take a major pounding regardless of what you're in.  You could be riding a bicycle and take a direct RPG hit and still walk away safely.  That is how bad the vehicles are designed now.  A M1 Abrams or T-90 MBT can take 3 rockets up the rear end and still live to shoot a tank shell at you.  And I ask: WHY???  I distinctively recall that any 3 anti-tank rockets can guarantee a kill whether if it's in BF2 or Bad Company 2.  If you believe it was that difficult to get rid of an armor raising hell, there's even an unlock upgrade for it called ""Reactive Armor"" that makes your tank even tougher.  I ask again: WHY????

DICE has put together a nice game.  But it's plagued by so many things it isn't even funny.  There is something wrong when you end up spawning as an Engineer class more than 50% of the time.  And there are 4 distinct classes to choose from too: Assault/Medic, Support, Engineer, and Recon/Sniper.  So if more than half the population spawn in as engineer just to prepare for any vehicle, then this game has serious balance issues right there.

I am currently torn between hating and loving this game.  The whole vehicle system was practically perfect in Bad Company 2 because a squad of 4 can effectively take out a variety of vehicles.  BF3 throws all that out the window, requiring half a team to come in as engineer to effectively neutralize any ground vehicle threat.  But wait, there's more.  Don't even get me started on how overpowered the mobile anti-air tank is.  I've used it and even I can say that it's ridiculously overpowered.

Verdict: I don't know.  Flip a coin and surprise me.
----- Dec 7 Update Addendum:
Several changes were made and the update is rather large.  This is because the contents for the Back to Karkand 'expansion' is included with this update.  DICE, the developers, has yet to figure out how to deliver a game update w/o the need of requiring extraneous content that the player will not be able to access.  This is a minor blemish to me, but others with limited download bandwidth and data consumption will not like it.  I'll leave it at that for now.

Two of the biggest gameplay changes that has been hotly debated is the ""tactical"" light and the IRNV scope attachments, polar opposites to each other.  As a IRNV user, I can see the difference it made from its changes.  Its implementation is poorly executed.  They now introduced what I call a ""fake fog"" but its effect seems to be less seen on night maps such as Tehran Highway.  On daylight maps, this fake fog is heavily visible and there is a momentary delay of the scope ""adjusting"" to the light changes.  While this is somewhat a welcome change, it felt that they are trying to discourage its use rather than promoting what it should be used for.  This may force some people to change their scope option to something else.  But even then, it is already difficult to see enemies as well as friendlies.

Other changes seems to include on how the Javelin rockets work and its damage seems to be increased by a noticeable amount.  For targets that are painted by a laser designator, such as the SOFLAM, the Javelin rocket now home in on the vehicle and causes significant damage.  Helicopters can now be taken down in a single Javelin shot if it has been painted.  Armors are now disabled in a single shot.  But despite its much needed damage increase, it still requires a line of sight to lock on to the target and launch.  Such requirement will expose any Javelin users out into the open.

One of the downside to the update is the change in how long AT mines live after the person is killed.  Before, there would be no limit as to how many AT mines can be out at once.  This creates wonderful opportunities to form barriers that vehicles must cross in order to advance.  Now these mines no longer live when the player dies.  I rather much prefer if there was a defined maximum number of AT mines that can be out at once.  Thus, if more are deployed then the earliest one would simply disappear.  This is how AT mines worked in Bad Company 2, where a player can die but not have to worry about redeploying the mines due to limited lifespan.  They are there until they are forcibly detonated or when a vehicle passes by them.

Through word of mouth, it seems there are tweaks to the AN-94 weapon, making it more useful in combat situation unlike before.  I have yet to play with this weapon although I can vouch for its sub-par performance compared to other weapons.

There were many other changes that I have yet to mention.  It seems that they are slowly making changes and trying to improve on what they have.  However, I feel that it isn't enough of a change.  The verdict still stands for now.

You are a photographer, and have been hired by Professor Oak to document Pokemon living in the wild. You ride through levels on a fixed track, snapping photos. You have a few items at your disposal to help spur the Pokemon into different actions, which racks up better photos and more points. The graphics are somewhat average, but the Pokemon animate well. Controls are easy to master.

So yeah it's very different and very fun, but in the end much too short. You have six levels and a bonus seventh level (that really isn't much of a level), but you see less than half of the original 151 Pokemon. Getting better photos gives the game some replay value, but you can basically see everything in a weekend.

But the combat is not that interesting ultimately.  After some playtime, you will find that character leveling is slow (basically your characters are as good as their equipment in this game).  Even that might be OK but the combat is on a 2D grid in which things like elevation and terrain do no matter at all.  So it is a pretty basic implementation of turn based. What is cool is that everyone moves around on the playfield before every turn and this creates some interesting tactics.  It is not enough though for hundreds and hundreds (no exaggeration) of battles needed to complete the game.

3.0,False,"04 28, 2009",A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B000JHMJDA,Caleb Williams,"I've not played a need for speed game since the utterly brilliant Need for Speed Underground. That game was simply so good, it seemed almost impossible to top. Which is when, the fantastic Need for Speed: Carbon became the first game of the franchise to hit the PS3. What a debut it was as Carbon is sincerely one of the most fun games to be playable on the PS3 in the first few months of its release.

The game itself goes back to its underground routes with the night time racing and different race types that take place in a canyon or on the treacherous mountain roads. These two different racing modes are without a doubt the most fun additions to any series, even ahead of the customisation abilities of the past. The drift races are easily the most fun and something I enjoy more as I've mastered the technique to the point in which I do not touch a wall and end the race with an unimaginable point score (I dare you to challenge me :)

Drag races have been removed but have been replaced by something known as ""canyon duel"" in which you are racing one on one and the goal is to remain as close to your rival as possible during the race. Another new feature within gives you the ability to amass a crew that can be selected to help you win the races, as good as an addition as this is, it becomes almost too much of a help to the point in which the game is very easy to complete.

The visuals are without a doubt stunning, but I couldn't help but be disappointed by the standard considering it's a game of the PS3. The customisation is more detailed than any previous games, giving you the ability to let your imagination run wild. The games plot pits you against 3 separate racing gangs which you must beat in a number of exciting races and challenges in order to progress to the final race. As you progress through the plot, you gain new friends that join your crew and also win some bonus cars as a reward for beating your challenger. I didn't play Most Wanted, but I believe it follows on from that.

Because of the free roaming capability, you can go about particular races or side challenges at your leisure, or if you're bored, you can just speed through the city until you grab the cop's attention and just take chase. The whole combination of the cool race additions such as the duel and the drift, the ability to roam the city at your whim, the capability to develop a crew to help you out and the immense customisation options combined with stunning visuals and a well defined city present an amazingly fun game that anyone can pick up at any time and enjoy.

I would highly recommend this to any casual PS3 gamer. Be warned, however, as the game that followed this was a blatant spit in the face to the series.","Extremely Fun, But Ridiculously Easy",1240876800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

( Which gave the game a 5.7 ) I wasn't expecting too much out of this game, but since I have the Game Pass at Blockbuster, I rented this anyways. This is the story: The Dirty Bubble got pushed into a washer and he turned into a whole lot of small bubbles. It is up to the Yellow Avenger; A.K.A Spongebob; to capture all these buckeroos and save Bikini Bottom. Here's my review.

Graphics: 8/10. These are some really nice cel-shaded graphics. The graphics obviously look better than the DS version of the game, and there are really nice character animations as well, so there is really no problem with the camera angles or doing anything as far as moving around is concerned.

Sound: 6.5/10. I was really dissapointed with the sound. I was expecting to hear voices from the showm but really, the only thing you hear in this game is a little music in the background and the squeaking of Spongebob's boots. It's not too annoying, until you have been playing the game 3 hours straight. That's the time when you turn the volume to mute.

Control: 7.5/10. The control is fine. You can use the D-Pad ( I wouldn't reccomend ) or the analog nub, which makes the moving a lot easier. Most of this game is just a 3D side scroller, except when you walk in places like the Krusty Krab, Spongebob's House, Squidward's Pad, stuff like that. Either way, the control really is not bad at all. You just side scroll left or right and basically just jump around onto platforms, and onto the citizens head's to get the bubbles off. This can be frustrating, though, because sometimes when you jump it may delay or something, or it's really picky as to where exactly you have to land on their head.

Fun: 7/10. Since this game is relatively short, this game is really just an excellent rental. For fans of the series, they should definitely rent this game. It is a decent amount of length for the game ( I've played for three hours and I'ma bout 30% thru the game, but it really depends on how fast you are at games. ) And this would be a great game for kids. The only real problems with this game is just the fact is doesn't have character voices, which was a let down, the chores are tedious and you will have to back track a lot. Chances are, if you know where people live in the show, you will have a better chance of finding what you need. There are 9 different locations to visit around the ""Spongebob World"" including Residents area, the City of Bikini Bottom, Goo Lagoon, Jelly Fish Fields, Rock Bottom, Mrs. Puff's Driving Class, and more. You can also of course interact with favorites from the show, such as Mr. Krab, Pearl Krab, Squidward, Patrick, Sandy, Mrs. Puff, Larry, and even some lesser known characters such as the ""surfer dude"" Scooter, and the police officer Officer Nancy. Like I said, this game is well worth a rental, but not neccesarily a buy.

A radical departure from the rest of the Kingdom Under Fire series, ""Kingdom Under Fire: Circle of Doom"" changes the series from a RTS game with some hack-and-slash elements to a pure hack-and-slash.

First, some history: Kingdom Under Fire started as a PC game that was basically another Warcraft clone. Later, it moved to the Xbox with KUF: Crusaders and KUF: Heroes, which had a really unique system - most of the time it was strategy, used from a third-person perspective from your different platoons, but when you got into melee with your leader's group you would take control of your leader and hack-and-slash your way through the crowd. This helped you win battles that would otherwise find you outmatched.

In Circle of Doom, the series has moved entirely to that Hack-and-Slash mechanic. There are six characters, all of whom are from previous KUF games (4 from the Xbox titles, and 2 from the original PC one). These characters differ in their speed, their strength, and the types of weapons they can use. In the beginning, five characters are available, with one more being unlockable. Their storylines mostly revolve around their disappearances at the end of their respective games - now they are in a new realm, devoid of humans besides themselves. The only characters in the ""real world"" are the three idols that you encounter at rest points. These act as the game's merchants, selling you different gear depending on which idol is there (the bubbly Idol of Love, the dark and shrouded Idol of Death, and the Buddha-like Idol of Greed.) Furthermore, you can fall asleep at rest points, and in your dreams you will be transported to the Realm of Darkness, a subdimension that holds the dead spirits of the game's other characters. These spirits are also recognizable from previous games. They assign quests, teach abilities, and provide general story information. Other than those two minor sources, there is almost no story or interaction in the game.

The gameplay should be at least the redeeming part to the game, but for the most part it's not. Swinging a weapon requires ""SP"", or ""Stamina Points"", which recharge naturally. This means that most of your hack-and-slash actions will be punctuated by waiting for your stamina to recharge. This really takes you out of the game and is downright frustrating most of the time. There are lots of magical abilities to be learned, and this requires not just leveling up but also doing quests (most often ""kill X number of this type of enemy""). For the most part, the gameplay lacks a lot of the combo attacks and excitement that the Xbox games held in their hack-and-slash sections. It's also possible to do a co-op mode with up to four people over Xbox Live, using head

The graphics are without a doubt the game's best part. The characters - friend and foe - are all really detailed and textured, and all the effects are really fantastic. The lighting, especially, looks fantastic. The environments - including a forest, a ruined city, and an underground area - are all rendered impressively, with lots of little details and side parts. Blood - which can be turned on or off - is shown as artistic sprays of color. The music is also very haunting and beautiful, conveying the sense of a dead, empty world. The voice acting isn't great, but it comes up so infrequently that it doesn't matter.

As a whole, this game has a lot going for it (the graphics and the co-op option being the main two) but also a lot more not going for it (the gameplay, the lack of story, the comparison of this game to other KUF games). Even as a hack-and-slash, it's not a whole lot of fun. It seems like a lot of wasted effort on the parts of the development team.

It's sold out everywhere.  Grannies are playing Wii Sports in nursing homes because it's so easy to pick up and play.  But here's what you won't hear -- the Wii is a pitifully outdated piece of junk with one major gimmick (the motion control).  I'd like to see follow-up news stories about the grannies to see whether they still turn the thing on.  I know that mine now mostly collects dust, as do most other Wiis

The defining features of the Wii is its motion control.  Here's the dirty little secret that the fanboys and enthusiastic recent buyers won't tell you: the Wii controls are terrible.  I have played through a lot of games, ranging from the AAA titles like Mario Galaxy and Zelda, to the party games like Mario Party 8 and Wii Sports and I can say this -- motion control is awful.  There is absolutely no precision to it.  If you had dreams of using the Wii-mote realistically like a lightsaber, than forget it. It doesn't facilitate any kind of decent control.  The only game where motion control actually improves the gameplay is Wii Bowling.  In every other game, it's generally an annoyance that is used in gimmicky fashion.  Random button pressing has been replaced with random Wii-mote gesturing.  By the time you have played a game like Zelda or Bully for a few hours, you will be wishing that you could push buttons in lieu of waving your Wii-mote around.  This is why 90% of the software on the Wii is shovelware party games.  This is why the Wii has the lowest ratio of software to hardware sales out of the three major consoles.

Speaking of shovelware, the Wii has by far the worst library of any game console this decade.  Most of what comes out for it is unplayably bad.  There are a few great first party Nintendo titles (which are largely rehashes from prior Nintendo platforms), and a few great third party titles like Bully and Resident Evil 4 that are already available on other systems.  Every multiplatform game that comes out, whether its Madden football, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, Guitar Hero, or a Call of Duty game, puts its worst version on the Wii.  If you don't believe me, then look up the reviews for these games.  The Wii always gets the worst version of every game.  I cannot think of one single exception to this rule.

The reason for the poor Wii software library is that the Wii is nothing mroe than a Gamecube with gimmicky motion controls.  Everything about the technology, like graphics, level size, and loading times, are bad.  The Wii sees none of the recent advances that have improved video games, like realistic physics.  Not only does the Wii not get a good version of multiplatform games, it doesn't get the great games that take advantage of modern technology.  Fallout 3, Grand Theft Auto IV, Mass Effect, Far Cry 2, Dead Space, Left 4 Dead, Assassins Creed, Portal, Half-Life 2.  You cannot play these great games on the Wii.  Want to know why? Because they won't work on the Wii's 2001-esque technology.  You can't get downloadable content for Rock Band on the Wii.  Why? Because it lacks a hard drive.

Two years ago, the price point for the Wii was a major selling point, but now that that PC hardware, the XBox 360, and the PS3 have dropped in price, this is no longer much of an advantage.  You can actually get a barebones XBox 360 for $50 less than a Wii now.

The only people for whom I would recommend this console are:

A:  People with children between the ages of 3 and 10
B:  People who have lots of social gatherings at their house.

The Wii is a good console for children because of the simplicity of the games, and the motion controls do add a certain element of fun when you are playing with other people.  I must say that the times where my in-laws have come over have seen the Wii get a lot of use.  Other than that, not much.  My wife plays the Lego games with me, but you can get that game on other platforms with better graphics.

I bought a Wii about 8 months ago, and I'm thinking about selling it now.  I got some enjoyment out of it, but now I hardly ever turn it on.  The PC provides a much better gaming experience for me, and now I'm considering getting a PS3 or an XBox 360 instead.","Good for parties and children, lousy for everything else",1227225600,7,{'Color:': ' White'},

When it was first announced I was automatically turned off by the fact that it was yet another WWII game.  My friends bought it and said it was fun...so I got a copy.  I wasn't very impressed with the online play.  Going from modern weapons to pea shooters wasn't my idea of fun.  I found a few of the maps too large for 6v6 play and they would be more fitted for 8v8.  Sure they can make smaller maps but the game isn't fun enough to sit around and wait for them.  I noticed that you have to lead your enemy by aiming ahead of them when shooting from 10 feet away (hence the pea shooter remark made earlier).  The tanks are underpowered and shooting  directly next to a guy who is behind a wall won't even kill him (you have to shoot next to him since the TANK can't shoot through buildings or trees but some guns can).  The respawn points in COD5 are the worst I've seen since Rainbow Six Vegas 2. Even though I didn't enjoy the MP that much I actually had fun playing campaign co-op.  I tried to go back and play the game again but wasn't able to play more than 15 minutes.  So with the not so good replay value of the SP and MP modes I gave this game a three.  Since I've been watching a lot Killzone 2 videos I can't bring myself to play much of anything these days and COD5 was supposed to be my 'filler game' until Killzone 2 comes out.

Unfortunately, Assassin's Creed 3 falls short in pretty much every department. It's not a bad game, and there are a handful of positive additions... but it's a little pathetic to see it fail to meet the standards set even by AC2's expansion games.

The biggest flaw is definitely that the game feels woefully untested. AC3 on the PC has a ridiculous number of bugs, from epileptic horses to menu freezes that make it impossible to proceed, and I've been encountering them in virtually every mission and quite often while just running around. There are also a lot of bewildering things that somehow made it past playtesting; I was killing bears with a hidden blade that was apparently coming out of my bare arm for quite a while before the plot got around to letting me have it, and at one point I was wandering around and completely by accident captured a British Templar fort, which replaced the flag and all the troops there with American revolutionaries... in 1770. In-game tooltips display at very weird moments, like a prompt telling you how to lower your notoriety at a time in the game when none of the methods described are available to you, and every cinematic has a prompt saying ""PRESS E TO SKIP"" plastered across the corner for the duration. It's not just software bugs, basically - this game feels like it was never tested.

That extends to the writing, too. I'm not far in enough to make a definitive statement about the plot, but it looks like the story level is still reasonably in line with the series' quality so far... but the script is just horrific. Scenes just drag on, especially in the very beginning, with voice actors doing their best with lines like ""what's true and what is aren't always the same."" And it's not just dialog that's a problem, either; the story structure and pacing are badly out of whack. We're given no reason to care about any of the characters until several missions into the game, and when we do finally meet our protagonist, our introduction to him is watching several scenes of mediocre voice actors monotone their way through extremely lengthy speeches in Mohawk. (I can't express how bad the Mohawk acting is, it's literally like hearing someone reading a technical manual.)

Gameplay itself isn't nearly so problematic, but still suffers badly from a lack of thorough testing. The developers made a big deal about the ability to pick up weapons on the fly, but I had trouble picking them up even standing completely still with no enemies around. The new lockpicking minigame is a perfect storm of unnecessary, no fun and unreasonably picky about precise mouse movement. I had problems constantly with getting stuck on the end of beams unable to move forward, having to realign to the precise right angle to climb certain objects, and attempting to climb impassable barriers that are completely indistinguishable from climbable surfaces. Lip syncing frequently turned into muppet-style flapping with no connection whatsoever to the sound (sometimes not even opening their mouths during dialog at all). Elites deflect attacks and counterattacks pretty much 100% of the time, which makes combat pretty repetitive (counterattack grunts, disarm then attack elites... every time). Several of the optional mission objectives are almost impossible to understand unless you've already played the level once. It's just rough, basically. The difficulty is a huge mess - I had no trouble taking on entire forts simultaneously from the very beginning of the game, but failed other missions constantly thanks to pointlessly capricious layouts for stealth sequences and unpredictable cutoff points for achieving secondary objectives. Even the historical hooks are pretty lackluster, and none of the characters are particularly interesting. And it's been painfully obvious for a few installments that they didn't plan for Kristen Bell's leaving the series, and they've made no effort whatsoever to fill the gap in the narrative left by her character. One entire component of the game (the economic/crafting system) is only usable with an XBox controller and will freeze if you so much as move the mouse. Almost everything about the game feels like a rough draft, basically.

It's not all bad news, of course. The new naval sequences are outstanding. Graphically the game looks pretty great, and the new weather system is attractive (especially localized effects like fog). The nature areas look particularly good (and are massive!), which was a wise decision - colonial America was perhaps not the best choice for this series, considering its lack of gorgeous, huge landmark buildings to climb on, but the game seems to be making up for that by going for knockout natural environments instead. Although a lot of the previous installments' RPG elements are gone, the new hunting system is pretty engaging. Animation's enjoyed some high-quality additions too, especially the run cycle and a whole slew of fancy new combat flash. The world is enormous, there's a ton of stuff to play around with and climb on. And I actually did find a couple (non-mandatory) minigames that were surprisingly fun, where you play old-timey board games in taverns.

Overall, though, I'd only really recommend this game to people who are already in love with the series. It does a reasonable job of bringing us more of the free-running madness that made the first several games so much fun, so it's a good buy just to give you more stuff to climb around on once Italy starts feeling a little too familiar... but it really doesn't stand up well on its own.

Pros:
-Excellent and exhilirating naval combat
-Very attractive, albeit not (ahem) revolutionary
-Pretty much anything you do out in the woods is great
-Highly cinematic combat
-The engine can support huge numbers of NPCs simultaneously (crowds are, well, crowded)
-It is still pretty fun, when everything's working

Cons:
-Mediocre story editing and script, very poor story pacing
-Absolutely overrun with software bugs and continuity errors
-Combat, while beautifully choreographed, is essentially a combination of a reflex test and rock-paper-scissors
-Possibly the worst mandatory lockpicking minigame ever made (it's not nearly as bad with a controller, but it's maddening with a mouse, and purposeless either way)
-The setting is not well-suited to the more appealing gameplay elements
-There's a well-documented bug that completely prevents you from progressing past a certain point without an XBox controller, which wasn't fixed in the recent patches.

The arcade game was awesome and probably the most addicting and fun of all the fighting games out at the time.  But this home console version always felt lacking.  Nintendo redid all the endings, many of the fatalities look cheap and nothing like the arcade version.  All the 3D elements are gone this is a straight up 2D fighter.

It kind of reminded me of Virtua Fighter for the Sega Genesis a 3D game that was ported over badly to a 2D console.  Now KI on the SNES is a much better game than VF on the Genesis but both titles never lived up to the pure fun of the arcade versions.  I always disliked seeing the bodies spinning once you knock them off a building or platform and then bounce like a bouncy ball once they hit bottom.  Kind of a cheap stupid effect.

Simple cosmetic details like frost coming off Glacius or flames sparking off of Cinder are not present.  Besides Eyedol's ending most of the games endings seem cheaply done.  You do not get both the Eyedol death scenes like in the arcade game just a simple redone version of him falling to his death.  You can play as Eyedol which is a cool feature and it is similar to the arcade where you can continue as many times as you want, none of this set number of lives BS like in the MK games.  All the characters made it to the home console and are fun to play so the core gameplay experience is still there.  Nintendo did get all the combo moves in the game which was one of the games biggest highlights.

Overall KI has not really aged well on this system.  The true replay value comes into play when you play against your friends head to head.  Beating the computer will get old rather quickly.  I would rate the game 3 1/2 stars.  It is definitely one of the best fighting games on the SNES but I would not rate it higher than SF2, or MK2 which remain more faithful to the arcade console experience.  I bought this when it first came out for $75 at Toys R Us store.  It should be about $10 to $20 definitely not worth more than that there are much better games out there for your money and time or find the original arcade version its great.

3.0,False,"11 4, 2015",A13BTMCSLTQ48R,B0026EV5FW,Llama Mama,"I did not have high hopes for this one. The general consensus among ND fans is that this game is one of the worst titles in the series. Still, I wanted to give it a try. Once again the fans knew best. I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.

PLOT - 3/5: The plot in this game was fairly ingenious. Nancys BFF Bess wins a trip for three to an island in the Bahamas called Dread Isle. Apparently not alarmed at the islands ominous name, Bess invites George and Nancy to join her. Nancy arrives a day later than Bess and George and when she gets there she discovers that Bess has gone missing. She soon learns that Bess is being held for ransom as part of an elaborate scheme. Kidnappers lured Nancy and her friends to the island in order to force Nancy to find a centuries old treasure that is supposedly buried there.

It was definitely unnerving to think that someone had been stalking Nancy and would extort her in that way. Also, the story surrounding the buried treasure was very interesting. So while I would give this plot an A+ for effort, I could only give it a C for execution. What this game desperately needed was that creepy Im being watched feeling as Nancy clomps around the island for clues. Instead, its easy to forget that Bess is in danger or that Nancy is working against the clock as Nancy goes about her usual detective business with cheerful tropical music playing in the background. When Nancys friend Maya was kidnapped in The Final Scene, Nancy was affected by it for the entirety of the game. In this game, George was the only one who really seemed upset that Bess was missing.

Worst of all, this game was boring. It was hard to motivate myself to play it and it took me a little under a month to beat the game.

CHARACTERS - 1/5:  The only two characters you see in this game are Nancys friend George and a bum/fisherman named Johnny. Well theres the parrot, Coucou, but I wouldnt count her as a character.  I really don't know what Her Interactive was thinking putting in just two characters. They succeeded in making the island desolate if thats what they were going for. I think that the lack of characters was a huge part in what made this game so boring. George was not interesting at all (which is weird because shes always fun as a phone friend) and I didn't care for Johnny either. The voice acting was bad  especially Johnnys as he was voiced by an actor that is really overused by Her Interactive. And as I said earlier, you never get the feeling like you are being watched by the kidnappers so rather than the island feeling spooky and remote it only feels lonely and lame.  This is the lowest score Ive ever given to a cast of characters in a ND game, but man this game really deserves it.

SETTING  3/5: The setting was nice. The graphics were good and there was a lot to explore. I didn't care much for the music and thought that it was odd that the sand was so pink. What was really annoying was that it was incredibly time consuming to get Nancy around the island.  On land Nancy is stuck in the worlds slowest golf cart and going over roads that are ridiculously winding, not to mention it was hard to remember where everything was. In the water, she has a sailboat that is tricky to navigate and not much faster than the golf cart. It was obvious that these things were put in to waste time and make the game longer. It had me longing for the old days were you just clicked on your destination and Nancy fast traveled there.

PUZZLES  3.5/5: The puzzles were probably the strongest aspect of this game. Unfortunately that isn't saying much. But the puzzles were creative and didn't seem to be reused from older games. All of the puzzles are laid out in the journal of El Toro, captain of the Seven Ships, and so Nancy just has to decipher his clues and then go around the island solving the puzzles. It was very similar to the journal in The Curse of Blackmoor Manor. I really don't like when they do that. Knowing everything that I have to do ahead of time just makes it feel like a chore list, rather than going out and finding the puzzles over the course of the story.

IS IT CHALLENGING?  Probably. I wouldnt really know because I used a walkthrough for 99% of it. I was not really feeling this game and didn't have the drive to figure out all of those puzzles. I would give it a 3.5 for challenge.

ENDING  3.5/5: Hmmm. The ending for this one was simultaneously good and bad. I liked who they chose as the culprit and I liked their motives, but I was left feeling kind of disappointed about the whole thing. I remember hearing someone say once that they loved the ending to Ransom of the Seven Ships but that an ending like that should have been in a better game. Thats how I feel about it, too. But kudos to Her Interactive for thinking outside the box with this ending.

When I bought the game, it came on 5 CDs with a little instruction sheet full of misleading information. You will have to install a program called ""Steam"" which will then allow you to register Half-Life 2 online - THIS IS MANDATORY, THE UNREGISTERED GAME WILL NOT WORK!!

  By the way, you have to first find the CD key, pick it out from all the other text that is printed near it then remember to register with steam correctly the first time...OR ELSE YOU ARE SCROOMED (Scr#@ed and Doomed at the same time). But don't worry, if you lock up the game you can always get a replacement CD key in 6 TO 8 WEEKS! I tried e-mailing Valve/Steam; A computer responded: ""The CD key is invalid."" WRONG, the supplied instructions were incorrect and I was able to register Half-Life 2 after 3 HOURS of frustration.

  In contrast, it took me 30 minutes to set up Pariah, the new Prince of Persia game and Republic Commando. The bad news is that you better get used to this nonsense.

The puzzles are pretty intuitive and not very challenging at all.  There really isn't a whole lot of brain power required here, save for one or two puzzles which seem completely out of sync with the simplicity of the rest of the game.

Example; most of your time playing as Indiana Jones you're jumping around or brawling with bad guys.  You occasionally have to jump or use your whip, but you're otherwise in a Nintendo like game, and not something that involves a little more thought or cleverness.  Compare that with Infernal Machine where you had to puzzle out a few things to get doors to open and such.  I spent a few weeks finishing Infernal Machine.  This game I finished in a few days.

The story is decent enough, but the ""realism"" of the game suffers from the same shortcoming of Infernal Machine;; and that is the guns in the game just don't feel like guns from the films; but that could be the Military FPS gamer in me talking.  I was also highly dissapointed that you couldn't buy equipment like the previous game, and that there were few or no wild animals to make life interesting.

The controls are a little wonky, and the camera goes wild if you're in a tight space, but otherwise it's playable.  It's an okay installment to the Indy Jones series.  Overall I think it's okay.  It's more of a game for the console gaming set than the PC crowd.

3.0,False,"04 29, 2008",A1UULJW6V2ERBP,B000XJNTNS,Scott Stoddard,"I should give this game a two star review, but since I am a nintendo (and especially Mario Kart) loyalist I gave it an extra star.  I waited forever for this game to finally come to the Wii and now I have to say that it will probably end up being one of many games I have traded in almost immediately to salvage what little return I can get on the game.  Here is why...

I feel this is the first Mario Kart that has taken a step back.  From each other release on the three other consoles, there has been improvement.  Game Cube was by far the best in terms of play control and overall fun.  The Wii has taken a step back in time or maybe a step towards making it a game that everyone can play because skill is no longer really allowed in this game.  The driving has taken second seat to the demolition derby that is now Mario Kart.  There isn't a single race that I haven't been blasted by at least three of the following:  POW, blue shell, red shells, ink, and lightning.  The extent of actual driving in Mario Kart shouldn't be called driving, it should be called recovering.  I think the best bet is to get a car with rapid acceleration because you won't be at top speed for long and when you are wiped out, you come to a COMPLETE STOP.  It makes me long for the game cube days where, with enough practice, we could dodge (yes I said dodge) red shells (and if with a little luck thrown in, blue shells) without the aid of dropping something behind you.  Slide turns have been turned in to something completely ridiculous.  It is no longer an expert set of motions on the analog stick that allows for a rapid boost of speed, it is whatever preset skills they have given to the kart your driving and the ability to pass time waiting for you kart to pick up speed.  I also haven't decided if I am a fan of the boost that can be obtained while doing tricks while going off of jumps.  I also play with the Game Cube controller.  I found the play with the Wii wheel to be absolutely horrible.  I will say that it is kind of cool to be able to turn the car like you are actually driving it, but if you want to win the races with any kind of regularity you should probably opt for the old school style of racing.

I will say that there are some features of this game that I like.  I do like all of the new courses.  Nintendo has never been at a loss for making up new and interesting courses.  However, when including old courses, am I the only one that thinks they really didn't pick the best of the bunch?  And, why couldn't they have included all of the old courses?

I also like that there are more ways to attack your opponents during the race.  It was time that a couple of new things were added.  However, I come back to the fact, that with twelve racers, it is impossible to really race.  And, since most of these things are completely unavoidable, it seems like I am playing to recover most of the time.

I am sure that I could go on complaining about how this game isn't all I had hoped for, but I think I will leave with just one more complaint.  Does it make any sense not to drive with a character that isn't huge anymore?  All the karts that the larger characters can drive come with comparable speeds and accelerations to all the little kart drivers but with the added benefit that you can completely drive through all of the little drivers.  It makes no sense to be a small driver anymore.  It's like watching a 500 lb. man wrestle a 50 lb. midget.

But, my brother does like playing it.  So, maybe I am the only one that feels this is a step back.  Yet, I don't have the desire to invite all my friends over every weekend for round after round of mario kart where the races were decided by the best drivers and their abilities to use and avoid special items and not by the racer who happens to be lucky enough to recover or avoid or be hit with whatever at the exact right time to go limping across the finish line in front of everyone else.

I think the bottom line I have learned from all of the video games I have eagerly anticipated and reserved in advance is this: rent, rent, rent, rent!  Then I will avoid the catastrophes that were assassin's creed, mario kart, two worlds, etc.

But I will probably be in the minority here, and maybe we will get lucky and see another (improved) mario kart for the Wii before the next system is released.",Demolition Kart,1209427200,16,,

Mario Tennis Open is a simple game. It's basically a tennis game with Super Mario characters in it such as Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, Bowser, etc. It also features different courses based on the Super Mario series as well. Although, these don't really separate it from a traditional tennis game unfortunately.

Each character has a different skill, making each character unique in their own way. You can choose to use your own Mii character to play in tennis matches too, but they don't have any unique powers or advantages over other characters. The only way to customize them and make them ""better"" are to go to the shop and purchase gear. You can purchase gear from the shop after being awarded coins from playing each game mode. You can receive costumes too, but these are only obtained by fulfilling certain objectives.

You can play multiplayer either online or locally, which allows four people to play simultaneously on their own individual 3DS'. If you have StreetPass enabled and you pass someone that also has StreetPass enabled, you can play against a computer that mimics the play style of that other person (as long as that other person actually has the game).

There isn't much to say about this game, but I wish there was more to it. There is the main mode that puts you in a tournament against other computers with the goal being for you to finish at the top. There is also a couple little game modes like hitting the tennis balls spit by the black Piranha Plants and hitting the ball through golden rings, but that's it. What I don't like is the obsessive ""grinding"" (as I'll call it) that you have to in order to fully complete this game. You're going to be playing each tournament with each character for hours upon hours if you want to complete this game 100%.

The Final Verdict:
I'm just disappointed in knowing that the same developer (Camelot) has been developing almost all of the games in the series including this one and they couldn't come up with some better ideas to make the replay value of this game have a stronger presence. I know that in the end, it's just a basic tennis game, but you would think they would add more to it, especially considering the fact that they have the whole character set from Super Mario Bros. and all of its other materials. If you're just getting a 3DS/2DS, go purchase a better game for just starting out such as The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D or Kid Icarus: Uprising. Come back to this game when the price of it gets lowered.

3.0,False,"03 9, 2009",A2Q2A6JKY95RTP,B001ASJIS6,Raul G.,"Having thoroughly enjoyed every Prince of Persia game on home consoles since ""The Sands of Time"" I was eagerly anticipating playing the PS3 iteration of the series. That said this new ""PoP"" game is a huge disappointment.

First though I have to comment on what I liked. The graphics are intensely bright, colorful and simply beautiful. There are many moments where I just paused and looked around enjoying the scenery. Character models, boss characters and animated sequences are also equally well done. The graphics use a style called cell-shading which gives the game a more ""cartoonish"" look than previous games. However, the new style fits the ""PoP"" setting perfectly and I felt that it actually complimented the series better than previous efforts.

Prince of Persia also succeeds in being somewhat less linear than previous games. Now once the Prince meets up with Princess Elika the player is given almost free reign to explore the world around them. It's not quite an ""sandbox"" experience a la GTA but more like maps connected by passages. Every area is also displayed on an easy to access map for navigation. Certain areas also require the player to upgrade Elika's abilities before full exploration can be accomplished.

Unfortunately that's where the good parts end and the game starts to show it's flaws. First and foremost in my opinion the biggest single issue I have with Prince of Persia is the repetitive nature. Every area has a set level of maps to explore which require a set number of ""Lights Orbs"" to be collected in order to upgrade Elika's powers. Since the player begins the quest with no powers you'll end up doing quite a lot of backtracking. Every new power you do acquire will open up new areas for full exploration but after only a few hours this type of mindless gameplay becomes boring.

Another issue is that Prince of Persia is a game without consequences. The game will not let you fail as your partner, Elika has the power to save you from any and all circumstances. Because of that the game loses it's edge. Boss fights become a button mashing mindless mess. Missing jumps or simply sacrificing your character in order to reach an out of the way Light Orb have no penalty. Honestly, while playing the game I was wondering aloud to my friend why the Prince is even needed in the adventure. Elika could've easily gone it alone.

Also as a result of it's non-linear nature the storyline in ""PoP"" suffers. While previous games in the series featured great stories and well balanced pacing, Prince of Persia does not. The game relies heavily on real-time interactions between the characters engaged by pressing the ""L2"" button. However, since most areas can be explored at any time you're never quite clear on why exactly you're exploring the area at all. Again the gameplay boils down to collect 45 Light Orbs to get X power to collect 160 more Light Orbs to fight X enemy. Rinse and repeat.

Sadly this is the first game in the series that I cannot recommend. The title has such well crafted graphics, and earnest effort to appeal to a broader range of people and a return to a less ""edgy"" art style than in Warrior Within and The Two Thrones. However, it's focus on mindless orb hunting and lack of difficulty completely unbalance the game and leave it a beautiful mess.",Beauty is Only Skin Deep,1236556800,,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

the other thing is the freaks. the occasional freaks of the last game were an interesting add on and i wouldv'e liked more of them. but this is way too much. at night the streets are flooded with freaks, wall to wall. it's not so bad really but the entire city? they couldv'e done it to a few slums or maybe just one of the 3 islands. and the freaks are removed by the very same means as the gangs, a few isolated bases where you defend a light bomb till it detonates and removes the freaks from the surrounding area. not the worst idea ever but with that being all there is it's like the game has become one big collectible sandbox. it feels like there is no game here, just a base that if you put a story into it might be fun to run.

the only other really big gripe i have is with the agent looks, they are all the same, you have 4 heads to choose from but once you level up once the heads are covered so the only difference between each agent online is color. i much much prefered the different heads that evolved as you leveled up, gave your agent some character and some uniqueness. overall i'd say this is a downgrade and really makes me pine for the days of crackdown 1.",improved gameplay but loss of everything else,1283212800,2,,

3.0,False,"03 23, 2006",A114TMHW9GRMPB,B000E0L424,DJ_King_SD,"Picked up the game yesterday at a local Gamestop. Here are some initial impressions after the first hour of play.

Gameplay (7/10)

This is probably the most important department, and SC disappoints. It was clear from the start that developers had trouble mapping all the controls for Fisher onto the PSP due to the absence of a second analog stick, as well as the two fewer shoulder buttons (L2/R2). Movement is severely hampered by this physical limitation. You cannot rotate the camera while moving, which severely limits your ability to get a feel for your surroundings. In order to rotate the camera, you must come to a complete stop, hold the ""O"" button, and pan using the analog stick. On the positive side, Fisher has all of the classic moves from jumping, rolling, split jump, SWAT move, and more. I haven't tried all the moves but most seem to be there. Knife attack is also included. Another positive is that you can save anywhere; no need to wait till you reach a checkpoint. For some reason, there are no maps for you to follow, which forces you to run around quite a bit especially in dark areas.

Graphics (6/10)

The graphics were also disappointing, seeing how Syphon Filter: Dark Mirror (SC:DM) was able to leverage the PSP so effectively. In the initial levels, the environment is really, really dark, so dark that it forces you to use the night vision goggles, which is fine except this view is extremely grainy (almost PS1 quality!) and does not enhance your vision much at all. Even at the highest brightness setting (PSP setting, not game; game does not provide brightness adjustment), it is STILL very dark. I cannot imagine playing this game in a bright room. I was in a relatively dark room, and had issues seeing most elements without using NV goggles.

There is noticeable tearing of the graphical elements such as walls; if Fisher moves too close to a wall, sometimes you can see right through it. In certain positions, you can even see through the back of Fisher's head and see his eyes! This was quite a surprise. I know a 6 out of 10 is harsh, but this is a Splinter Cell title; we have come to expect more than this!

Story (?)

Story in SC series has never been all that important or logical. This one is a bit different in that it takes place in the past when Fisher was a Navy Seal. I have not completed enough of the game to see the rest of the story line just yet.

Sound (8/10)

There was little music in the levels I have played so far; I expect it will improve. The sound volume seemed to be a bit low. The enemies whistle the same tunes that were heard in SC Chaos Theory or Pandora Tomorrow, which irritated me. I know this is a pseudo port to the PSP, but some new tunes would have been a nice change.

Replayability/Online (6/10)

As far as I am aware, there are no unlockables such as SC:DM offers, which limits replayability. There are 3 ""bonus missions"" in the main menu, but I have not tried these yet; these may require completion of standard missions first. Multiplayer is limited to ad-hoc only, and I do not expect to find much fun in this mode due to the quirkiness of the controls.

Final Score (7/10)

To sum up, this title failed to meet its potential. The SC series had set a high bar for the gaming industry, but this title failed miserably to meet its own standards. Do not get me wrong; there is much fun to be had here, despite the fact that the game feels rushed to market, is very much unpolished, and includes so many annoyances discussed previously. When compared to other action/shooter PSP titles in the market today, such as SOCOM and Syphon Filter, it simply does not compete. The absence of a playable demo also reinforced my original suspicion that this title was not quite ready for prime time.

Buy or Rent? First time fans should definitely opt for Syphon Filter: Dark Mirror instead. Long-time fans and/or SF:DM owners may consider renting first (if you can find it), or buying/selling after beating it/reaching end of patience with the bugs.

Update from March 27

3.0,False,"10 2, 2003",AQMWZIH22R6LE,B00005BRKQ,TwistaG,"THQ's Sega Arcade Gallery brings together four classic arcade games on a single Game Boy Advance cartridge. The collection includes Space Harrier, OutRun, Super Hang-On, and After Burner, all of which were originally released between 1985 and 1987. For the most part, the games come across well on the Game Boy Advance. All four employ traditional two-dimensional sprite-based graphics and use basric scaling and rotation effects to suggest the appearance of three-dimensional environments--a technique that's perfectly suited to the capabilities of Nintendo's popular handheld. While these games would seem dated on a more powerful console, they fit right in on the GBA.
Even today, OutRun is a truly enjoyable racing game. Space Harrier is the oldest game in the compilation, and it's also the most unique. Set in a world known as the fantasy zone, the game puts you in control of a warrior who soars through the air on a jetpack and battles monstrous creatures using a powerful blaster rifle. Thanks to the forward thrust produced by the jetpack, enemies and terrain are constantly racing toward you. It's your job to dodge these hazards and use your blaster rifle to defeat the bosses waiting at the end of each stage.
Space Harrier was just the second project for a 27-year-old producer and programmer named Yu Suzuki, who would later go on to design many recent hits such as Virtua Fighter 4, F355 Challenge, and Shenmue. Bits Studios did a nice job of bringing Suzuki's second undertaking to the GBA. The psychedelic color schemes and fast shooting action are just as addictive on the smaller screen. The only major deviation from the arcade game is the removal of the specific theme music for each of the bosses. Eagle-eyed fans of the original will also notice that the enemies don't aim as accurately in the GBA version, but the game is still plenty challenging. The next game in the collection is OutRun, which places you behind the wheel of a snazzy red sports car. Your goal is to beat the clock while traveling from one course segment to the next. Although there aren't any opponents to speak of, commuter traffic can slow you down or nudge you off the highway--where a collision with the various signs and boulders along the roadside will lead to a time-consuming rollover accident. A gearshift toggle lets you select between high and low gears, giving you better control through hairpin turns. The most distinctive feature of OutRun is that it allows you to choose between two different pathways at the end of each course segment. In this fashion, the scenery changes with each successive segment, giving you control over how the environment looks every time you play the game. In total, the game contains 15 unique courses. Except for a few minor differences, the version of OutRun included in this compilation is a tiny doppelganger of the original arcade game. The most noteworthy change involves the tendency of the car to pull more quickly toward the side of the road at higher speeds. This is a difference some purists may scoff at, but it literally takes less than 30 seconds to adjust to. Devoted fans often point to the game's music as its most outstanding aspect, and the GBA duplicates all three music selections with remarkable accuracy, even if the bass volume seems a little loud at times. Cosmetically speaking, there are fewer boulders and signs lining the side of the road, and the signs announcing the names of upcoming course segments are absent. All the other graphical features from the arcade game are present, however. Super Hang-On, the third game on the cartridge, has a lot in common with OutRun. The underlying goal of both games is the same: to reach the end of a lengthy course as quickly as possible. Here, though, all the vehicles are motorcycles as opposed to cars and trucks. There are a few other differences as well. The gearshift has been replaced with a nitrous boost that you can trigger at top speed, and you no longer have the option to pick and choose course segments during a race. Instead, you choose one of four different premade route maps before the race begins. In all, the game contains a grand total of 48 different course segments. Those of you who remember Super Hang-On for the Sega Genesis may be disappointed to learn that the GBA version doesn't allow you to collect parts or hire different mechanics. Those features were unique to the Sega Genesis version and not included in the original arcade game, which the GBA conversion is based on. Rounding out the collection is After Burner, an aircraft-based shooter in which you have to work your way through roughly 20 stages of oncoming fighter planes. Even though this pint-sized conversion of After Burner looks and sounds like the original arcade game, it doesn't play nearly as well. The controls are slow to respond, and you can avoid most--if not all--incoming fire by performing barrel rolls. The game is also just flat-out missing a few major aspects from the original arcade version, such as the ability to attack ground targets during bonus stages or the need to escape chase planes using the onscreen radar.
This version of After Burner is missing a few aspects from the original arcade game, such as the ability to hit ground targets in the bonus stages. The only other low point for the compilation is the absence of a save feature for recording high scores or pausing games in progress. This isn't a huge complaint by any means, but it's still annoying to make progress in a game or to input your name onto the high score list and have all your hard work disappear once you turn the system off. Despite the omissions and deficiencies in After Burner and the unfortunate absence of a save feature, Sega Arcade Gallery is one retro collection that's worth owning. The ports of Space Harrier, OutRun, and Super Hang-On are remarkably close to the original arcade versions, and all the games in the compilation compare well with what's already available for the Game Boy Advance.","Good,but not great",1065052800,5,,

From what I have discovered these are the pros and cons:

Pros
- nice graphics\animations and music.
- gameplay is very similar to the first two games which makes this a big plus.
- co-op and online play.
- item crafting.

Cons
- Lots of bugs on release day which mainly affects online play from what I have experienced.
- You must always be connected to the internet to play this game. Even single player. This is a form of DRM IMO.

If the two CONS do not bother you and know that bugs WILL be fixed then take the early dive and buy the game but only if your a fan of hack n slash and the first two games. It's very well done in that regard.

Once again, great sequel. 3 stars for the game -2 stars for bugs and DRM.

3.0,False,"06 9, 2009",A2E1QTFS01GT4P,B001L1AJ80,J. Urban,"""The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena"" was such an enjoyable game for me that it killed me that one significant flaw kept the game's fun level down. (I'll go into that below.) Aside from that, you get two games on one blu-ray disc. In fact, one of the opening screens upon booting up offers you a choice to play ""Escape From Butcher Bay"" or ""Assault on Dark Athena"", much like a movie DVD/Blu-ray menu, so the games are separate and are on the same disc. So you really get your money's worth, IF you haven't played ""Escape From Butcher Bay"" before, which I hadn't.

""Escape From Butcher Bay"" is an engrossing game that really (even being 5 years old) takes first person shooters into a different direction. You are able to interact with a whole cast of believable characters, many of which are better scripted and animated than ANY of the non-playable characters in ""Fallout 3."" The next-gen gloss really makes everything shine--no pun intended. The character models are very detailed and the backgrounds and levels are very sharp. Another reviewer complained about the graphics and I have to say I am shocked by that. There are very few times the graphics are anything less that next-gen. ""Assault On Dark Athena"" is built on the same engine and has equally sharp graphics and an interesting cast of highly detailed characters.

The stories for both are very much part of the Riddick universe and canon, with ""Escape From Butcher Bay"" being the one mentioned in the actual movies. I would say the story for ""Escape From Butcher Bay"" is superior to ""Assault on Dark Athena"", but not by much. Both are very detailed and your main quests (and side quests) add a lot of depth and time to the playing experience.

I thought the controls were very good and the selection of weapons was particularly generous--though I preferred the Ulaks, as they were quite lethal for silent kills or melee combat. The other weapons were nicely detailed and animated and it was always cool to walk into a room, shoot out the lights, and turn the Riddick eyeshine on so I could see in the dark.

The sound is great and many have mention the top notch voice acting. I have to agree, the voice acting was superb and it even has some musical cues from the movies.

The enemy AI is rather good and relentless. It really forces you to use Riddick's stealth abilities (which include the awesome eyeshine, where he can see in the dark) to perform quick kills.

Riddick, at times (in both games) can step into robot-like suits and then use them against the enemy. This is fun and adds variety. In ""Dark Athena"" he can even take over and control the zombie like soldiers, in certain areas.

Now to the issues that keep this from being a solid 4-5 star game. Well, the checkpoint save system is the worst I have seen in a long time. Many times you will be down to one health block and you move ahead and it automatically saves you progress there. You die and you start back there with one health block. If you die enough, the game generously gives you another one and I have heard if you die enough, then another one. But this save system saps the fun out of the game by constant loading screens and then you finding out you have a large amount of enemies or big enemies to fight, BUT you only have one to two health blocks. It is very tiresome and adds a lot of deaths and restarts. Also, the map system in ""Escape"" (which is actually non-existent in ""Dark Athena"") doesn't help at all as it doesn't show your location or direction on the map! These two flaws seriously affect an otherwise awesome gaming experience and that is sad.

There's some minor glitches I noticed like one of the cut scenes had dialogue spoken, but there was a serious delay to the characters lip-synching. Also, there was some slowdown and choppiness.

Overall, it is a fun game despite the flaws and glitches. I had a great time, though cursing at the screen from time to time, and I think most will enjoy the game if they can overlook these problems.

Pros:
*15+ hrs. of gameplay.
*Great graphics for the character models and levels.
*2 games for one price.
*Well constructed levels, with multiple non-linear routes.
*Controls are pretty solid.
*Enemy AI is good.
*Sound is good.

Cons:
*The worst checkpoint save system that results in many loading screens and many deaths due to reloading with few health blocks. (Should have had a nice hard drive install to speed up loading times or do away with them.)
*Enemy AI can get too good in some areas and also, while the game developers want you to be sneaking around, many enemies carry flashlights on their guns which makes sneaking almost a gimmick.

I like sound that has good deep bass and clear sound. The 500's did NOT do this for me... Seriously, I've learned a very important lesson when it comes to gaming headphones that NO one tells you about (Because the average gamer doesn't know).... Gaming headphones and virtual surround are made for gamers who 'NEED' to hear footsteps coming up from behind them.

Saying that, most gaming headsets in virtual sound will mute or dumb down bass or environmental sound so you can hear things like footsteps very, very clear. Here's what I learned on my third pair of headphones... IF you aren't a FPS gamer and play all sorts of games, get a amplified stereo headset and save yourself a $100 or so dollars. 7.1 / 5.1 and all those gaming presets are for FPS gamers. I say this because I ended up going back to my TB X12's which are $40, I've had them for 5 years and the bass and treble are really well balanced and the bass rumbles in my ears. I went back and forth testing the X12's compared to the Gold's and 500s and I couldn't deny the difference AND they are only $40.

SO, as of yesterday I returned my 500's to Amazon and I'm getting the PX24's. This advice I'm giving is coming from someone who plays a lot of different types of games, I don't need to specifically hear footsteps, I want good low rumbling bass and want to hear the heaviness of a gunshot or engine. Don't bother with the expensive surround headphones, they are all hyped. Most people review these and rave about them because they've never owned any other type of pair or compared them to several headphones. They don't know any better.

My wife was laughing while I was testing the 500's because I kept yelling, ""HOW DOES A $40 X12 Headset beat a $100 7.1 surround set??"" It was frustrating because I wanted the 500s to work but for now on I'm sticking to the cheaper ones and getting better sound. Side note, I just bought No Man's Sky and used that game and Just Cause 3 to test the sound on the headphones. The 500's drowned out the phasers and engines. I ended up skipping the surround sound altogether and sticking with the 'Bass & Tremble' setting... WHICH IS essentially the X12's and Px24's.  I also threw in GTAV and Metal Gear Solid V.  Same results.

Also, just to point out, the Gold Wireless lacked any bass whatsoever.  I was shocked but then discovered that the reason for no bass is the reason the 500's sucked...  It dulls / plays down a lot of atmospheric / environmental sounds including gun shots, etc...  This is to give the playing a major edge in FPS so they can hear footsteps, clips reloading, etc.  ONE more time, if you aren't a FPS fanatic and don't care if you hear footsteps coming up behind you, get cheaper amplified headphones.  Even with the X12's I could get somewhat surround but it keeps all the sounds at a full level and balanced.  Just frusturuing because most reviewers don't know this and take it for what it's worth.","I've owned the x12's, PS Gold's and the 500p's.  Ended up going back to the X12's.

Concept:  8/10
Take the Mechs, Giant Monsters, and Sci-Fi Battles from Lost Planet and create some very polished levels designed around player cooperation.  Throw in a VS Mode and a Training Mode, too.

Story:  8/10
This game takes place on a thawed out EDN III, which was completely encased in ice in the original game.  This isn't really a character driven story like the first game.  Instead, the story is used to set up the factions that exist in the world.  There are Carpetbaggers, Pirates, Nevec Soldiers, Scavengers, and of course Giant Monsters called Akrid.  The main storyline revolves around a giant creature that is draining the planet of Thermal Energy and could cause a second ice age.  All of the planets warring inhabitants must band together to kill a creature the size of a city.  The story is told through good mission design and wonderfully rendered cinematics.

Graphics:  9/10
The game looks great.  There are jungles, deserts, frozen tundras, space stations, mechs, battles, giant monsters...  Everything looks great and the character designs are excellent (Which is what you'd expect from Capcom.)

Gameplay:  Mixed
There are 4 basic gameplay Modes and some are better than others.

Single Player Campaign:  7/10
You can play through the story alone or with friends.  If you play alone, you can select 1-3 AI allies to help you.  But these guys aren't the sharpest tools in the shed.  They're more like a sack of hammers.  They just sort of run around and help a bit.  This is good because it allows the player to do the important stuff and feel like a hero.  But it's also bad because it doesn't feel like they're helping enough.  At least they don't hinder you.  Most of the levels are over the top outstanding, but a few of them are a bit confusing.  It's not exactly clear where you need to go and you might be a little bit frustrated at times.

Coop Campaign:  9/10
Man, this is fun if you have the right people.  It's the same levels, but you and your friends feel like an elite special forces group of badasses as you take down enemies together.  The game allows you to customize the look, animations, weapons, and special abilities of your characters.  It's not to the degree as something like World of Warcraft, but you really can set up your character to specialize in a certain type of situation.  (Battling vs Mechs, Monsters, Troops, aiding Allies, etc...)  I'm addicted to this mode right now.  And, if your party dies too many times, you can actually fail the level, so there's some pressure on the team to work together.

Training Mode:  5/10
Not sure why this is in the game, but you can run obstacle courses, try things out, or battle AI enemies in arenas.  It's pretty simple and you get XP for playing.

Vs Mode:  3/10
This is not good.  There are a bunch of levels with a bunch of different objectives like:  Elimination, Team Elimination, Data Post Capture, Akrid Egg Capture, etc...  Unfortunately, the grenades in the game are WAAAY overpowered, so the action pretty much devolves into people throwing grenades over walls.  In the larger maps, you really have to know where the good weapons are or you will get owned.  (Pwned)  Also, this mode really could have been much better if the players were allowed to customize their gear like in Call of Duty.  Instead you normally spawn with a generic gun and random grenades.  It's too bad because the game really doesn't allow you to adopt a playstyle (Sniper, Support, Heavy Gunner, etc...)

Levels:  7/10
Aside from a few confusing spots, the levels are great looking, imaginative, and require some teamwork.  They're very epic and over the top, too!!!  Battles on trains, battles on flying warships, battles underground, battles in space, battles in the jungle...  They're GREAT!  The mission objectives are:  Kill Giant Monster, Control certain parts of the map, Vital Suit Battles, advance through hostile territory and kill everything along the way...

Advancement:  5/10
Whenever you play any mode, you earn points.  These points are used to unlock things via a slot machine mechanic.  Push the button and get something.  (There is no fail.)  You earn either a nickname like, ""Machine Gun Maniac"", ""Techromancer"", ""Shy around girls"", ""Need to do homework"", ""Outlaw"", the scores of names basically allow you to give a bit of personality to your character.  You can also unlock one of a hundred different emotes which range from useful, to fun, to hilarious.  There are communication emotes, ""Follow Me"", ""Over Here"" to dances ""The Nerd"", ""Hip Thrust"", ""Lizard Dance"", etc...  There are taunts, happy emotes, cooperative emotes, and group emotes.  They're all very well done and pretty fun.  And finally, you can unlock weapons.  Machine Gun II, Machine Gun III, Gun Sword, Plasma Grenade II, etc...  The game doesn't ever tell you the difference between them though, which is disappointing.  I'd love to see stats.  Actually, I'd love to see a gun, then be able to add parts to it like a longer clip, a scope, a flash suppressor, etc...  similar to Call of Duty.  That would have really helped this game quite a bit.

Sound:  10+/10
The soundtrack is an epic score worthy of a Hollywood Summer Blockbuster and the combat SFX are GREAT!!!

Replay Value:  9/10
If you enjoy the Coop Mode, you can really get a lot of enjoyment out of the game.  There are 4 different difficulty levels, too.  Oh, and there are 22 Unique Missions.

Maturity:  Teen
There is some sci-fi violence, but nothing gory or over the top.  No sex.  And there are a few swear words for comic value.

Overall:  7/10
This is a pretty good single player game, a great co-op game, and a terrible Vs. game.  If you liked the combat of Lost Planet 1 and you have friends to play with, you can really have a lot of fun.  The game is pretty cheap now and definitely worth getting.

Buy it if you will have an Xbox Live Gold Account and will use the Coop Feature.
Rent it if you have about 10 hours to blow through the single player campaign.
Avoid it if you love VS Multiplayer.  This is pretty weak and doesn't really stand up to the other shooters.

If you enjoyed the Coop Feature here, you should have fun playing Gears of War 3 and Halo Reach.","Great Co-op, Lackluster Everything Else",1326412800,,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

I wonder if they included features here intentionally so as to justify an ""expansion pack"" or if they were really pushed up against a time frame and simply decided to wait until this release to include the Random Map Generator and the other (albeit minor) features.

I do appreciate the new artifacts and abilities because they enable me to make better customized maps (in my humble opinion).  The dwarves are pretty cool to play with and the campaigns are alright.

Overall this expansion is kind of typical of what you'd expect nowadays.  Basically, the game producers hold off with some nice features and release them separate from the base game.  Monetarily speaking, in this case, the base game will cost you about $30 and the expansion will be another $30.  For $60 you bought a pretty cool game, but I still think it is too expensive.  This, however, is the norm nowadays.

The Heroes V game is a great upgrade in the series, only I would price this first expansion pack around $15 to be fair.  But then again, everything costs what consumers are willing to pay for them.

To close, if you love Heroes V, this expansion won't be coming down in price any time soon, so you might as well decide HOW MUCH you love the base title.  I would think this pack would delight the diehards more than anybody else, especially those who enjoy the customization more than the installation-provided scenarios.  The Random Map Generator turned out to be a great product, and the added items, etc. make you want to be more creative and use more of the game's new tools.

EDIT:

Well, I feel like an old-timer - that initial review was written eight years ago!

Anyway, I will say now in 2014 that HOMM5 is the last good HOMM title - HOMM6 is not very good at all; a true disappointment.

Also, this review was written before I stumbled upon Tribes of the East (ToTE).  I was really upset when I did that, by the way, because ToTE is the ""complete edition"" of HOMM, yet Ubisoft (a shoddy French game company) doesn't want you to know that.  With ToTE, you get a completely expanded HOMM5 franchise in one stand-alone product: you get the base game, the Dwarves, and also the third optional tier of characters... all in one.  The base game and the Dwarves expansion are now useless.  Of course, the Dwarves expansion pack (Hammers of Fate) provides something like 3 custom maps with it.  My guess, as I have not checked (since I stupidly trusted Ubisoft not to screw me and I bought Hammers of Fate), is that you can find these few custom maps online for free.

So yeah, if you really want HOMM5 (because HOMM6 is terrible), then just get the ToTE version.  Also, double-check Steam and compare to Amazon's prices.  I noticed that ""The Heroes Pack"" on Steam is $20 (not a sales price) as of this date (which also includes a separate title: Dark Messiah, which is a first-person adventure game), though again you only need ToTE - which is $10 without a sale.  If you wait for these to go on sale, you could get ToTE for between $2.50 and $5.00, which is what I now recommend.

Lastly, in my humble opinion, HOMM3 and HOMM4 are the best titles in the franchise.  My advice is to avoid Ubisoft like the plague - European countries don't know how to treat people right; stick with the Americans: they don't outwardly bamboozle you (exception: Electronic Arts).","Not Bad, Not Great, Some Expected",1164326400,21,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

I'm sure other reviewers gave it some praise, but I'm rather picky and expected something more... refined and mindful. The demo for the game was more fun to me, and I felt mislead. I guess no review or demo truly shows how a game works in the long run.

3.0,False,"09 22, 2006",A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000G7X0B8,Tsanche,"Don't let the ""2"" at the end of this title fool you. It's basically an upgrade to the first Samurai Warriors. It features most (if not all) the same basic elements and hardly improves over the first one at all. Once again Koei has given us a basic hack and slash game. As if the slew of Dynasty Warriors games wasn't enough. Samurai Warriors isn't really all that different than any of Koei's other hack and slash games.

To begin, the game really does look the same as it did before. No real graphical enhancements, and not much of a polish to them either. So when I say this game is more or less the same, I'm not kidding.  The XBOX360 version actually looks like the PS2 version; there is no graphical enhancements for the 360 version, which is a shame.  Meaning if graphics is your thing, you might want the PS2 version instead as there's really no difference.

The only real difference between Dynasty Warriors and Samuraie Warriors (that stands out the most, anyway) is the simple fact that Samurai Warriors focuses on fuedal Japan (Dynasty Warriors focuses on China). There are an upwards of 26 characters to select from, most of which are locked until you complete the default characters storymode. In story mode you'll play through chapters just hacking and slashing away at your enemies. It's time Koei added more variety to these games. There aren't really a variety of ways you can deal with your enemies, and much like Dynasty Warriors, they clump up all over the screen. At first it's actually somewhat fun, but again, if you've played the first Samurai Warriors (along with Extreme Legends) and played the Dynasty Warriors games (along with those Extreme Legends) then you'll be disappointed (or really happy) to know that it's the same thing you've already been doing for years. Truly, this single aspect of the game could make or break it for you. Some aren't bothered by this at all. It's why Koei can continue to chuck out the same game over and over again. It's virtually the same, but some people like sameness, and of course I'm saying if you do then you'll feel right at home with this game, so don't let this review discourage you.

The story mode cutscenes are also given their own little dramatic effect. It doesn't work very well though. Like your standard Koei game, the English voice overs are terrible. They're so monotone and the dialogue is just bad. It's a good thing that you can easily have some fun with this game without gettind discouraged by the horrible voice acting. The music itself is really hit or miss. There's nothing really memorable about the music at all, and at times it just doesn't always feel right. We can let this slide, though.

Aside from story mode there is also a free mode which is more or less exactly like it sounds. You can choose any level you want and just go in and hack and slash at everything.

The game does try hard to put more of a strategic effort to the missions, but it's almost non-existant. For example, your attention may be called to an area on the map. The game expects that you'll take off and go there. You're not going to have to do that, though. There's really nothing strategic about Samurai Warriors. There wasn't anything strategic about the first one, and the second one's attempts to be such are pitiful.

There are two aspects of the gameplay that do stand out, though. One is the skill system, where you spend gold to learn skills for your character. It helps to make characters seem a little less generic, but not entirely. It does, however, give the game some much needed flavor and some neat customization ability. So there actually is a point to using characters over and over again, and chaning things up. The second aspect may very well be my favorite. The mini game: Sugoroku. It's more or less Monopoly with Samurai Warrior characters, and it's actually really fun to play, and can be quite addictive when playing with friends.

There's online play in this game (though the PS2 version doesn't go online), but it's not really satisfying.  It's terrible as a matter of fact.  When you go online you're put on two different maps.  Yes, I said different.  You'll never actually see your opponent.  The basic goal is to defeat the enemy commander on your map before your opponent defeats the commander on theirs.  Even worse, this is the only thing you can really do online.  There's no flavor to it.  You never see your oppoent, and there's no competetive or co-op modes or anything online.  It's really sad to see.  So while the game does have an online mode, you might as well forget about it and play freeplay or storymode because it's essentiall the same thing.

Overall, if you liked the first one, I'm not saying you'll dislike this one. I'm saying it's not really all that different. It's more or less an expansion of what's already been done a million times, and not just in Samurai Warriors. The gameplay can be fun, but just hacking and slashing at your enemies forever and ever with little variety will probably get pretty boring after a while.",Samurai Warriors 2.0,1158883200,9,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

Shame on the producers of this game for building up wave after wave of zombies and giving you the clunkiest most useless play control functions for a game this good looking. And shame on me for throwing down good money to own a copy of the Collector's Edition with extra junk I'll never get any use out of.

You want to play the game I say go for it --here's what I learned. A tip from me to YOU .. change your control scheme to CONTROL TYPE D

Seriously .. the default controls will make you want to hate this game and if you're coming in hot off the awesome that is Resident Evil 4 --Type D is YOUR CONTROL SETTING!

The only difference is the X button Fires your weapon instead of A; you have to press and hold A to Run.

With Type D you get that sweet-sweet snap function (with the right-stick on the controller) when you aim on nearest target is in there - so it helps in a lot of scenes in the game where waves of dudes just fill a room looking to share with you the good word about Umbrella.

After discovering that through the help of my friends I restarted the game and never really had a problem with the game since.

Control Type D is money.

Why did I give this game 3 stars?

Easy .. play mechanics - I shouldn't have to dedicate my review to explaining how awesome Control Type D is when I could be talking about the great story line, the amazing location settings of Africa or one of the best multiplayer experiences since RE:4 just got BETTER!

Batman: Arkham City for the PS3 receievs high marks in all three of these, and yet is held back from true greatness by the lack of good storytelling and boss fights that have no place in the game to begin with.

I won't spoil how the story goes down, but suffice to say Batman must race against time over the course of one night in Gotham to avert a great catastrophe engineered by the Joker. The biggest problem is, the story is a disjointed mess. It relies on a few implausible events that cannot allow me to suspend disbelief. Compounding this is the fact that the main conflict reaches a few points of possible resolution well before the end. Not a bad thing by itself, except for the clear opportunities to introduce plot twists are ignored and focus solely on the main problem facing Batman.

It got so blatant that late in the game I went to see a temporary ally who was helping me to get something I needed. I said out loud, ""he'll screw me over."" And what do you suppose happened? Without any provocation or rationale, he very predictably turned on me, leaving the necessary item in a ""secure"" place while attacking me. Having taken care of him, I turned around to find the item was of course gone. About two hours of playtime for absolutely no reason.

The story strings you along like this for the length of the campaign. Very few plot twists, and more egregiously, very few of the in-game cinematic ""moments"" (as I call them) that made Arkham Asylum such a trip - we all remember the Morgue, Scarecrow's reboot, etc. Granted there are a handful of these mind tricks, but not enough to suit me.

Story would not normally be such a big deal, except for the fact that 1) this is Batman, and 2) the first game set a high bar for storytelling. This game's story would be an annoyance in other franchises; it's a pure disappointment with this one.

The other issue is the boss fights, which make the almost total lack thereof from the first game look good by comparison. Yet another slew of boss fights following a predictable script:

1. Dodge invulnerable boss's two attacks.
2. Wait until boss makes himself vulnerable with super attack, or environmental weapon becomes obvious.
3. Trigger explosion/electrocution/confetti, leaving boss stunned and/or vulnerable.
4. Get in two combination strings before boss gets back up, once agian invulnerable. Fight lackies that come to boss's aid while he takes a breather.
5. Repeat 1-4 two more times. (Why does it always have to be three times?)
6. Quicktime event finish. Cue cutscene.

I would really love to have a boss fight with some emotional impact in this game, without being so predicatble. GOW3's finale is a great example of this, as was the final demo monster from Dead Space 2.

The main issues I had about this game was that the weapons were stupid accurate.  You could be walking and raise a sniper rifle and blast people from a very long distance with ease.  You didn't have to stop and crouch or anything of the sort.  Also I thought that sniper was kinda worthless in the sense that you had a person with an SMG about 200 yards away in the open and you were a sniper.  You zoom in to shoot about by that time you are already dead becasue the SMG is just as accurate as the sniper rifle from that distance.  This was the main thing I did not like about it.  Also I didn't know what all the weapons did being futuristic and all.  But I know if I played the game more I would find that all out be do to the accuracy issues I could not play the game long enough to learn everything.

When I found out that Infinite World was coming out on the PS2, I was kind of skeptical at first of looking into it but decided to get it because of its' low price. After playing it, all I can say is it is a somewhat fun diversion for a little while but I wouldn't call it the best in the Budokai series.

Why? Well, the fighting has been watered down greatly compared to previous games. Gone are the beam battles and over the top power moves. The arenas that you fight in aren't anything new, mostly arenas you've seen before in past Budokai games. You can still modify your character by editing his or her skills as well as tranform and whatnot. Dragon Mission serves as the game's story mode but leaves quite a bit to be desired, I'm afraid. The minigames and missions just aren't that fun to me. There are two other modes: Dragon Duel is a versus mode where you can challenge a second player or the computer, and the unlockable Fighter's Road has you fighting with more than 100 combatants to unlock and take down across four maps. Still, it doesn't make up for the fact that this game is mildly entertaining.

For this to be DBZ's last hurrah on the Playstation 2, it's a shame that it didn't go out with alot more glory. As much as I want to recommend this game to any DBZ fan, all I can advise is to rent it first and then decide. You might feel differently than I do about its' content.

3.0,False,"12 14, 2005",AVQID963FEXF4,B00006F2ZS,#Infinity,"I am a huge fan of DDR.  Finally, a fun video game that actually burns up some calories!  You'll need to pay some extra money to get a dance pad in order to truly expose the game's potential, but it's definitely worth it.  The concept of it is extremely simple, as you just hit the arrows scrolling up the screen when they're in their outlined counterparts, but once you start doing this to the beat of the lively music, you'll be moving your body in enjoyment and exercise alike.

DDR Max is the United States' 3rd (4th if you count the Disney Mix) home installment of Konami's successful Dance Dance Revolution franchise that ignited in 1998.  While earlier versions of DDR in the US managed to possess the arcade counterparts' interface and main list of songs, their dated status (PS1 games released in 2001 and 2002!) hindered their sales and attractiveness.  Late 2002 saw the release of DDR Max US, and while it's still better than the PS1 installments, it just really doesn't use its full potential very well.

What I do like about DDR Max Dance Dance Revolution is that it brings superb updates to the graphics, which helps it keep up with modern technology.  It is the first Dance Dance Revolution for the PS2, and thus delivers a sharper and smoother image.  It's also much easier to select a song to dance to, as it overstates the song details on the ""Select Music Screen"".

DDR Max also brings in an innovation to the challenge of DDR with freeze arrows, which are steps that force you to hold your foot on an arrow until the freeze arrow disappears.  Freeze arrows can force you to spin around your pad, otherwise resulting in an N.G., where you don't hold a freeze arrow for the required amount of time.

I also adore the addition of the ""groove radar"", which helps players track down not just how hard a song is, but how it's hard in different ways:  Stream (the amount of steps), Voltage (the highest precipitation of steps in a small amount of time), Chaos (the amount of syncopated steps), Air (the amount of double-steps), and Freeze (the overall amount and length of freeze arrows).

The many different modes that can be played with make things significantly fun.  The Lesson Mode can teach new players how to pay the game, and after that, they can start practicing in the Training Mode before they're ready to handle a regular game.  You can also keep track of your fitness using the Workout Mode, which shows you how many calories you've been burning lately.  The Edit Mode allows you to customize your own steps to songs for when, for example, you want a bigger challenge on a particular song.  New to DDR Max is the Nonstop Challenge/Oni Mode, a competitive challenge that forces you to play several songs in a row.  If you miss one step, you lose a life, and you only have four lives at the start (although you gain one life for clearing one song)!

With more memory space thanks to the PS2, consumers will get to choose from a much larger song list than they could on the PS1 versions.  Instead of about 30 or 50 songs (the amount that the older DDR's had), you can choose from over seventy songs of dancing music...

But that leads to the bad news.  With so many songs available, Konami of America probably thought that they could get away with leaving us all of the worst songs that they've created.  In other words, the songs on DDR Max are extremely monotonous, and they aren't even very fun to dance to.  The Japanese have their own edition of DDR Max (called DDR Max:  Dance Dance Revolution 6th Mix), and while there are extremely few tunes that can be selected, the ones that can are fun, catchy, and have awesome steps.  Almost all of those songs, such as ""WWW.Blonde Girl"", ""Witch Doctor"", and ""Let's Groove"", are completely absent for the United States, and instead, we get a bunch of boring, lame, and un-danceable R&B-ish stuff like ""Deep in You"", ""Peace-Out"", and ""Let's Talk it Over"".  I know that there are clearly some people who will enjoy these songs, but come on, this is supposed to be a DANCING GAME, not a sleep-walking game.  Most of the songs don't even use freeze arrows, since they're mainly Konami Originals from Japanese PS1 versions, which didn't feature freeze arrows.  On the upside, hardcore DDR fans will spend hours playing old classics like ""Rhythm and Police"", ""PARANOiA Evolution"", and ""Max 300"", while newer players will have a blast playing the DDR Max US-exclusive songs ""I Like to Move it"" and ""Sandstorm"".  Those are all splendid songs, but with very few good tunes with a selection of over seventy, the enjoyment out of the music is comparable to that of the old editions.  Needless to say, there's hardly anything for anyone.

While new innovations make DDR Max a sensible choice for the DDR crowd in the United States, it just isn't enough, and not enough thought was put into it.  The song list is the main source of power for a Dance Dance Revolution game, and without a good selection of dance tunes, newbies will never get hooked on such a great game.  Instead, I recommend purchasing either DDR Max 2 US or DDR Extreme 2 US.  Both games possess the graphical brilliance of DDR Max, but also feature a much more diverse and enjoyable selection of songs.  They also include Beginner's Mode, and without it, new dancers would possibly never be able to get better at such a challenging game.  Your best bet is to just leave this game on the shelves until you really need it.","Good Graphics, Terrible Song Selection",1134518400,10,,

I basically missed the last generation of gaming since I did not get a Xbox 360 until Feb 2013. Since then, I have been playing a backlog of AAA games. I've found that after playing games developed later in the console cycle, I don't have the ""stomach"" for earlier games. They just are not as refined. With that being said...

Assassin's Creed was awesome.  ...for about the first three or four memory blocks (levels). After that, the repetition of the game began to get to me. You basically do the same things over, and over, and over, and over, and... you get the idea.

Next is the gameplay mechanics themselves. OMFG. This started to literally, piss me off. For example, I am trying to escape a horde (yes a horde) of guards that I pissed off because some weirdo pushed me by climbing a ladder. Except I can't get on the ladder because I run up the wall, then fall. Or climb a box, barrel, vendor stand, and so on. What I am saying is, a lot of the frustration was from poor game mechanics, not intentionally hard gaming.

Now the good...

I agree with reviewers that say it is visually stunning, because it is. Even for a game that was fairly early into this generation, it looks sweet. By comparison, I find the graphics styling in the first game to be slightly more impressive than the second, but I've only played the second for about 30 minutes.

Also, it is kind of sweet assassinating people, jumping from rooftops, and even the fighting is pretty good (once you get the hang of it).

By the end of the game I was wishing for just that, the end. I was tired of battling waves of guards, running from a city full of guards, pickpocketing thieves and scums, saving citizens, and eavesdropping on bystanders. I am hoping, like most first entries into a series that the sequel builds on the good and burns the bad.","Better Late than Never, Right?",1393632000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Pros:
+ Great, great story (I think this is why it gets unbelievable reviews)
+ Unique powers like telekinesis and such, and using them is cool.

Cons:
+ Graphics are too cartoony to be creepy or engaging.
+ The game's too dark (even with brightness up) to see a lot of the splicers until it's too late.
+ Too repetitive.  Again, the special powers are cool, but you use them all the time.
+ Kills seem to be random.  I'll hit one splicer in the head with a revolver once, and she'll die, then the next one will take 8 head shots.
+ On a similar note, aiming is too sensitive, so you waste a ton of bullets.
+ No block.  If I'm gonna beat someone with my wrench, I want to be able to block their attack too.  Melee's not fun without blocking.

3.0,False,"02 20, 2007",A2DGSWAKU0VB4P,B000GIPJ8E,Michael Clarkson,"Top Line: Origins is a solid game, but suffers from a number of poor design decisions that ultimately detract from the experience. Fans of the original may find changes to the combat system disheartening; newcomers may find the game to be simply inscrutable. All players are likely to find some of the design decisions frustrating.

Gameplay: Good

The original Baten Kaitos operated on an unusual combat system that made use of ""Magnus Cards"" that were drawn from an individual character's 'battle deck' and 'played' to achieve combat actions. In Origins, this formula is altered in three main ways. Firstly, the combat cards are no longer weapons, spells, or pieces of armor but attacks. Secondly, the battle system has shifted from turn-based to round-based. Thirdly, all the characters share a single combat deck. While some of these changes might have been good ideas, the execution was off, and as a result the combat is significantly less fun than in the original.

The first aspect of change was the shift to attacks. While weapon and armor cards are still around, they are now played to change a character's static equipment and modulate attack or defense. A character can only use one piece of equipment at a time, meaning one cannot simultaneously wear a weapon and a piece of armor. Attack cards basically come in two flavors, and the multiplicity of magnus numbers from the first game has been reduced to just one. Based on its strength, an attack card will have a number 1-7; these must be played in ascending order. Attack cards with numbers higher than 3 will also cost MP, which are earned by playing sequences of magnus cards or using equipment. In a way, this makes more sense than the old system, but it suffers from the fact that the number of available attacks is quite limited, and that only Milly has any custom attacks in the lower numbers. Having a broader range of introductory attacks, and keeping the old magnus number system, would have made combat much more enjoyable.

The combat system is essentially round-based. While there is a pseudo real-time aspect to the delay between turns that means occasionally you will be choosing attacks for only one character, most of the time all your characters will all be playing their magnus cards simultaneously. This is an essential feature of the game because it allows characters to chain attacks. When a character ends a turn with a special attack, the next character can, under certain conditions, continue a string of attacks uninterrupted for bonus damage. While this is occasionally useful, enemies do not die until a chain is completed, meaning that if an initial string of attacks is successful, the combo ends up wasting a character's turn. Moreover, the round-based system comes with its own set of disadvantages. There are, for instance, some boss battles where being unable to stop attacking, or to change the target mid-round, are serious problems. More significantly, the round-based system causes the player to be disengaged from the combat round. Combat amounts to a frenzy of card assignment followed by a long (with some enemies who have lengthy attack animations, VERY long) wait. As the game progresses, this tends to make combat a little boring and/or frustrating, in stark contrast to the original's combat system, which kept the player engaged not only during his selection of his own attacks, but also during the enemy's.

The final difference is that only one deck is used for the whole party. This was a terrible idea. While it does introduce some interesting dilemmas of strategic deck design, the restrictive number of cards allowed per deck significantly limits the possibilities that are actually reasonable. In particular, cards that affect status ailments other than death are essentially useless; they take up too much deck space to be worthwhile. Even a few battles will convince you that it's easier to wait status effects out using healing items than to waste deck space with items that cure poison or sleep. While the new discard feature is welcome, it quickly becomes clear that it's absolutely necessary in order for this system to work at all. While the basic attack cards are not character-specific, high-level attacks and essentially all equipment cards are (and only one of these can be played per turn). As a result, the appearance of a full hand of cards that are of no use, or can only be used by a single character, is depressingly frequent.

'Camp magnus' from the first game have been excised entirely; characters always start combat with a full health gauge, and all status effects end immediately after a battle. Quest Magnus return, along with useful ""magnus mixers"" that can be used similarly to the magnus combos of the previous game. Those combos, however, are gone, as also is the wondrous variety that went with them. The numerous food magnus and their kin are essentially gone, replaced by nondescript potions and bandages.

The game manages to be well-balanced in stretches, but there is a tremendous step up in difficulty at the beginning of the second disk, starting with an enormously long and difficult boss fight and only getting worse from there for a dungeon or two. While the game eventually settles into a steady progression again, the experience yields never truly catch up with the difficulty of the battles or the need for leveling. Even if the yields were better, leveling up doesn't do all that much good; characters simply do not gain enough strength per level to make their progress seem rewarding.

Dungeon designs are passable, but never truly interesting, and do not possess any puzzles of notable difficulty. It's very easy to just bull through most areas, though you will spend a lot of time in combat.

Additionally, the game has an absolutely insulting number of unwinnable battles. I accept the need for the main character in an RPG to sometimes be defeated. This does not imply that it is necessary to force me to fight that battle that I will automatically lose, or that it makes any sense at all to hand me a ""Game Over"" for dying too soon in said battle.

Overall, the gameplay mechanics are solid, but some bad decisions were made that significantly detracted from my enjoyment of the game.

Story: Good

The story here is actually two stories: one about a boy named Sagi a few decades before the events of the original Baten Kaitos, and another about a family trying to save the world during the Time of the Gods. The tale of Malpercio, presented in several different versions in the original game, mutates yet again. There is some interesting stuff here and there plot-wise, but it never really hangs together. There's a lot of mishmosh about people's hearts being too strong or not strong enough, and a pair of maniacal villains bent on destroying the world and burning down trees and stuff, but in the end it amounts to being just a generic mess, with stock Luddite ramblings about the evils of technology. Some of the twists along the way are interesting, but others are downright stupid (especially the final act of betrayal), and despite the name, the origins of the world Kalas and Xelha enter in the original are not really made any clearer.

The character interaction between Sagi, Milly, Guillo, and the player (again the player is himself a character in the world as a spirit) is pretty good, and there are many nice character moments, which bring my opinion up, but the characters don't do much evolving. Sagi is pretty much the same person at the end of the game as he was at the beginning, a story weakness made even more glaring by comparison with the tremendous evolution Kalas and Xelha undergo in the original. Most of the truly interesting character angles and ideas never really get much play, although there could have been more solid ruminations on what constitutes good and evil and about the nature of betrayal. Almost all of the NPCs are two-dimensional and not really worth the trouble. For a video game, this is all right, but nothing to write home about.

Audio: Good

The music in Origins is not as grand as in the original, but still quite passable. Many of the pieces are rearrangements or variations on the existing BK soundtrack, which is perfectly appropriate and works out quite well in a few of the battles. The voice acting, thank god, is solid, a huge improvement over the original. However, I found many of the sound effects accompanying combat actions to be unpleasant.

Visuals: Good

This score would be higher, were more of the areas original artwork. A simply depressing quantity of the world, however, is composed of recycled screens from the original Baten Kaitos. The new areas are equally pretty, for the most part, but nothing is so stunning that you will be longing to see the artwork again. Additionally, the perspective is sometimes confusing, making it difficult to figure out how to move around some screens. The opening and final cinematics are presented in a watercolor cutout style that is interesting, but not particularly appealing. All other cutscenes are rendered using the game engine, which is reasonably good at conveying action, but lacks facial detail. All dialogue in the game appears onscreen with a headshot; these are likely meant to compensate for the player's inability to really see a character's face. Sometimes this works, sometimes it's not enough. The art on the magnus cards is nice, but again much is recycled. Overall, the artwork is of high quality, but enough of it is recycled for me to withhold some points.

Replayability: Average

There is a new game+ mode, and as before there are a lot of sidequests you could explore. However, I didn't really feel an urge to do so. Origins isn't actually that long, but it feels like a real slog towards the end, and you'll likely want to leave it on the shelf for several months before having a go at it again.

Overall: Enjoyable (77%)

I've probably come off a bit harsh here, but Origins isn't really a bad game, and if you're willing to put up with some of the frustrating design decisions it's actually quite a good one. However, caveat emptor! Fans of the original are likely to find the new combat system underwhelming, and the round-based combat can be a drag for anyone. The story is something of a mess, and hard to buy even on its own terms, although there are some interesting aspects that could have been drawn out more. Audio and visuals are enjoyable, and many will be familiar to those who played the first game (perhaps too familiar).

4.0,False,"04 18, 2008",A3ALLLC2FXZ134,B000VB800A,Halicon5,"I purchased this game for my girlfriend (along with Tomb Raider Legend for the Game Cube) because she really likes the Tomb Raider games, but I did not expect to play the game much at all.  I have never been a huge Tomb Raider fan.  On the original game I never progressed farther than half of the first level and watched my friends beat the rest of the game.  I wanted to play more of the original game, but the controls really annoyed me.  I didn't expect much from this version of the game either.

I'm glad that I was wrong.  This game is very good.  Not perfect, but very good.  I found myself pressuring my girlfriend to play more of the game so that I could have a crack at it.  The big problem is that I get into trouble if I start playing one of her games and I get farther into the game than she does, so I have to wait until she's done.

Graphically, the game is pretty good.  The levels are large, expansive, and look good.  Not amazing, but good.  Levels are designed to be aethetically pleasing and complex at the same time.  One of my favorite parts of the game is the waterfall zone in Peru.  There are moving cogs, gears, water wheels, and other objects on screen creating a vibrant and active environment, much of it interactive.  When I saw my girlfriend hit this part of the game, I had to give it a go.

I would favorably compare the game to the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time series. Lara moves with more freedom than she has in any other game except perhaps Tomb Raider legend.  She controls fluidly and feels acrobatic, but the Prince would own her any day with his mad Persian ninja skills.  The motion controls work well, especially the grappling hook.  There are some quick-time motion control events that work well, but feel slightly out of place mostly due to the glaring animation superimposed on top of the screen instructing you what to do.  Reducing the size of the instructional animation would have been a better design decision, but it doesn't hurt the overall fun factor.

Combat will probably upset some Tomb Raider purists while gamers who enjoy action games will probably view the changes to gunplay as an improvement.  Although Lara can lock the camera onto enemies, the player must actually aim the cursor using the wiimote pointer at the actual target.  Personally, I view it as an improvement and I like that combat requires more than just locking onto the enemy, running in circles around it while mashing down the fire button down.  My girlfriend didn't like it as much and it took her some getting used to because it was a major departure from the way combat has been handled in previous Tomb Raider games.  It doesn't actually make the game any better or worse, but it is a difference to take into account.  Ultimately, the game is truly about exploration and puzzle solving so a change in the combat system doesn't really affect my overall opinion of the game, as long as it works.  My only serious complaint about the game is the camera.  Usually the camera isn't a problem, but in combat it is easy to get disoriented in tight quarters if you aren't careful.  I didn't have much of a problem adapting to the camera, but my girlfriend did.  I chalk the difference up to the fact that I probably play way too many video games and have learned to adapt quickly to different camera systems while my girlfriend generally tries to do more productive things with her time and has less practice with those types of issues.  Ultimately, she got going along pretty smoothly and can raid tombs with the best of them.

Tomb Raider pros:
===> Clean, crisp graphics and beautiful environments.
===> Levels that are based off on the original Tomb Raider.  The levels have been changed signifigantly but still will hold a lot of nostalgia for gamers that played the original.
===> Generally well designed motion controls that add to the immersive nature of the game.
===> Low price tag: At $40, this game is definitely worth it.

Tomb Raider cons:
===> The camera gets a little too twitchy when in close quarters combat.
===> Player profiles automatically default to the first file, so if you have a second person playing through on their own profile, the game will automatically default to the first person's profile upon start-up, requiring any other player to load up their profile instead.  This is a really minor complaint, but it isn't an intuitive design unless you happen to be the only person playing the game.  I'm just picky about that.

Overall, I highly recommend this title to most gamers.  If you are looking for an action-packed blast fest with guns a-blazin', I recommend avoiding Tomb Raider games in general, but if you want a well-designed cerebral adventure with a great sense of exploration and wonder, this game is for you.  I enjoy this game so much that  I really want to see Tomb Raider 2 and 3 given the same treatment.

First the bad things, yes the camera isn't the best but it's far from bad as well, it's good. Secondly the platforming scenes can be a touch difficult but are still fun to get through, and third and my only real gripe is that the loading screen is pretty long after you die. I also don't like the main menu screen but that's just poor aesthetics, nothing to do with gameplay or the like. The game could have used a touch more polish, but is a good solid release overall.

The game does take some strategy with the fights even though it's very repetitive and you pretty much just kill everything in sight. The visuals are nice, the voices and storyline are solid and interesting, and so far the game seems to last around 7 hrs, not counting the three original sega genesis titles you are able to unlock, or the survival mode.

The story is pretty much you and your girlfriend go to a mansion, the Evil Dr. West kidnaps her and tries to kill you. You obtain a mask which seems to be very evil but also makes you a force to be reckoned with. But also saves your life. I'm not finished with the game yet so I can't give you too much of the storyline, but that'the gist from the word jump.

The killing is fun, the graphics and blood are great, the cut scenes are nice, and the quick time events to defeat bosses and break through walls etc.. are cool in my book. If you want a thinking mans game this is not for you, if you don't mind repetition, violence, cursing, and a little nudity then you may have as much fun with this as I am.

Gameplay:
Dead Space is a sci-fi survival horror game set in the distant future. After a friendly mining ship losing communications with headquarters, you and your crew are sent in to investigate the problem. Upon arrival, your ship loses control and collides into the friendly mining ship which causes serious structural damage and eliminates your means of escape. Shortly after, you find out that the ship is infested with a wide variety of disgusting creatures who all seek to kill you. Throughout the game, the story develops into a complicated series of strange relationships between yourself and those who you arrived with as the gameplay gets increasingly intense and new and more difficult monsters begin to appear.

The game sports an upgrade system which is done with items called nodes. Nodes can both be found through the game, as well as purchased for an expensive fee at the in-game store. These are then used to upgrade both your weapons and armor in a grid-like interface. To top that off, the 7 weapons in the game are all a blast to use and really help make the game fun in the long-run. However, the game does have some issues with close-range combat which can make some portions of the game annoyingly difficult. Another feature in the game is the stasis system. Early in the game, the main character learns how to use both stasis and telekinesis abilities. The stasis ability freezes enemies in front of the character, and telekinesis allows you to throw around objects. The stasis ability require stasis energy which is sometimes hard to come by, but its use is required in solving puzzles throughout the game, and both stasis and telekinesis are incredibly rewarding to use in combat if used effectively.

Controls:
The controls of the game have a sense of weight to them. Movement and turning is a little slow, but truthfully it fits the experience and isn't as much of an obstacle as it seems at first. One issue with the game is the close-range combat, which seems to be the one real weakness of the main character. If an enemy gets right in your face, it's really difficult to fire at the monster, and the melee attacks are practically useless. In some of the really difficult portions of the game, it creates somewhat of a problem, but the use of stasis to slow down the creatures is a great way to counter the issue. Overall, the controls are very precise and despite the shortcomings of the close-quarter combat, the game does a great job.

Graphics:
Graphically, Dead Space has a lot of strengths and a couple weaknesses. The lighting and shadows in the game are really spectacular and at times help make the game one of the scariest gaming experiences to date. Although the game features the same metal ship look throughout the game, the fine detail of the areas really helps give the environment life which therefore draws you into the experience. Another thing to note is that there are a few points in the game where you must exit the ship and enter zero gravity space. These sequences are really intense and feature some stunningly beautiful visuals. On the other hand, the textures throughout the game are rather low resolution, and even the character models aren't too friendly-looking either. All in all, the variety and environmental detail helps balance with the medium-quality textures to create a really terrifying experience that doesn't sacrifice frame rate.

Sound:
One of the most important things about any horror game is the sound. Visceral Games has hit the nail on the head with this game, and has delivered a terrific sound experience. The ambience and environmental effects are remarkable and really help make every portion of the game scary and immersive. The sound effects are really great and shooting in the vacuum of space has never felt so good. The voice acting is nothing to brag about, but it is definitely passable and has its great moments. In the end, the mixture of environmental effects and terrific sound effects from both the weapons and enemies create an incredibly eerie experience that will make you jump from your seat.

Replay Value:
Dead Space is a single-player only game that lasts roughly 14-17 hours. Some portions of the game are rather repetitive but a good portion of the game is scary and a lot of fun. The sheer amount of upgrades for your character are too much for 1 or maybe even 2 play throughs, so many will come back for more. The story is also hard to fully understand on the first play through, so a second play through is definitely warranted for many. Overall, the game doesn't last too long, but the terrifying experience is definitely worth the purchase.

4.0,False,"07 18, 2008",A3W4NLU1LAA153,B000TG72TM,Chris L,"COD4 - the latest and arguably best installment of the Call Of Duty series, is a proper game of two halves.

Controls
COD4 is a first-person run-and-gun game. You can sneak (and on some maps you have to) but for the most part it's shoot or be shot at. The controls are pretty good for this. Left stick moves you, right stick adjusts where you're looking. Various buttons crouch, jump, reload and fire. It's fairly intuitive to pick up and if you've played something like Drake's Fortune, the controls are sufficiently similar that it becomes a zero-learning-curve game. (Note - Drake's Fortune uses third-person camera - yuk. COD4 is first-person - ie. you look through your own eyes).

Graphics
The graphics in COD4 are good. Very good. Not brilliant, but a massive step up from the previous titles. The environments are detailed but the maps are relatively small. There is good texture mapping and use of colour and the global shadowing system is adequate. There are some problems though. There is a lot of aliasing on thin lines - power lines, cables - stuff like that. Aliasing is the stair-step effect (jaggies) that you get when a graphics system is unable to smooth out the differences in extreme contrast. For a console as power as a PS3, this shouldn't be a problem but it is. COD4 also suffers a lot of popup - where items pop in to view very late or change level of detail very late. This is particularly noticable on the Ambush map in multiplayer mode. The bricks and debris on the ground pops in in front of you almost in a wave as you run. Sandbags pop to their highest right in front of you and the burned out tanks in the middle of the map pop into high detail as you approach them. To start with you won't notice it, but once it catches your eye, you'll see it everywhere. Again - a PS3 shouldn't have this problem but COD4 is a multi-platform game so maybe they just coded to the lowest common denominator and didn't bother to tweak it for the PS3.
Smoke and particle effects are nice, but very processor-intensive. If someone pops a smoke grenade and you run through the smoke cloud, be prepared for very low framerates - it really bogs down. You'll see the same three or four textures used on smoke billowing through the smoke effects too so if you're waiting it out for the smoke to clear, you'll think ""hey - deja vu - I just saw that exact same smoke.""
There are specular highlights and bump maps used where you'd expect them to be used to pretty good effect. One of the neatest effects is the visual distortion you get around the muzzle of a gun during gunfire, or around an exploding grenade. Nice touch.
Occasionally you'll find faults in the graphics engine that make you wonder if the game didn't QA properly. On the Pipeline map for example, you can hop on to one of the oil tank rail cars and see through the oil tank. Sometimes when you die you'll fall out of the map or be able to see the inside of your character's head. The game runs at 60Hz for the most part, and in 720p it looks pretty good (but it's not full HD). There are places where it'll bring the PS3 to its knees though with the number of characters and effects all being drawn at once. Multiplayer mode on the Shipment and WetWork maps are good examples. You'll be lucky to ever see 60 frames per second on those maps.
Motion capture is good but not brilliant. All the requisite moves are there for all the characters but there are some noticable pops and bangs in between their set pieces. If you're in the thick of the action, you don't notice it so much but if you're spectating a multiplayer game, or observing enemies through a scope in the single player game, you'll often see a glitch in the motion capture between crouching and standing up. There's a definite pop as the characters go from slow, hunched-down crawl to normal walking when standing up. There are other issues here and there but the crouch-to-stand-up problem is the one that immediately springs to mind.

Sound
The audio on COD4 is also pretty good. There's good stereo separation at the front and excellent use of the rear channels. Often you'll be able to hear someone behind you giving you more reaction time to do something about it. It's so seamless in COD4 that I've come to rely on it. The weapons effects are OK and they use the subwoofer to good effect. There's noticable differences in weapons types, with and without silencers, but I suppose only a gun nut would be able to tell you if they're right. There's a couple of mis-steps here too though - the Mini Uzi sounds like a child's toy for example. The voice talent is varied but too many of the English characters sound like Dick Van Dyke doing cockney. Come on - this is the 21st century - couldn't they get English people to do the English accents?

Single player
Single player mode is a good intro to COD4. The maps are varied and the missions are split between US and UK troops. Each mission is a mission-on-rails in that you really can't deviate much from what the developers want you to do. Go from A to B. Kill everything. Collect item. It's a tired formula but I guess it still works.
Enemy AI is so-so in COD4. There are some neat new tricks compared to other run-and-gun games but ultimately you'll be able to out-think the AI pretty quickly. You need to; there are no health packs in this game. You have overall health and that's it. If you get badly shot up, you can hide and recover, but in a full on smackdown with enemy troops, there's no time to hide so it becomes a question of speed, skill and luck to stay alive.
As I said above, the maps are quite small and confined This is good because it means at no point during gameplay do you ever come across a loading screen unless you change maps or missions. It's bad because you can run from one side of the map to the other in about 30 seconds on the largest map which means there's not a lot of free-roaming capability. The game itself is mercifully short on cut-scenes so there isn't a lot of interruption. The cut scenes that do exist are a split between pre-rendered and game-engine scenes.
The weapons choice is wide and varied and there's an option to throw grenades back if one lands close to you and you have quick reactions. Invariably when I try this though, it goes off in my face and that's the end of that. Each weapon has iron sights or laser / scope / dot sights. Some of the aiming positions are counterintuitive though. The MP44 and M14 assualt rifles have the distinct look of shooting diagonally instead of straight. I've never quite got used to this and if I end up with one of these things, the enemy automatically has an advantage over me.
Without a doubt, the best single player mission is where you find yourself at the weapons controls of a C130 gunship. This entire level is played through an infrared sensor channel. You're orbiting a village and your task is to keep your troops on the ground safe from enemy attack. Your troops are marked with infrared beacons, so they all pulse or flash in the sensor view. You have three different guns at your disposal from rapid-fire machine gun to what-the-hell-was-that cannon. I think if you play COD4 through to the end, you'll eventually only ever re-play this level in single player mode.

Online
Online gameplay is where COD4 really shines in terms of fun factor. Unlike days of old where inexperienced players would drop into maps with 8 year old Korean kids who could snipe them through glitches in the map, COD4 has a load balancing system. As a newbie, you have zero experience points so you get put in games with other people way down the scale. This means you get a chance to learn the maps and figure out how best to play without the frustration of instantly dying because you re-spawned near someone who has a zillion hours of game time under their belt.
The more kills you get, the more matches you play, the more experience points you get. These unlock challenges and the ability to make your own weapons load (instead of choosing one of the predetermined ones) as well as perks. Perks are things like the ability to carry three grenades instead of one. As your experience increases, you get put in maps with other players with similar levels of experience. In this way it leads you into the all-guns-blazing experts-only matches quite gently.

There are a bunch of different online modes ranging from the usual capture the flags (Domination, straight from Halo), to headquarters, search-and-destroy and outright free-for-all and deathmatch. Team Tactical is a neat mode where each time only has three players, so the games become a lot more tactical. That mode also relies on headset chat otherwise you'll be running around completely uncoordinated. COD4 does support headsets chat, but until the first patch came out, there was no way to mute other players, which meant you were treated to levels of swearing that you probably had no idea existed in civilised society. Fortunately, now you can mute the players with Tourette's which makes it a lot more enjoyable. The problem is that a lot of people assume that because they've got an open mic and a captive audience, it gives them the right to behave like a total goon.

There are issues with the online play though. You'll often come across a situation where you are clearly shooting someone else but your hits aren't having any effect. When you die, the replay cam will show you the same gunfight from your opponents point of view and there will appear to be an obvious disconnect between when you thought you were shooting, and when the game considered you to be shooting from the other player's perspective. I call it bullet lag. More often than not it clears itself, but occasionally the online match will just become impossible to play because of it and you have no choice but to exit and join another game.

The biggest drawback of the online play is that the code isn't distributed. This means that one person's machine is hosting the game. If they get annoyed at losing a battle, or being shot too many times, they can cancel the entire match, resulting in a ""host ended session"" message for everyone else. This is really nasty. A lot of games use distributed online mode, meaning all the machines track the progress of the host in case it goes down. If it does, another player's machine becomes the host, seamlessly, and gameplay continues. GTA4 and Racedriver Grid both use this technique to great effect. For it to be missing from COD4 is criminal.
One thing that I'm still not quite used to in COD4 is bullet penetration. Get a sufficiently powerful weapon and a suitably thin wall and you can shoot other players through the wall. A lot of the time it's guesswork, but there are enough graphical glitches that you'll often be able to see another player's knees, elbows or backside poking through the back of a building when they think they're hiding. This is good if you're the attacker, but bad if you're the victim - you can often think you're suitably out-of-sight only to have someone fill your back with lead from the other side of the wall.

Three stars or four?
Very few games deserve 5-star rating at this point. The PS3 is still a relatively new platform and the developers are still learning how best to get everything they can out of it. Giving a game 5 stars implies the developers have nowhere left to turn for future improvements. This happens rarely.
COD4 is a three-star or four-star game but it's hard to choose which. In the end I went with four stars because of the fun factor. It's quick to pick up and the online play, despite the graphical and server glitches, has a high X-factor. It's hard to say what makes the game so much fun but it has that certain something that will probably keep you coming back. In the end, that's what it's all about. You can have all the hype and fanfare you like (are you listening Konami?), but if your game has spectacular graphics, a long and twisting storyline but no fun factor, people won't play it. COD4 has good graphics, good sound, mercifully little storyline and it's fun to play.

The headphones are pretty cheap, I use my own sony's.

Fear part #1:
  It has an in-depth storyline. You get small bits at a time. The action is top notch. The AI works as team against you. You really have think out how to beat you enemy. The slow mo is a big help. The fear elements in the game will scare the hell out of you. You be almost leaping out your chair most of the time. This game really messes with you head. The action never seemed repetitive. Most of the time your look around you won't see what's going on.

Fear part #2:
  The phone messages having info was left out of this game. This really needs it. This game all of your original team died. That was annoying, at least leave some members alive. The ghosts of your original team add some interest. Overall, it was fun to play. The action was again top notch.

Fear part #3:
  You get to play from a different perspective. The action is great. This one fails with the new ultra boss. This is so hard as to take away from the fun of the game. They take a huge amount of ammo to take out. Near the end, you have 5 ultra-bosses in row and little or no cover. A level fix where the door behind you is unlocked will fix the problem. If you play those sections with god mode on, the game becomes fun again. The rats and roaches are a great addition, strangely more roaches would be better.

The whole trilogy is great fun, action, storyline with amazing ai. The action never seems repetitive. The AI will dynamically adapt to you. The AI has a flaw. If someone has a grenade launcher, you get out range and shoot far out. The friendly AI will just stay there and shoot in close, getting killed in the process. You have really keep on your toes with FEAR AI. Fear sets the tone and mood very well. Enough to scare right out your chair and onto the floor.

The trilogy has major failings. The flashlight lasts only a short period. The flashlight runs out. Then you have to wait for it to charge up, then you wait, then charge up, then wait, then charge up, then wait. I found myself getting very frustrated at this stupid flashlight bug. This bug should have fixed before it's public release. The flashlight is only useful if you strobe it. That is really tiring on your hands.

Some enemies take huge amount ammo to take out. Even anti-armor ammo takes an eternity to take them out. Sometimes, you face down enemies with sections with no cover. So, you spend hours trying to get past one section. Some enemies take 30mins to an hour in real time to take out just one.

It fails on another level. Your limited to three weapons. You have to lug your extra weapons 100 feet at a time, back and forth, over and over throughout the game. If you don't, you will run short of ammo at critical moments.

Reloading weapons caused more game reloads than any battle ever did. Fear needed an option turn off reloading. It gets very frustrating.

The game editor should allow you fix the flashlight bug, but it doesn't work. It just says ""filecopy error"" when try to make the fix/mod using their mod maker.

Certainly the problems of this game are not due to the actual gameplay. Gamers will always love AC for the sheer amount of stuff you can receive. You can upgrade to a giant two-story house with a basement. You can purchase all of Tom Nook's and Gracie's furniture and apparel. You can mail-order goods you purchased in the past. You can keep fossils, bugs and fish in your museum. The sheer volume of stuff you can obtain never ends.

No, the big problem is that there wasn't much depth to this game in the first place. Once players obtain all the goods they ever need, there's not much left for them to do but to find more stuff. There's hardly any substantial narrative, so it will never reach the epic scale of storytelling in games such as ""Harvest Moon.""

AC is much easier to play than a majority of ""Harvest Moon"" and other real-life simulators. It's even more user-friendly than ""The Sims."" Characters are never restrained to a short time limit. Since the game clock is conjoined to the actual time and date of the year, players have nearly all day to collect as many things as possible.

But there isn't much inside the actual game that is new. Sure, the city is the perfect place to position Crazy Redd, Dr. Shrunk and the fortune teller. Players can even get their own new haircuts. However, there's no real urgency to find these items because they are available right from the beginning of the game. Even the new items in Gracie's only change every season of the year.

With all this said, though, ""Animal Crossing"" retains its massive appeal. The new Wii remote controls allow players to effortlessly design all their clothes, flags and hats. Fishing is easier than all the other AC games. Even town traveling is incredibly simple if players have a Wi-fi connection.

Just don't expect anything mindblowing. The Wii edition of AC really could have been the equivalent of a real-life chat community, where players interact freely in massive worlds. However, with ""AC: City Folk,"" it's clear that Nintendo wants to keep children safe by limiting the free-roaming range of activities.

4.0,False,"05 3, 2001",A26PAN8REXYBYH,B000059O8B,Brian M. Ranzoni,"I am certainly doing my part to waste time this spring. The Monday before I picked up my computer I snagged a copy of Fallout Tactics from Fred Meyers. An inordinate amount of my time has been sacrificed to complete this viscerally addictive game, to the point my college grades suffer.
 Based on the (insert superlative here) Fallout series of RPG's, Fallout Tactics trods a new direction into the world of ""squad-based"" combat (since a squad is actually a ten to fifteen man unit-- as opposed to six-- it would be more appropriate to call it team-based combat). You are a Brotherhood recruit, the first line of defense against the degenerates of Mid-Western wastelands. You serve a faction of the Brotherhood sent on a reconnaissance mission over the Rockies... only to end up stuck in Chicago. No more. Much has been learned, and it is time to return to California.
 Fallout Tactics arrives on three discs, and since I have the space and RAM to run everything off my hard drive I do not know when or if a transition between discs is needed to play. I suspect three discs are required to contain the quite impressive quality and quantity of sound which shake my sub woofer. Explosions reverberate. Rifles crack. Mysterious objects in the distance squeak and howl. Many areas feature creepy night-time desert wind sounds. And when one crawls through a subterranean bunker and hears the anguished cry of some inhuman thing in the darkness, one tends to feel unnerved. As a cherry on top, Fallout Tactics leans heavily on voice acting. The infamous actor of Full Metal Jacket's Gunnery Sergeant Hartman lends his Marine drawl to General Barnaky, your character's CO. Many other familiar voices will pop up.
 Such characterizations seem to substitute the dialogue screens of the original RPG. Instead of picking witty conversation options, your character simply listens to an NPC-- while subtitles present themselves in a tiny dialogue screen next to a green thumbnail still of the speaker. Such is why I must stress Fallout Tactics is not a role-playing game so much as it is a post-apocalyptic Syndicate. Elements of Interplay's Fallout scheme appear, but it is action and blood at heart, like any first-person shooter. And like British cyperpunk or cyborg-demon shoot `em ups, Tactics obeys a very linear story which moves, moves, MOVES PEOPLE! No side adventures to the Sierra Army Depot or Broken Hills. Every experience is an official Brotherhood mission related to the tale. Virtually all missions involve killing multiple someones... such is life in the Brotherhood.
 Such life means house-to house fighting, bunker raids, sabotage missions, and mazes worthy of the most convoluted Doom or Quake level, only not in first-person. And if this sounds tedious after a while, fear not; for as Tactics declares, life in the Brotherhood has changed. Each level is increasingly difficult and destructive, as your enemies grow in numbers, firepower, and armor far greater than is available to your squad. Ammunition for the best weapons is scarce and by the time you collect a decent amount, the enemy has better armor and you have found a new weapon. Tactics never fails to keep the player on toes and practically falling out of chair.
 Sometimes such challenges border on frustrations. Unlike the RPG's, one has the option of real-time play, where only the use of equipment is governed by action points which continuously regenerate. This is effectively real-time. It also effectively keeps you from laying back on the trigger of your Vindicator mini-gun ala Syndicate. While the enemy can't do the same to you, I always found victory through a superior rate of fire and a large magazine to be a particularly effective means against cyborgs. Ah, but this is tactics, not hitman, and Tactics allows your character to sneak, crouch and belly-crawl. Those of you used to the stand up fights of Fallout will die very quickly. As mentioned, even mere human enemies can frequently wipe your squad out with greater skill and power than you can hope to wield. I have spent as much as an hour attempting to advance six feet. Fallout Iwo Jima would be an accurate nickname for this game.
 To help the uninitiated-or shall I say Initiates- I offer some handy tips.
1. Achieving rank in the Brotherhood is important. Rank allows you access to better gear and team members.
2. All ammuntion aside from 9x19mm is scarce. You will find very few shotgun shells or rifle rounds. Use submachine guns as much as possible in the first two or three missions. Especially save shotgun ammo for super-mutant and robot missions. Once you finish the first super mutant mission, 7.62mm will become abundant, and you will find fair amounts of .50 caliber and 5.56mm rounds.
3. Avoid close combat. Your team is stuck with weak leather armor until you first encounter robots. Most of your enemies will have higher hit points and armor class. I have had human enemies KICK my character to death even as I fired chaingun bursts into them at point blank range. Many of your enemies are so tough, they will actually run out of ammo and charge you before you can kill them. Super mutants and robots also have super tough critters charge you while their buddies fire. Automatic shotguns, especially the Pancor Jackhammer, will decimate close foes. BEWARE OF SCURRYBOTS!
4. Mass sniper rifle fire should be your choice of attack whenever possible. Always have an automatic shotgun or a Browning M2 in your other hand in case the enemy charges. If an enemy is entrenched but cannot detect you, lay mines and toss grenades to save ammo (and your life). Finally, if forced into close combat, use Browning M2s and automatic shotguns, or at least FN FALs and Steyr AUGs.",Fallout: Time Spending,988848000,12,,

It's very comfortable and has a few nice features like being able to change your sensitivity with the press of a button, and multiple user profiles. Most the buttons can be remapped for different tasks, though the default options are typically the most useful. In addition to the normal 3 mouse buttons plus a back/forward button, it has a tactics, profile selection, rapid fire, macro, and 2 sensitivity buttons.

The design is the ergonomic curve that's become popular, but is a little more subtle. The appearance is very edgey, and can even be set to light up when clicking (looks pretty cool in FPS's to see it flash).

The software is a little trickier to figure out, namely when it comes to writing scripts and macros. As it appears, you can only store one macro per profile (which explains why only one button can be assigned as a macro button at a time) and can have up to 4 profiles, yet you can write multiple scripts (I believe up to 8 per profile) to do the same things as a macro, which are activated by a combination of the ""Tactics"" button and a mouse button. Given all that, though, the software for writing the programs is kinda hard to figure out and will take some trial and error.

This mouse is geared more toward use with MMORPGs but also works great for FPS's and RTS's.

Finally, It was cool to see some easter eggs like Kane and Lynch in the game.

I won't give 5 stars to it because even if I'm a fan, I expected a little more in graphic details. The game has some glitches and some missing animations that are not proper of current times. Animations like opening a door or grabbing things should be present on every third person game today. Sometimes also the bodies behave strange. Finally, AI behaves real stupid sometimes. It could be a lot more fun with a better AI for advanced difficulties instead of the same stupid AI with less controls for 47.

I am generally not a fan of stealth shooters, but this game also offers a lot of RPG elements as well as a really good cover system for combat or just sneaking past enemies.  I am doing a stealth-oriented playthrough as opposed to a run-and-gun, which is really testing my enjoyment of the game since stealth is not my srong suit or something I normally enjoy.  Once the controls become familiar, it is a joy to slip between pieces of cover unseen, and the game is fairly generous with autosaves so you can restart just about any room to make sure you complete it to your liking.  Planning on how to tackle a particular area is a lot of fun and the tense minutes while you hack a computer while the enemy's back is turned are pretty exhilarating.

I have also had a lot of fun with the story line so far, hacking computers and getting tidbits of info from emails and pocket secretaries.  The thoroughly imagined world is a major help in the immersiveness of the story line.  The player gets a real sense of being part of the future Detroit where the game takes place.

My only complaint so far is that if you choose to take a stealth-oriented approach to the game, it is difficult to develop much weapon proficiency by the time you get to the first boss.  He is a tank, and will require you to make the most of each bullet and grenade in your inventory.  This can be a frustrating revelation for someone who has spent the first 10 hours of gameplay barely firing a bullet and mostly doing silent takedowns.

Overall though, it is a well-designed game with a great attention to detail.  Graphics could be a little better, but with the amount of content available in this game, there had to be a tradeoff somewhere.

You can switch out your guns for different ones of your choosing when you come across certain ""special crates"" scattered around any given level, which is nice because that means you can switch up your play style when YOU want too.  The single player campaign is short and sweet (prob 8-10 hours play time), the story doesn't grab you like MW2's, but enjoyable none-the-less.  Assuming that the bulk of people buying this game are doing so for the multiplayer, i'll move on to that and devote the rest of my review to it.

I downloaded the demo for this game a little while ago and hated it.  The controls were completely different then MW2 - i especially dislike that they use the right movement stick for ducking.  Can't tell you how many times i try to shoot a guy and ended up ducking and shooting at the same time.  So i put it away and went back to MW2, as i was playing i realized that - ""i hate this game"", i'm at the 4th prestige and have over saturated myself with it. I cant stand the quick kill quick death formula anymore, the horrible spawn system, the team selection system, and especially the lack of team work i constantly come across.  There is also the infamous ""MW2 law"", similar to ""Murphy's Law"", where anything can go wrong in a match and when it does, it always seems to happen to YOU.  Ofcourse MW2 is a great game and a worthy purchase, but i personally have had my fill.

That being said, it was unfair to judge BFBC2 so quickly when i had put such an insane amount hours into MW2.  So i picked it up again and gave it another shot...i was hooked!  I was playing as a medic and realized that i actually wasn't focused on killing people, i was running around reviving my teammates and dropping health packs to keep them going, ofcourse i took out a few stray enemies here and there.  ""Wow, this is different"" i thought, and when i realized how many points i was racking up i liked it even more.  I""m actually HELPING my team and getting a ton of points for it.  That brings me to the most important aspect of the multiplayer, you are actually encouraged to work as a team, which is a nice change of pace compared to MW2.  I get just the same amount of points for shooting someone as i get for reviving them.  It works beautifully.

There is a leveling up system which is similar to MW2, nothing as developed though, but there is enough there to keep you coming back for more and you do unlock different sights, guns, gadgets etc...  Some are just for the particular class you use i.e - medic unlocks larger health packs, but others are more general and can be used for any class, i.e - heavy vehicle perks.

The first BFBC had 2 deal breakers for me.  One was their crazy health system where you jam a needle into your stomach when your health got low, which ofcourse is something you would have to do 50 times a match.  The other was the lack of any kind of kill cam!  It's no fun being sniped over and over again and having no idea where the sniper is when you respawn.  THANKFULLY, both of those deal breakers have been removed.  Your health regenerates (no needle to the stomach required) and there is a kill cam, you don't actually see the enemy kill you like in MW2, but you follow them around until you respawn so you know where they are and can carry out the proper justice.

Also, locating enemies is somewhat unique to this game, when you see an enemy, you have to press the back button on your controller and then a red insignia appears over their head and they show up on your entire teams map for a brief amount of time.  I can't express how gratifying it was to spot 3 snipers on a hill, press the back button, and watch them get lit up by my team - rockets, bullets, you name it, it went their way.  Also, you get assit kill points for things like that, again, encouraging team work.

BFBC2 is a great game, very different then MW2 but in a good way.  If you need a break from MW2, give it a try, you won't be disappointed.  Again, one of the most impressive things about the multiplayer is how it rewards you for team work and incourages it.  If actually playing a first person shooter AS a team, not just ""lone wolfin it"" while you're IN a team, sounds good to you, pick this game up, you won't be dissapointed.

I gave this game 4 out of 5 stars because it's not perfect.  What game is?  I have experienced some issues actually getting into a multiplayer match (can't find a match, busy, error, whatever,it means that their servers are full and they can't handle it, and several matchs have ended abruptly due to server issues.  But once you actually get into a match, it's a ton of fun.

FYI:  Snipers, snipers, snipers!  What is the deal, everyone and their Mom wants to be a sniper.  It seems that atleast a third to half of the players in the game are snipers.  Not sure why, they always have the least amount of points and seem to stay in one spot most of the game.......i digress.  Switch it up!

***UPDATE (03/14/10)***

I've been playing this came for quite sometime (all medic, recon, and heavy vehicle upgrades have been unlocked), i must say that it has held up well, although some of its flaws are more noticeable, nothing major per say, but worth mentioning, 1st one being the most important.

1)It's much easier to be a skilled pilot then to be a skilled engineer w/the rocket launcher.

Apache helicopters with missles are extremly unbalanced.  What i mean by that is it is far to easy for a skilled pilot to get an insane amount of kills, to the point of feeling unfair because it's so hard to take it down.  None of the rocket launchers ""LOCK"" on, yes you can guide the rocket, but you can't actually ""LOCK"" on, which is frustrating.  When playing 'rush' on the map featured in the demo (the snow map which takes place during the day), there is a powerful Apache on that map, but you're given a good amount of tanks which help with taking it down, so it's not that extreme.

But......

This unbalance issue is taken to a whole new level on the map consisting of the 3 islands (with an autumn backdrop), when you're playing 'rush', the defenders are given an EXTREMLY OVERPOWERED Apache helicopter when/if they reach the 3rd island.  I've played 2 games thus far where my team was about to seal the deal and take the 3rd island when the defenders hopped in that freakin apache and annihilated everyone, it got so bad that most of my team dropped out, including myself.  No point in playing any longer when you've died 5 times in a row because the apache is hovering over your spawn base firing rockets at you as you spawn in.  I equipped the engineer class and so did half my team and we were shooting rocket after rocket trying to take it down, nothing was working.  By my 5th death in a row, of not be alive more then 30 secs, i dropped out.

The first time it happend, it was extremly frustrating because my team was actually good, everyone was playing their role well, that's why it seemed extremely unfair.

The second time, i knew the drill at this point and gave it 5min, if it wasn't taken down in that amount of time, we dropped out.  At that point, it just becomes a waste of time.

This is by far the biggest flaw i've found in the game.  Basically, you've invested 20-30min to get that far in a match, then putting all player skills to the side, it boils down to who can get to the Apache first.  They need to either lower the health of that particular Apache or make the rocked launcher system easier to use against it, ie-better guidance, tracking, more powerful, something!  It just seems incredibility unbalanced.

2)Spawning is a lot better then MW2, but could use a bit of work.

I was playing a 'rush' match and my team was defending and we were actually able to jump the spawn base of the attackers and smother them the entire match, they didn't get to set one 'com station' off, seemed unfair for the other team, we shouldn't have been able to do that.

Also, i've spawned into mortar strikes twice (spawning on a teammate), that was purely bad luck on my part though, nothing against the game.

3)Match making protocol can use some work.

I've found it useful to hit/hold the 'back button' when i first get into a match because some of the time i find that i'm put on a team that only has, let's say 7 people, compared to the other team which as 12.  Or i'm put on a team where the top player has 500 pts and the other teams top player has 1600 points, usually a good measure of how ""good"" your team is going to be.

Again, my rating still stands, it's a great game and a ton of fun, just be aware of the 3 island map playing rush, try to get to that Apache first, if not, be ready for game over.",Oh so refreshing!,1267488000,111,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

In favor is a straight out DDR game a basic progression system, classic DDR gameplay with the addition of double mode for the Wii, and a set list of 80 plus songs that will rock your world!

The main star in this one is the music list which consists of the typical licensed pop songs from the likes of Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez, Bruno Mars, Natasha Bedingfield (she probably gives Konami favors to put her songs, catch my drift?), Donna Summer, Ne-yo, etc. Compared to last year's game, it's a hell of a improvement with a higher focus on today's high energy pop songs than 2010's DDR full of songs you'll find on a soft rock radio station. The new songs from Konami's house are your typical entry of songs from the usual suspects such as NAOKI, jun, DKC Crew, Bill Hamel, TAG, TOMOSUKE etc. The rest of the list, which encompass about half of the game consists songs that players wanted from last year's DDR game, DDR X2 songs. These songs are Konami Originals as well as the BEMANI crossovers.

About 30+ of the set list has a full version playable song. Now Konami would have artificially increased the 80+ song count by counting a song's short and full version as two separate songs, but no, they didn't.

And fortunately, there is enough material that comes with the game to make a wide variety of productions. The tools available in the ""sandbox"" mode of the game are fairly simple to use and allow for a lot of creative expression. The story mode of the game, while interesting for a few hours, is actually the weak link. But I assume that the average person will buy this game for the movie-making ability, so the story mode's limitations are fairly easy to look over.

Gameplay: There are two gameplay modes: story mode and sandbox. The story mode starts you off in the 1920s as an up-and-coming studio manager. You are responsible for building up your studio lot with various buildings, sets, decorations, pathways, and so forth. Also, you have to staff the studio with builders, janitors, crew members, researchers, directors, and, of course, actors. This has to be done on a budget, so you'll have to manage your money wisely. The overall goal is to produce films that gain experience for your actors and directors, get good ratings, and receive awards (which are given out every 5 years). As you manage your studio over time, new costumes, sets, and props become available allowing for a greater diversity of artistic creations.

Overall, the story mode serves as a very long tutorial for the sandbox mode. Some people will be put off by the tedious nature of the story-mode gameplay. Much of your time will be spend on micromanaging actors' attitudes, repairing buildings, hunting for new recruits, and the like. After about 3 hours, it really can get mentally numbing. However, the developers of the game made playing the story mode necessary, since you can only have access to certain props, sets, and costumes in the sandbox by playing through the story mode.  Thus, expect to play through 20 hours of the story mode before unlocking all of the sets and other things.

The sandbox is really where the game shines. This is where you can make your own movies. Rather surprisingly, the process is quite straightforward. The tutorials and in-game instructions are very good, and there are tons of scenes, props, costumes, and other times. A very nice element of the game is the star-maker program, which allows you to model the face and appearance your actors. Movies can be as simple (and rough) as you want or as sophisticated (and time-consuming) as you desire. In essence, you create a movie by stringing together pre-set scenes which you can change in a number of ways, including length, intensity, lighting, weather, subtitles, actor positions and expressions, and so forth. You can even add voices and music if you'd like. There are some limitations. For example, you don't have full control over camera angles, and you can't determine precisely where an actor will be in a scene (you have a few pre-set options). Still, there is an incredible amount of potential in the tools and material that you do have available. To get a sense of the possibilities, take a look at some of the 4- and 5-star movies at [...]

Grapics: The visuals are good overall. The actors do have a somewhat cartoonish quality about them and can seem awkward on occasion.  Still, there's nothing quite like seeing an actor, whom you just spent a half hour creating in the star-maker program, walk into a scene. It's really a magical gaming moment. The sets look pretty good, as well as the props. Also, the scenes and technologies seem appropriate to each era of film-making. I wish that the game had a mini-map for your studio lot, so that you could instantly jump to a particular building (instead of having to scroll there). Also, the lot should have been expandable, since you'll have it covered with buildings in no time. Still, the graphics are good enough to allow for some fairly immersive gameplay.

Sound: All of the music is good and appropriate, from the music played during game installation to the in-game tunes. There is some voice acting in the game, but not among the actors themselves. There are a number of sound effects that can be added to movies. Also, you can add your own voices, music, and effects.

Replayability/Technical elements: The game has huge replayability. No two people will experience it the same way, at least not in the sandbox mode. You are largely limited by only your imagination. The instruction manual is pretty good, and the in-game tutorials and instructions are great. If you want to jump into the game, you could figure it out fairly quickly. The game seems well polished, even slick in its presentation. It did crash on me once, but only after a 8+ hour session (you can save all of your film work, sets, actors, etc.). There is a patch available, which I recommend.

Overall, I thought that this was a worthwhile purchase. The story mode could have been better, but the sandbox mode easily makes up for it. If you are interested in a game that allows you to direct, cast, and produce a movie, this is it. It's not perfect, but it does generally fulfill its promise. I hope that there is an expansion forthcoming which add more props, costumes, sets, and the like, along with better control of the camera.",Fantastic idea ... good execution,1139961600,5,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

This one will be no different, however I urge you to try this game for yourself...even if its just a rent.  You may dislike somethings, but at least you won't miss an excellent game altogether!

I must say the visuals are absolutely mind blowing!  The dust and particles blowing in the wind and around the shanty's is downright
amazing.  This brings me to my first category:

Graphics/Visuals: (A+) If your a fan of COD4/5 photo realistic environments, RE5 is going to blow you away!  The details in everything from the small puddles of water to the wood grain on doors and planks honestly takes you right into the game!  The blood, and liquid properties of things are spot on, and really take gaming to a new level!  If your into stunning graphics or need something new to show off that HDTV, this game will sell it!

Sounds/Surround:  (A+) This is one of my favorite new features of ""next gen"" games, the surround sound is so important and just adds that level of realism, especially in games like RE!  The crunching of sand under your feet, the banging of angry zombies on wooden doors, your partner opening up a fully automatic weapon behind you in the distance...all promise to keep you playing on the edge of your seat!  I was very impressed with the sound of this game, hearing hordes of zombies coming right at you (front speakers) and the loud shout of your comrade telling you to ""watch out"" (rear speakers) all of this combined with snarling zombies, and random 9mm rounds popping...incredible!

Gameplay: (A) Okay I broke this down into two sections multiplayer co-op(MP), and single player campaign(SP)

MP-Playing RE5 co-op with a buddy is something that has never been done before in a RE game, and believe me it is an excellent addition!  Having to help a real person playing along side you and vice versa is nerve racking, hearing your friend yelling into the mic ""hey I got 3 more coming on my right can you get em"" is just something you don't get when the AI player cries for help.  Its so nice, helping each other and actually talking about solutions, and what way to go next...however its a double edge sword. (read SP)

SP-While playing with a buddy is awesome, SP has some perks also.  You'll be controlling Chris, while Sheva is computer controlled (for the most part) The real bonus to SP campaign is Sheva talks and gives you little ""hints"" as to whats next.  I found it kinda nice at certain points of the game where your just completely turned around with no clue where to go.  Personally for me though if you got the internet, and a buddy with RE5...go with the CO-OP, the end experience is hard to beat!

Controls (B/C) This depends on what kinda games your used to.  If you find yourself playing strictly first person shooters (CoD, Halo) this game WILL take some getting used to.  Its a slower paced action than your used to seeing in FPS games, but if you have the patience to learn your gonna be in for a surprise.  You can not reload or shoot while moving, which many people have complained about.  While this is frustrating at times (namely when a mob of zombies is headed your way and your mp5 is dry) it adds to the urgency of the moment!  Make sure your gun is always reloaded and get some distance between you and the enemy (remember that spade shovel they got reaches a lot farther than your knife also) Watch your partners back and hope for the same from them and I promise you will have a great time with this game.

All in all I give this game a 9.2/10 with the controls being the only thing you need to get used to, but not a deal breaker, or a reason to overlook this amazingly well told story.

4.0,False,"07 2, 2008",A7OE4WU1V8IK1,B00004SVS5,I.M.J,"My first foray into the MM series was with MM 2, the flagship installment of this series. That sent me on a hunt to find MM 1, which did not hold a candle to it's successor. A friend of mine then beat me to the punch (18 years ago) and bought MM3. I was already a huge MM fan after only having played MM2 but MM3 only strengthened my allegiance.

MM3 follows the same basic premise as the previous two installments: beat a robot master and gain his powers to defat the next. The main antagonist is still Dr. Wily (when will he give up?). MM3 is much longer than its predecessor as you are forced to defeat a doppleganger-like robot that takes on the powers of the 8 robot bosses from MM2 in the Spark Man, Needle Man, Shadow Man and Needle Man stages. This is actually pretty annoying, but it was nice to see the old crew again! The 4 extra levels notwithstanding, I thought MM2 was tougher for some reason.

This game continues the high precedent set by MM2 (outstanding gameplay, phenomenal music, etc) and builds upon it by giving the Blue Bomber a slide move, which works to get you into tight places and as a speedier alternative to the standard running. This game also marks the first appearance of MM's dog Rush, and he proves to be very useful. Rush can take on the functionality of a jumping board called Rush Coil, which you are outfitted with from the jump. He also takes on the form of a jet (Rush Jet) and a submarine (Rush Submarine). In this installment, you are allowed a maximum of 9 energy tanks, which is a bit of overkill for the regular bosses but comes in handy in the final stages.

MM3 continues the tradition and there is no deviation in gameplay other than the new slide move. Nothing groundbreaking here, but then again, if you are considering a MM title, you know (and love) exactly what to expect.",Mega Man Strengthens His Stranglehold,1214956800,,,
4.0,True,"11 13, 2011",A2JQWSA0GPVSQN,B00503E8S2,ManUPT,"From start to finish Modern Warfare 3 has me hooked to the story and the fast paced improved multiplayer. The Campaign is very exciting and it is very long too which is something I love. It is 17 missions to be exact. If you have played Modern Warfare 2 you need to at least rent this for the campaign because this might be the last Modern Warfare. The campaign has a certain feel to it that no other game is able to match. The slow-mo shooting, the ""OMG"" moments that makes your jaw drop, and the wonderful graphics that are hard to say are better than Battlefield 3 but have at least improved to a satisfying point that any Call of Duty fan will love. The multiplayer is much better with new game modes, kill streaks, maps, better servers, and very addicting. The guns are very different from MW2, BF3, Black Ops, it is something completely new. The guns are much better, cooler, and updated. The only gun to come back is the UMP and it is 1 of the guns you start out with and will probably want to end with if you used it a lot in MW2. It is probably the best sub machine gun, but not the best gun. The new thing that I absolutely love is guns ranking up. Every time your gun ranks up you get something new. An attachment, a perk for the gun, a camo, it makes the game better for people who stick to the same gun. The perks are mostly the same except for overkill which allows you to have 2 primary weapons which is good for someone who snipes cause he can also use an assault rifle or any other gun they want. The maps range from very small to large and they are all very fun and easy to adapt to. It seems kills are easier to get in MW3 and it is much faster than MW2 or BF3 but that is a plus for me. The new kill confirmed game mode is extremely fun for people who hate snipers camping. Every time you kill someone you get xp, every time you pick up a dog tag you get xp and a point for your team. It is a very smart idea and is very fun.

And I like the fish car. :P Anyway, steering using the Wii-mote (only) is cool, but if I want a chance at winning, I must use a Gamecube controller because it has the Double Dash layout which I loved and can work with. Note that this was my first time playing it Saturday and I enjoyed it so, but I really couldn't get the hang of it with a Wii-mote alone. Don't even get me started on trying to turn and drift at the same time. Can't get used to it!

And I'd imagine it'd be tough for young users to play this game with a Wii-mote, but maybe I'm wrong. Maybe if they are good at this game, they can dominate just like the best of them.

I'm usually really good at all of the Mario Karts but I'm just not that great with the Wii-mote.

But enough of the blab.

This game starts out with about 12 characters, and has 24 or so in total (including King Boo who is heavy, but cool otherwise). The racing levels range from new, and mostly exciting ones, to older ones giving you a feeling of nostalgia, to totally horrible tracks like Rainbow Road. Yes, in general, that's usually a hard level, but this one is RIDICULOUS in its difficulty. There are so many unnecessary loops and turns it's quite disheartening for nearly anyone. Congrats to anyone who can dominate on this track.

This game is the first to add bikes (which I don't really use) and tricks which are fun to pull off. You do tricks and you get boosts, but they are only done off ramps, or like tree roots.

On a side and seemingly unrelated note, I loved Smash Bros. Melee on the GameCube. One of my favorite games on the system. Then the Wii comes along with Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Mario Kart Wii.

Which is the better of the two? For me, it was Mario Kart Wii. Although both are fun.

Is this game better than the SNES one? Yes, to me.

Is it better than the Nintendo 64 version? Well, it looks better and doesn't have any glitches in it, so on that note, yes. But I didn't play battle in this one so I can't speak on that. We'll just say that it's at least on par with Mario Kart 64.

Is it better than Double Dash on GameCube? Yes, yes, yes!

Mario Party 7's gameplay is chaotic and there are so many chances of getting unlucky rolls and losing everything. Overall the gameplay is light and fun like all Mario games are. Me and three other friends began to play and experienced some interesting features that we never experienced five years ago when we played the first Mario Party-

1. There are six boards, but in several stages obtaining a star changes. In Windmillville, instead of buying stars for 20 coins, you ""invest"" coins in a windmill, and the one who puts the most coins in it controls the stars in that windmill. In one turn a skilled player can topple the game. Fun.

2. Orbs (items) are weird and there's a variety of them, including one ""specialty orb"" based on your character. By either using certain orbs on yourself or throwing orbs on spaces near you, it can cause harm to whoever passes it or lands on it, depending on the orb.

3. There's an option called eight-player mode where two players can share half a controller and there are twelve of these games designed for eight players (either four teams of two or a eight-player-royale). Most of these games are simple but still fun.

4. Secret stuff is hard to get. A 20-turn game will earm roughly 400 mileage points (unlocking Birdo and Dry Bones cost 1,000 each), but winning a Solo Cruise game (you vs. CPU in mostly duel games) gets you roughly 600. There are some secret games that cost 3000, so getting those will take many hours.

5. The microphone is handy and is prepared to ignore any distractions from shouting friends. Though possible to play without, it adds interaction to the game. The one problem is that there is only one Single-player Bonus Mic Game where you memorize fruits, so it gets repetitive.

6. Donkey Kong is no longer a player, but when you land on DK spaces you can win coins or possibly stars if you beat him in a DK Duel Minigame. Sometimes there are Multiplayer DK Games, where everybody wins! There are 12 playable characters, Birdo and Dry Bones (a skeleton Koopa?) must be bought.

7. In Minigame Cruise, there are five various competitions in addition to simply playing minigames. My favorite is the Decathalon, where four compete in 10 specific Minigames (all must be unlocked) and get points based on performance.

Well, Sleeping Dogs *is* nearly as good as GTA and that's saying a lot coming from me. Personally I think it's more similar to GTA IV than any other game. To many, that's an insult. From me, it's very high praise. The only real flaw I see here is that the driving is a tad wonky, with twitchy steering control. It takes a lot of getting used to. So did GTA IV's driving, but once I was used to it I thought it was arguably the best driving control and physics outside of a few dedicated racing games. I really don't see that happening here. The fact that there's no option to switch to a first person or on-the-hood camera is an unforgivable sin. I can understand why they don't do that in Saints Row, but there's nothing stopping them from implementing it here. All of the driving mechanics would still work perfectly well, including the ""Action Hijack"" feature where you jump from your car to another. That's what the green arrow icon is for, after all. In the final analysis, this is the closest thing to a ""major flaw"" I can think of. It doesn't really make a dent in the overall awesomeness of the game. The relatively small city and lack of flying vehicles are non-issues.

The combat is more focused on hand to hand than gunplay. As I'm sure many others have said, it's pretty similar to the Arkham games. Another good comparison would be Assassin's Creed, which also emphasizes/rewards countering incoming attacks rather than simply attacking on your own.

The icing on the cake is the dialogue. The voice acting in general is surprisingly good. A lot of random dialogue is surprisingly hilarious. The kung fu instructor is a particular favorite, e.g. while you're hard at work training against a bunch of his students, he suggests that you previously studied martial arts at ""the School of Never Winning"" and that you worship ""the God of Weakness"".

All of that said, while I still wouldn't call these ""major"" flaws there are a couple of things that do annoy me a little:

* Disappearing weapons- In this game, weapons are basically treated as temporary power ups. Melee weapons break after you use them too much, I'm fine with that. But guns just mysteriously disappear from your inventory for no apparent reason. I get what the developer was trying to do, i.e. keep the focus on martial arts hand-to-hand combat. But artificially limiting what the player can do is anathema to the whole sandbox game play philosophy. It's about letting the player do what they want to do at all times. I can honestly say that I probably would have kept my weapon holstered and used martial arts for most of the combat, because the game has a robust combat system that's fun and satisfying. They should have trusted in that. It's just annoying that my weapons kept magically evaporating into thin air between missions. Breaks the immersion.

* Another immersion breaking problem I had was too much ""warping"" around the world. i.e. A cutscene plays out with dialogue which indicates where to go to begin a mission, the screen fades to black, and then suddenly I find myself halfway across the city, at the location. No, no, no. Just tell me where to go and then let me get there on my own. Add some kind of fast travel option for people who prefer that, but don't force it by default. This is basic sandbox game design, guys.

Bottom line is that you get a nice decent sized city to mess around in, the missions are engaging with good variety (aside from standard combat ""go to location X and kill person Y""  there's hacking cameras, tracing cell phone calls, unscrewing air vent covers, planting bugs, etc.) the side activities are plentiful and fun, everything looks great, they did a good job on the music... it's just an excellent high quality package in general.","You look like you need a pork bun.

So, when I say I was able to play the entire game with almost no 'hints' you get an idea of how relatively easy it is. That's not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, I preferred it over the completely illogical and complex Myst-type puzzles.

The story was a bit hokey (and that's being kind) and I don't understand why they had to ""hunk"" up George. If I'm not mistaken, in the first Broken Sword game he was a bit of a bumbling nerd -- but charming and at least not an Indiana Jones clone. And does every female character in these games have to look like Lara Croft, with the obligatory short shorts???? Let's try something different once in a while!

Still, that didn't detract too much from the fun of the game. Oddly enough, once I got used to the controls, I didn't have any trouble moving the characters around and I thought the graphics were very well done for the most part.

I did have a few other 'pet peeves' I need to get off my chest,  such as:

a) Nico's constantly stretching and flicking link off her shoulder -- these gestures were annoying and distracting. Was the stretching some adolescent male programmer's idea of sexy, perhaps?

b) no way to bypass certain cut scenes so if you did ""die"" you had to sit through them again (and again and again).

c) when both Nico and George appeared together, the graphics were terrible. She kept disappearing and reappearing, flicking around the screen, etc. Not a glitch, exactly, just poorly done.

d) too many dumb ""move the boxes"" puzzles. For once, I was good at something and by the time the end game came I though if I had to shove one more box around the screen, I'll kill George and Nico myself and align myself with Sussaro (the bad guy).

Okay, lots of pet peeves and complaints ... but I still give the game a 4 since, compared to so many other adventure games, it had enough good moments -- at a good price -- to put it ahead of the pack.",Good ... not great,1113350400,25,,

The reason is simple: character choices. It's not that there aren't enough characters to choose from, cause there are (however Capcom has had years to develop this game and easily could have included more), however its the fact that some of the characters that ""made the cut"" are just plain...weird. M.O.D.O.K? Seriously? Was there really a NEED to put him into the game? Taskmaster? I don't recall people lining up begging to have him as an addition to this widely anticipated release. However, despite some of the character selections currently available (omitting current and upcoming DLC characters of course), that's not what this game is all about, is it? No, it's about having FUN, and when it comes to having FUN, this game definitely delivers! The graphics are absolutely top-notch and the colors displayed on-screen are simply breath-taking. The online mode is pretty good as well, however I do have one minor complaint in that when you join a lobby (a type of mode that allows you to join with up to seven other players to fight against), you aren't allowed to watch the match that is taking place between two of the players within your lobby (if that makes sense). This is one of those cases where it would be much easier to see it than to explain it through text. However the bottom line with that is, you end up (sometimes) with a lot of idle time while waiting for a match to start (unless you enjoy staring at a dull screen until your time to fight commences). Each of the characters bring to the table their own unique fighting styles, some are more powerful, some are quicker, and some are ridiculously slow (a-hem...Arthur), however the developers at Capcom did a great job in balancing this all out (in my opinion).

Having said all that, I definitely am impressed by what this game has offered so far, and I look forward to what lies ahead as far as future DLC is concerned. So if you're ""on the fence"" about picking this one up, I'd say at the very least, at least rent it, and if it turns out to be something you'd enjoy, buy it!

Anyways, I thought that it was so much fun. It's a very unique style of game play where you don't actually have to do a majority of the work. You just send your minions out to terrorize the town. I played it for about a week before I got bored, but I think I almost beat it. Even though it got boring to me, I still think it's a really sweet game and it was worth the money. I'll probably start to play it again after a few weeks so it will be fresher to me. I think the reason it got boring is that the upgrades are really limited and the gameplay gets really repetitive. And, a lot of times you have to use a particular type of minion to beat a level, but they're not avaliable on that level, so you have to go back to a previous level and kill enemies until you get enough minions built up. It's really annoying and repetitive. I constantly found myself shortchanged with my minions and they weren't avaliable enough throughout the game. Still really fun though, so I recommend at least renting it.
FYI: There's three types of armor you can get get throughout the game; there isn't that much game play in between the upgrades, so I'd recommend just saving your minions for the final armor upgrades.

It may not be a perfect game, but IJ&tET is an incredibly exciting and action packed game.

I won't go into the plot of the game.  There's too much of it and not enough time to waste reading about it.

Pros:

Kick-ass action.  The hand-to-hand-combat is terrific.  You have your left hand and your right hand with one fist a piece.  There are a lot of fun combos you can use to attack your enemies.  Grabbing makes it even more enjoyable as you grab an enemy and punch him like he's got Everlast written all over him or you can throw him against a wall and make mince meat out of him.  Not to mention the shoulder grab and multiple knee to the gut attack.  There's also the ability to guard yourself with those fisticuffs of yours.  Did I mention how much I enjoy wailing on Third Reich fockers?

The talent.  Top-notch voice over actors do a terrific job bringing the well written dialogue to life.  It's a great story as well and worthy of the Indy series.  Indy's voice is very close to Harrison Ford's.

The look and sounds.  Stunning environments and characters.  I love the designs created.  I especially liked the buildings in Istanbul (not Constantinople).  This game is very detailed yet runs flawlessly on not-so-up-to-date PCs like mine.  I enjoyed all the sound fx of the weapons.  They sounded authentic and added to the action.

The weapons.  Oh my.  The whip.  It is so much fun whippin' baddies with it.  You have plenty of guns both pistol and automatic to shoot anything with which includes sharks and alligators.

The action and adventure.  So much fun.  Every turn is an opportunity to swing off of ledges all over the place with your trusty whip.  You climb, jump, sommersault and hang onto / off of and flush against ledges way up, up in the air (acrophobics might get a tad freaked at times).  Plenty of puzzles and hidden gems abound make it more fun than a barrel of snakes (""Why did it have to be snakes?"").

GUI and controls.  Very easy to read and use and to set up.  All the settings are customable to your liking except that the game doesn't recognize extra buttons on the mouse other than the basic 3 and the wheel.  Not a big deal.

Cons:

Control.  At times the controls can be jerky.  My main issue is the auto-controls.  The character sometimes goes in another direction than you may want.  Very annoying.

Camera angles.  Frustrating.  The auto-camera turns away from you or just does its own thing and can be very disorienting in the most inconvenient of times.

Secrets.  There are assumedly a lot of them but aren't easy to find with the annoying camera and the lack of a ""searching"" option.  Eh.

Saving.  Biggest pain-in-the-tucchus.  You cannot save where you want.  There is only the auto-saving at the end of each section.  This really is the biggest issue I had with the game.

All in all it's super fun and more exciting than most games.  It really does bring you into the adventurous world of Dr. Indiana Jones (Jr.).",I Luv Pummeling Nazis!!!,1148774400,,{'Platform:': ' PC'},
4.0,True,"12 12, 2016",A2XN8YOJ16WAVM,B00BMFIXOW,A. N.,"I played the first and second AC games but never bothered finishing them because they rapidly became insanely boring and repetitive.  Then I took a long hiatus from the series until I decided to give Black Flag a try, several years after it was initially released.  I am very glad that I did.

Black Flag is a vast improvement over the earlier games (at least the first two; I can't speak to the others).  The open world is very fun to explore, and engaging in sea battles and taking prizes is surprisingly amusing.  I have spent hours just sailing around and plundering every ship I can find, taking every fort I come across, and just generally being a pirate.  It never gets old.  The main storyline is solid so far (I haven't quite finished it).  Combat on land seems improved, with a nice mixture of weapons.

That said, some of the same issues that plagued the earlier AC games still exist.  The most serious is the controls.  Just like previous versions, your character will be dashing ahead and then suddenly he'll start climbing up the side of a structure or a wall precisely when you don't want him to.  Or, you want him to climb up something but instead he'll start climbing up and then suddenly will jump off in the opposite direction.  For the most part it's a minor annoyance, but in a few instances (when trying to run from combat, for example) it can become insanely frustrating.  The second huge issue I have with the AC series is the whole stupid animus thing.  It's a dumb concept and it's clunky in execution.  At certain points in the game's progress you'll suddenly be yanked out of your awesome pirate adventure and forced to walk around Abstergo hacking into computers by doing stupid mini-games.  I just want to be a pirate, okay?

Overall, Black Flag has proven to be extremely fun and a worthy time sink.  Like Shadows of Mordor, this is a game that you can have tons of fun just doing side quests and having a good time killing and plundering across the open world.","Avast ye, matey!",1481500800,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The night before this came out I preordered it off amazon.  I was expecting some type of detailed and entertaining storyline.  You basically have a series of slightly related missions in the single player mode.  It's based off of the current war but the cut scenes don't tell you much about the basis of the war and the objectives you are about to complete.  Where as COD and BC had very detailed and drawing stories and characters.  You never play the same person twice in a row.  After each set of ovjectives is completed you are in someone elses shoes being called by a nickname of a different name than you were last time.  You have to move WITH the NPC and don't have the option to explore otherwise.  I know it is suppose to be more realistic, but it is still a video game, and you don't seem to unlock any new gear or weapons when playing single player.  You request ammo off of your squad.

Multiplayer mode is ok.  The maps are pretty good BUT you don't have a chance to do much more than kill between one and three guys before getting your head blown off by a sniper.  If you are playing a sniper, it takes about 3 shots anyway to actually kill someone, but it doesn't register on their screen that they have been shot three times.  There are obvious glitches that come with any game.

Long story short, expect simple, main streamed missions in single player mode with very little freedom to complete the objective your way. Everything is guided by a NPC.  And Multiplayer is cool, but there is much better out there and it is a constant respawn every few minutes ( sometimes spawning in the map) and that's not because I am not good at FPS, I am very good at them, better than I should be for my age, but the set up and range of damage for the guns vs real time play is just off.

I followed the directions on the razer site and once I got everything done and I thought I was in the clear, I rebooted and I could never get the mouse to be seen by the drivers. again.. so I started searching for fixes and read this is an issue with these mice.. great! I returned my last razer mouse because the drivers were buggy.. sort of the same issue also, wouldn't detect the mouse sometimes.. anyways, I see not much has changed. But I was determined to get this working because I fell in love with the feel of it.. So, I did get it all working finally, but this what I had to do:

--> uninstalled all Habu software..(which is just the driver pack)

--> installed the 2.01 drivers from Razers site from a clean slate.

--> said YES to the windows warning about non WHQL drivers

--> then said NO to the reboot now option and went into the firmware folder (part of the driver pack) and installed the new firmware!! (with /no/ reboot).

--> after the firmware is successfully installed, it tells you to unplug and re-plug the Habu.. do that, /then/ reboot.

NOTE: It's very important to not reboot before attempting the firmware update because the OS and the drivers see the mouse ONLY after the driver install but after a reboot with the old firmware the mouse was never detectable by the drivers again.. it was very frustrating! anyways.. it seems any of the Habu/Razer drivers will only detect a mouse after a reboot with 2.01 firmware installed. My mouse had 1.0 firmware..

I as I said, and the more I use it the more I love the feel of the Habu.. so much like the old IME 3.0 which I still adore.. the only mouse which really just felt like a key in a lock with my hand. The buttons click is awesome and the wheel is PERFECT (resistance for up/down and depress center). The side (thumb) buttons come with an alternate panel which has the two buttons more out of the way.. I have yet to try it but that's a nice extra.. the mouse tracking is spot on! very precise and very smooth.. me likey!

giving it 4 stars because the mouse is awesome now that I have the drivers working, but wow that was frustrating.. it's a mouse for crying out loud.. it should be a no brainer install. whew.

Instead of the the racing cars you're familiar with we get futuristic hover-racers that blaze across futuristic cities in an effort to come out on top. Couple this with the techno soundtrack and detailed graphics and you get one heck of a ride. As someone who doesn't normally play racing games, I was surprised to find myself enjoying this as much as I did.
WipEout 2048 introduces you to a futuristic world full of fantastic skyscrapers, intense vehicular battle, techno-style music, and high octane races that leave you with a sense of accomplishment after completing them. The gameplay starts of easy, you a few races that teach you the mechanics of gameplay, including racing and combat. The controls work well, with only a few times I found them to be a bit clunky. The level of difficulty increases dramatically a third of the way through the game. I found this to be a bit jarring, as did other reviewers, but it didn't detract from the fun for too long. Vehicular combat is fun, it gets more difficult as you progress. A few times it took me a few tries to finish a level, but this wasn't a frustrating experience at all.
The graphics are good, on par with some console games. They are detailed and I experienced very little slowdown while playing it. The soundtrack is very well done as well. Heavy techno beats and electronica help set the futuristic tone of the game and help get your pulse pounding while you're trying to come in first place.
There are a few flaws to this game. The load times are very long. 50 seconds to a minute for each track. The developer are working to fix this with an upcoming update and I will update my review once they do. Another flaw is the difficulty spike a third of the way through. While this isn't exactly a flaw, it is a bit jarring to the player.
Overall this is a fun and excellent launch title for the Vita. Anyone who has ever been interested in trying a racing game should give this a shot. WipEout 2048 shows what the Vita can do, and I'm looking forward to the next WipEout title for it.

Ahhh, COD.  This one is a great game, but its a bit short and some of the missions fall flat.  I'll be brief since a lot has been said already.

The game stands up to the original, and in my opinion best, game of the series.  Were it not for the novelty of the original this game might surpass it.

Its a lot shorter, and for that it gets 4 stars.  Also as in the original, some of the missions, notably the marine missions, fall flat.  They are good, but don't stand up to the British missions.

Where it excels is in the story, which is coherent and all the roles you play contribute, and makes some bold narrative choices that stand out.  At least they are trying.  It also features a superb, if slightly overblown, opening scene reminiscent of the original half life, which sets the tone.  Its your typical run and gun COD experience, with a couple of jaw-dropping missions that are just terrific in execution.  The ghillie suit mission stands out, as does a night raid featuring incredibly atmospheric lighting courtesy of grenade launched flares.  Another plus is the lack of rails missions which I always thought was a weak point of the series.

Otherwise all the elements are there:  graphics, controls, teammates, etc.  Really just a great gaming experience.",2nd best in series,1197072000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I've played the battlefield series of games since Battlefield 2 first came out on the PC and I've been hooked on them ever since.  I would have reviewed Battlefield 3, but there were already so many reviews that what I had to say had already been said.  BF 4 has some of the same glitches as BF 3 did on launch.  This one hasn't had as many for me as I had with the launch of BF 3 though.  The game locked up (froze) on me on launch day once and it locked up on me once on the second day of release also.  With that said I remember several lock ups with BF 3 on launch amongst other things as being stuck on or in an object within the map etc. the first month or so after release.  I honestly believe that BF 4 was created for the PC and the next gen consoles and that is why we have the frame rate drops when there is a lot of action going on around you in BF 4 on the 360.  For the most part I have really enjoyed the changes in the game i.e. tanks are harder to kill with rockets and the interaction with the environment.  You have buildings you can totally collapse killing anyone left in it, on it, or in front of it; you have flooded areas that if the supporting structure is blown up by someone, you will be killed by the impact of the water and debris - there is also other maps that have similar interactions with the environment.  Unfortunately though, at this point (as others have mentioned) you can't form a squad with your friends in order to launch into a game together.  This is a real pain the butt as you then have to find an empty server then have them all join on you.  This is something that really has to be fixed and I will also post this issue on their Battlelog web page.  The Dice team has been pretty good in the past with listening to the issues we have with their games and they patch it.  Even though there are bugs that need to be fixed, which is common on launch with most games - I still really enjoy BF 4.  Once the issues are fixed I will probably upgrade ""my"" opinion of this game to 5 stars, but then again I will have the Xbox One on the 22 November, so I won't be playing BF 4 on the 360.  In closing I believe this is an excellent multiplayer game with some launch day issues that need to be fixed.","Needs some launch day fixes, but still an excellent multiplayer game",1383177600,,,

Well, to a degree it is, but it's also its own game too. Obviously you will notice that the graphics are in the Grand Theft auto cartoon style... Otherwise it's a new ballgame.
One noticable difference from GTA is the lack of freedom. This game is very focused of action rather then walking around a giant environment. You do get to walk around town a bit and talk to locals, but don't expect to be free roaming and shooting innocents like GTA.
Also, the controls are much more complicated then GTA. The most noticable thing is no auto aim. It takes a little while to get used to moving your character with one control while trying to aim with the other, but don't let that keep you from buying the game. The controls for the most part are tight and once you get used to them, the game will seem easy.
If you love Clint Eastwood Style westerns or you just like bloody violent video games, then this is a essential title to pick up. You get to live all the quintessential and classic moments from western films, such as saving the train from being robbed, massive shoot outs in the ghost town, bar room brawls and more!

I had never experienced such a giant playground version of an open world game before, but open world action is my favorite genre so as one could imagine, i became the equivalent of a 'kid in a candy store.'
Now that Far Cry 4 has released, I was expecting and hoping for more of that same experience but also with the 'next-gen' treatment.  That's EXACTLY what FC4 is!  what an outstanding game this is, graphically it may be one of the most beautiful games i've ever seen.  This game is very similar to FC3 regarding the mechanics and gameplay, but that's honestly what a true Far Cry gamer wants.  There were numerous complaints on game websites I frequent to get my information before purchasing, but quite honestly why would that be a negative?  I find the transition so much easier and pleasurable as well.
There are much more collectibles and side missions this time, and honestly regarding the extra missions...they are just more fun than the last game.
The characters are very credible and likeable as well.  Excellent storyline with main mission choices to keep away from a linear campaign, outstanding graphics with gorgeous weather effects (the snow!!) and almost realistic day/night patterns regarding the lighting.  The combat is much improved and more diverse, and also offering more weapons and options than in FC3.
I would have given this 5 stars except for the fact that I struggled to enjoy the multiplayer modes. that was a letdown becasue I read great things about how unique it was going to be, but I felt the maps were a little too big for a 6 vs. 6 style factions format.  I also heard that the co-op was not the most developed type of experience either, but kudos to the development team for trying their best!

The series had some hiccups in MK3 which were further aggravated by UMK3, and then the series really hit rock bottom in the ""adventure"" games.  Deadly Alliance definitely brings the game back to a high standard level.  The graphics are incredible, sound is dead-on, and the gameplay is quite good.

In fact, it is just an add-on pack for anyone not familiar with The Sims or its army of expansion packs. But Makin Magic doesn't have to be revolutionary, because it provides a great experience for all fans of The Sims and is a great showpiece for the seventh and final expansion pack in the franchise.
Makin Magic continues the great tradition of The Sims games, and now it gives the series something new. Although the title suggests primary focus on a magic-oriented theme, there are really three categories:magic, carnival or circus, and haunted house. The haunted theme is great because the game was released just a couple of days before Halloween of 2003.
The game adds many great new objects including a magic stand, roller-coasters, and spooky objects. The game also improves upon the series' already phenomenal sound, with creepy but fun tunes to listen to while you play.
One of the best parts, however, of Makin Magic is its new location, Magic Town, and its atmosphere. Magic Town, simply put, is awesome, and it is my favorite part of the town. Keep in mind, that also includes downtown, old town, vacation island, and studio town. And so far, I had been finding myself creating new lots in every expansion simply because the lots that Maxis released were boring. There is no need to create new lots in Makin Magic, because the pre-made lots are very, very cool!
For any fan of The Sims, makin Magic is a must-have, especially if you can get it at a good price. It is my favorite expansion next to Hot Date, the best expansion for any game, ever, and with The Sims 2 just around the corner, Makin Magic and Superstar will keep you very busy until then.

Presentation: Firstly, you should know that this game is around 60 GB, with only 7 being on the disc you just paid full price for. You will not be able to play this game right away. I could go on and on about how angry that makes me when companies put out a physical product and it is so lacking it's borderline criminal, but I guess that is the state of industry at the moment. I mean Witcher 3 had a fantastic box and extras and you didn't need to wait a day for gigabytes and updates, and it sold like hot cakes. Secondly - the actual box the disc comes it may quite possibly be the most flimsy, unprotective ""case"" I've ever seen. Also enclosed are two pieces of paper, your code and an advertisement. Needless to say I was not impressed and will definitely take that in consideration of any iD games I buy.

Game: I've spent around 5 hours or so with the campaign and multiplayer and both are overall solid. The campaign is actually kinda fun in a dumb, mindless sort of way. The story is paper thin, your some  random guy with no motivation to kill random demons in a story that seems like was already told through the first 3 games. I mean Doom 3 I remember this exact same storyline, but it was actually creepier and scary. This makes up for that with gameplay. I love the twitch feeling and dodging monsters and making kills all on low health and ammo. I'm not 100% sure about the checkpoint system but I guess it does make it a bit more challenging.

The multiplayer you can tell was made by another company. It's missing that polish and tactical feel from the main game. All the maps are crappy box type layouts with none of the beauty and graphical prowess of the main game. Animations and movement of other players are crap. Though there is some fun to be had if you can get passed the polish of the game. I don't think this will have a place in my multiplayer FPS rotation, but there will be some fun to be had here and there.

Overall I don't feel like this is a full price purchase. With prime I get a 12 dollar discount so that makes the game about worth it, but if you don't have prime or buying it from the store it's not worth 65 bucks to me, more like a 45 price point or lower. The whole 50GB download thing really put a damper on my experience for this game and I couldn't imagine waiting 10 years for a sequel and it being so lackluster. Don'tget me wrong though the game is fun to play and I did have a good experience with multiplayer I just don't feel like it's justified at the full game price point.

I don't know why companies think people want to download 50 full gigabytes of data just because it's ""digital"". Why would I buy the damn disc just to download FIFTY GIBABYTES OF DATA?? If you sell a disc, which you should PUT THE GAME ON THE DISC, not a measly few gigabytes then spend the whole night downloading FIFTY GIGABYTES OF DATA,

I'll update this review when I finally get to play the game, but for anyone looking to make a purchase you just as soon buy it now through steam and set it download overnight. The box is actually one of the most flimsy things I've ever owned, it almost feels like a JC Penny gift box. There's a few crappy slips of paper advertising your FREE PREORDER DLC and one disc. The disc has just a few gigs of data and the rest you must wait to download. I don't understand why companies think digital is the way to go. I want to at least own something for 60 bucks.

Although you can download games to the virtual console portion of the Wii using a credit card, you can also choose to purchase a prepaid points card, which you could use instead. It is simple, convient and secure to use for those who are too afraid of using a credit card for buying things off the internet. I definitely recommend this for anybody who wants and owns the Wii.

4.0,False,"11 17, 2005",A1W0ODR0SK9H4R,B00007KQC4,LeftManOut,"The remake of the original Resident Evil for the gamecube was nothing short of amazing. Resident Evil 0 followed the innovations that had been made with the original remake, and further expanded upon them. So naturally when I heard Resident Evil 2, 3 and Code Veronica would be making their way to the Gamecube I had high expectations. However it became clear that these would not be the same great remakes that they were first perceived to be. In fact they weren't remakes at all. Capcom simply ported all three of the games to gamecube discs, and then released them for $40.00 (!) each. That's a steep price considering most of us played this game when it was originally released on PSX back in 1997. The motivation behind these ""re-releases"" was simply to introduce the entire series of Resident Evil games to the market who may not have played them on the Playstation, but had played the original remake or Resident Evil 0 on Gamecube. While you should not buy this game if you already own the original on the PSX (like I said it's the same EXACT game), if you never played the original RE2, then this is a good chance to get to know this classic.

About the game first. This is indeed one of the highlights of the Resident Evil series. Most fans regard this as the best RE game to have ever been released. While I'm still partial to RE 1 myself, I would have to agree on some levels that indeed Resident Evil 2 is the series' shining point. The innovative idea of having the two main characters' stories (Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield for those who haven't played) intertwine with one another was genius. In reality you can play this game 4 different times (2x with each character) and get a somewhat different story line each time. To fully appreciate this game, you have to understand the time it came from. In 1997, graphically this was one of the best games to ever be released on the playstation. The zombies were scarier than they had ever been in the original game, and the environments that Capcom created for the city were genuinely creepy, not to mention introducing new enemies like the licker. The FMV sequences were stunning for the time, and really propelled the game into the position as front runner of the ""survival horror"" genre. Leon and Claire were rendered perfectly, and their interactions with the surroundings were stellar.

Control wise the game is exactly like every other RE game you've ever played. The GC version simply uses the control layout found in the RE remake and RE 0. At first to those who haven't played a RE title before, the controls may seem awkward, but since I'm guessing that most of the people who bought or are going to buy this game had played at least one of the Gamecube RE games, there should be no problems for anyone. The controls do take some time to get used to, but they quickly become second nature, and after you've played at least one RE game, you should instantly pick it back up every time you turn it on.

The story found in Resident Evil 2 is a definite highlight. Basically following the incident that happened at the mansion in the first game with Chris and Jill, the T-Virus has been released into Racoon city, and zombies are now walking the streets. Fate brings together (and quickly pulls apart) Leon Kennedy, a rookie police officer from the Racoon City Police Department, and Claire Redfield, the sister of Chris Redfield from the first game, who is determined to find her missing brother. They both understand they must get out of the city alive, and after a car crash at the beginning of the game, they are forced to go their own ways (more will make since if you play the game, I don't want to ruin the story.) From there both pretty much have to do their best to stay alive, while finding other survivors, and making their way out of town. However that's no easy task.

Now on the reasons to buy or not to buy. If you never owned the original Resident Evil 2 on PSX, or don't own a playstation 1 or 2, then I guess this is a good game to buy. However the $40.00 price tag is pretty ridiculous, seeing as this game is almost ten years old. If you can find one for a reasonable price (around the $20-25 price range) then I would recommend you get it, especially if you haven't played this game before. It is truly one of the most innovative installments the series has produced thus far, and is a must play for fans of the RE series.

The thing that really bugs me about this release is that Capcom had so much that could have been done with this game, but simply chose not to. Ok I understand not reworking the story, or adding new areas and stuff, but at least touch up the graphics, and make stuff faster. Lets be honest, this game looks like it came from the stone age compared to anything that's on the gaming market right now, and it's pretty lame that Capcom didn't at least make an effort to make the game better. Had they have done that, it might have made this purchase necessary. However since they chose not to, this is a skip, especially if you already have it.

Still even though Capcom put no effort into this re-release, I still have a hard time giving this game a bad score because I love it so much. This is still one of my favorite games from the series, and was truly a masterpiece when it came out 8 years ago. If you somehow don't own a Playstation one, and you have never played this game (and you can find one for a reasonable price) this is a great buy, because the game is definitely a great piece of entertainment. I can't help but feel a bit of resentment though towards Capcom for doing this, especially to die hard fans like myself who played the original on the Playstation years ago. Basically this game is only a ploy to get those who were new to the series to buy the re-releases. You've been warned. Still a classic game though.","A Classic Game, But A Lot More Could Have Been Done With This Release",1132185600,4,{'Platform:': ' GameCube'},

The world is well fleshed out, and the tech element to it is believable, quite immersive really. There's a ton of stuff to do, side quests, mini games, I have no idea, there's a lot of stuff. Going to try the multiplayer tomorrow.

Now I'm going to list a bunch of cons, and I really hope they update this game soon. The controls for this game sucks. It's so unrefined, the driving in this game is by far, one of the worst for open world, it's like driving a super fast boat that has horrible handling, and this game has a lot of driving.

There are random physic glitches that would cause me to fall (for instance, getting out of a slightly moving car) and it would take forever getting back up that during that time I'm gunned down and I have to retry mission.

This game lags randomly, but I guess the spec requirement is pretty high.

Running, i7 2600k, 2x 8gb ram, gtx 670 ftw and ssd and it lags on high setting.

I would recommend this game because of the sheer amount of content but be prepared for the typical frustrating ubisoft game controls (assassin's creed type moments), if  you're not in a hurry, wait for it to get updated.

I love this game despite the crappy controls, but it is day 1, so I'll have to wait for it to get updated... hopefully I won't punch my monitor before then.

This game has loads of charisma, and lots of fun, funny characters.  They have funny voices, and smart alec remarks when they win and lose.

Quick load times, and fast screen changes.  Reminds me of the Casino set up at Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball, for the X Box, if you've ever played that one.

The One arm bandit machines are a little bleah, but no big whoop!  Still fun.

The card games are where the table action is, and it's fun to gamble with somebody else's money (virtual money) and when you lose, you just turn off your PSP.

Graphics are great, with ""caricature"" drawings of the people playing games with you.  Blackjack is my game, but they include Poker, and War!  And many others.

Buy this game from this site, Amazon.com and get ready for hours of enjoyment!

4.0,False,"11 29, 2013",A2DOTE0Y3SY7M2,B00DBRM3G8,Paakaa10,"Sporting King James on its cover and featuring a marketing push focused on the #Reign hashtag, its clear that while 2K Sports might only have one sports game left in yearly development, it is fully committed to it and feels nothing short of swagger about the one title left standing.  With EA SPORTS entering into a strategic partnership with Microsoft in advance of the launch of the Xbox One, NBA 2K14 became a focal point in Sonys pre-release demonstrations and packages advertising the PlayStation 4, and with good reason.  Of the sports titles available for the launch of these consoles, NBA 2K14 may be the one which pushes the envelope the most from a visual standpoint, joining FIFA 14 as titles which do the best at showing off the potential of the next-generation of sports gaming.

As somebody who, as stated in my impressions of NBA LIVE 14, is not the biggest fan of basketball and has not played a full retail version of a basketball video game since the days of Segas ill-fated Dreamcast console, Ive long been ignorant of the experience of an NBA 2K game.  Ive known through word of mouth that the series has been a highly-regarded element of sports gaming in general, but Id never felt the need to experience it for myself.

With buzz at a fever pitch for NBA 2K14 going into the launch of the PlayStation 4, it became relevant and appropriate to me to try my hand at the first entry of this franchise for next-generation consoles.

What was the result of my first foray into the NBA 2K franchise since the Dreamcast days?  Read on to find out!

Gameplay

Getting into NBA 2K14 for the first time, I was happy to find an in-depth tutorial and practice mode to play around with in order to come to a working understanding of how the game works on the court.  Although the games reliance on Right Analog Stick controls can be hit or miss with players based on their comfort level with using them in other sports video games, the best part of the experience is that the buttons are typically used as redundancies for the stick controls to give the user options.

Players in NBA 2K14 have a consistency in motion and momentum which feels really good on the court, and helps to guide much of the gameplay experience.  Players of different sizes and speeds control differently, but they all feel consistent in what you can and cant do based on what the player is doing.  This physical grounding in reality helps the basic foundation of the game from the start.

On offense, passing and shooting is straightforward and icon passes can be triggered as well to give the user added control over their pass targeting.  The game features a meter incorporated in the player control indicator which updates real-time to show the user how comfortable the player in possession would be taking a shot from that part of the court, which helps the new user get used to NBA players on the rosters.  When shots are attempted, there is instant feedback on both the shot selection and the release on the shot attempt to help guide the user as to whether they are making appropriate shots in the game.  While there are some occasions where a shot will be a bad selection and bad release and still find the netand vice versa, where great shot selection and release can bounce off the rim and go out of boundsin most cases, this tool helps introduce new players into the mechanics of the game on offense.

The game also does a good job of helping new players run plays, as pressing the L1 button in possession will call a Smart Play and circles on the court guide the user to move their player around the court and make passes appropriately to set up better shooting opportunities.  Veteran players can call their own plays as well, with the same level of guidance to help the process.

On defense, tight player control helps marking an opponent play out better than in the competing game, even though steal attempts are liable to end in fouls for players who don't understand the rhythm of the game on defense.  Blocking can be hit-and-miss as well, for much the same reason with regard to rhythm.  Player physics are pretty solid, however, so interactions happen appropriately and foul calls seem to be consistent with what plays out in the game.

With all of this being said with regard to solid gameplay, the game seems oddly unforgiving of players who are not ready to get on-board with NBA 2K14 and its intricacies.  For the Initial Impressions articles Ive written on both NBA LIVE 14 and NBA 2K14, Ive been playing the game on each games Pro difficulty level; a notch above the lowest difficulty, and a notch below the median difficulty.  In NBA LIVE 14, games are typically more tightly contested, with victories happening with final margins in the 5-10 point range.

In NBA 2K14, multiple games on Pro difficulty have ended in losses of around 20 points.  Typically what happens is that once I as a user start missing shots and having failed possessions, the AI is able to score all too easily and start building momentum on a run.  The result is a quick deficit which forces me to take lower percentage shots from three-point range in a vain attempt to get more points to get back into the game; because these shots are poor, possessions remain fruitless and the deficit grows ever larger because the AI is so effective at converting their own possessions.

I am aware that many will read this as the complaint of a bad player at the game, but the truth is that Im not opposed to being held to a higher standard as a player to find success at a sports video game.  Indeed, I commend NBA 2K14 for committing to a depiction of the sport which requires players to be well-versed in basketball to find success on the virtual court.  It just feels as though there might be better ways to ease players into the experience in having the AI play more forgivingly at Pro difficulty.

Difficulty concerns asideparticularly for new playersthe gameplay of NBA 2K14 is clearly the result of many years focused on gameplay refinement; even new players can appreciate the way the game feels on the sticks as soon as its booted up.

Presentation

Despite not having a deal to use real-life broadcast branding, NBA 2K14 is no slouch in the presentation department.  The commentary team of Kevin Harlan (from TNTs coverage of the NBA), Clark Kellogg (CBS college basketball commentator), and Steve Kerr (former player and most accurate 3-point shooter in NBA history) dazzles with over 50 hours of recorded commentary, helping the game feel dynamic with stories about the game, the teams involved, and the players; as well as comments on recent results and statistical trends.

Courtside reporter Doris Burke also gives voiceover reports as well as halftime and post-game interviews with key players and coaches using real audio recorded from actual games in the interviews through the Real Voice feature.  While these vignettes are typically not very longone has to imagine that the recorded sound bites are short across the boardthey definitely contribute to the overall broadcast atmosphere.

In stark contrast to NBA LIVE 14s reticence to embrace post-play instant replays, NBA 2K14 seems to revel in these opportunities, using many different styles (including but not limited to: spotlighting the key player by having them in color surrounded by black-and-white, measuring the vertical leap of a player on a dunk, or featuring the Sprite Slam Cam from behind the backboard) to convey the feel of a NBA game broadcast.  Even when you think youve seen all of the different styles of replay available, the game can surprise you and use a style not seen before or shown in a different manner to keep it fresh.

The game features pre-game broadcast lead-ins, a halftime show, and post-game coverage which are strong across the board.  Even though there is no branding outside of 2K Sports and some companies like Sprint, there is a clear visual continuity to the broadcast elements which creates a flow throughout each game.  Also impressive are look-aheads to future games on the schedule during quarter breaks or stoppages in play, enhancing the feel of each game of NBA 2K14 feeling like you're watching a real game on TV.

Basketball is a sport for which style holds great importance, and presentation in NBA 2K14 fully embraces this style to create a unified experience which complements the titles gameplay.

Graphics and Performance

As stated before, NBA 2K14 is one of the launch titles for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One that seems to truly be making use of the new technology from a visual perspective.  Players on the court are easily recognized as their real-life athletes, to the point where at times the uncanny valley effect is remarkable.  Even the stadiums, courts, and crowds are impressive, and populated by quality character models which complement the look of the players in the action.  Where even big-name players in NBA LIVE 14 can sometimes look off, NBA 2K14 does not have this issue.

The performance of the game is also admirable, keeping a consistent frame rate and featuring quality animations.  If there is one complaint to be had with regard to performance, it would be that after a shot is made, there are times where the camera switches to a tracking shot showing the team running back on defense which can feature awkward animations as the players run back to the defensive side of the court.  In a game which tries so hard to be photorealistic and replicate the NBA in video game form, moments like this break the desired immersion and serve as an unfortunate reminder that it is not a real-life broadcast.

The actual physics of the ball are also quite impressive in NBA 2K14, with more outcomes resulting from shooting attempts and a greater sense of looseness in rebounds and passes compared to the competition.  The ball feels much more active coming off the rim on missed shots, which makes the game feel more organic while also reinforcing the on-screen shot feedback to help guide the player in understanding why shot attempts aren't going down for points.

All in all, its hard to find much to complain about for NBA 2K14 from a visual standpoint; it is truly one of the showcase games for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in this respect, and could be recommended for purchase just to show off improved visuals on next-gen consoles alone.

Features

If there is a category that NBA 2K14 suffers in, it may well be in terms of the features offered; this is not so much an indictment of what can be possible in the game, but instead of what is lost to the consumer when the game cannot establish a connection to the 2K Sports servers.  Unfortunately, even weeks after the launch of the PS4, it is not guaranteed that the 2K Sports servers will be online to avoid these limitations of the game.

When the game does connect to servers, the player has access to NBA Todaywhere the days games can be played with appropriate commentary and stats to that point in the seasonas well as Quick Play games.  The user can also start a MyCAREER mode where they create an athlete to work their way up from the draft showcase to NBA stardom in a story-driven mode with cut-scenes, voice acting, and multiple choice decisions along the way.  For fans of team career mode, MyGM mode exists and allows a similar experience of taking control of a team as GM and interacting with your teams owner, players, and the press at various points in the course of the season through cut-scenes and multiple-choice responses.  Finally, MyTEAM mode functions much in the same manner as Ultimate Team mode in NBA LIVE 14, where card packs are purchased to add players to an all-star team of athletes for use in various gameplay experiences.

Unfortunately, many of these features go away if the connection to the server cannot be established; at that point, all thats left to play is essentially a Quick Play game; even basic modes which one would think should be playable offlinesuch as the player and team career modescannot be accessed at all without an established server connection.  Considering that NBA 2K14 is not marketed as a game requiring a persistent online connection, this is problematic.  Many players will likely be confused as to why basic features of the game are not available, not thinking that lack of online connection should have such an impact on the game.

On the subject of what can be done in the game in general, one area in which NBA 2K14 lags behind all of the other sports video games around today is in the general design of its menus.  Although Id not played a full basketball game since the Dreamcast days, navigating menus in NBA 2K14 had me feeling right at home, as the menu design feels like its approaching a decade or older in being behind.  At times it feels as though 2K Sports could do right by its fans simply in putting together a manual for how to navigate the games menus and find features, just so that any user can sit down and actually find all of the things advertised as being part of the NBA 2K14 experience.

Online play includes head-to-head matches as well as a new mode called The Park where users can bring their MyPLAYER characters into something resembling a MMO and take part in (or spectate) pickup games in a park, but reports abound of players having difficulty accessing this mode and I have not personally been able to access it myself at the time of writing this to give any feedback on it.

Since NBA 2K14 is so reliant upon a connection to the 2K Sports servers to access even basic parts of the game experience, even users with good internet connections are not guaranteed to be immune to these issues.  There are certainly a multitude of ways to experience NBA 2K14, but the game does a poor job making them available at all times to all users.

Overall

At the end of the day, NBA 2K14 is a game which can be easy to recommend to people who have upgraded their home consoles to the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One.  The gameplay experience is among the best in any sports game available on the market, and the game looks gorgeous as a showcase of what can be expected from future titles on these next-gen consoles.  Presentation is also a strength, and one wonders what the development team might further accomplish if they were able to use authentic branding like TNT in creating the broadcast experience.

Unfortunately, the steep requirement of being able to connect online to access so many of the features of NBA 2K14 is a definite weakness.  Until 2K Sports is able to resolve server access issues, theres no guarantee at any given time that every feature advertised as in the game will be available to be played.  That might be enough of a deal-breaker for some consumers to sit back and wait for greater stability before buying in this year.

For fans of the NBA, its a clear choice to be made to have a video game on the PS4 or Xbox One this year; NBA 2K14 fits that bill.  But with basic access issues plaguing the game at times, one has to hope that 2K Sports will learn from an uneven launch and be able to make the entire feature set available offline by the time NBA 2K15 launches next fall.","Strong next-gen showcase and basketball debut, hampered by restricted features when fickle server connection is lost.",1385683200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The PSP version does have some changes (both positive and negative). The cutscenes are very well done. All of the dialogue in the game has been re-translated, as well. The new translation does decrease the charm slightly, but also makes the story more understandable.

The main problem with the PSP version is the slowdown during animations. The frame rate gets down to around 10FPS during some battle animations-- this really reduces the quality of the experience.

4.0,True,"01 27, 2003",A27RFBMPCWGZSZ,B00006LU9C,Jason Waldman,"""Panzer Dragoon Orta"" is the kind of game that makes you thank god you have an Xbox. It is hauntingly beautiful yet filled with enough action to keep you interested.
The game is the latest installment in the ""Panzer Dragoon"" saga, which was about the only decent thing on the Sega Saturn. You basically fly around on a dragon, killing enemies and fighting huge boss battles. In this game, your dragon can assume three different forms, and you can switch between them at will. Each form has its own strengths and weaknesses, meaning you actually have to employ some strategy to get through most of the levels.
The gameplay is very strong. This is a rail shooter, so you move along a path for the whole level, like ""Star Fox"" The controls are also simple to understand. You hit one button to shift between forms, another to use your special ""berserk"" attacks, another to dash and brake, and another to shoot your gun or use your homing lasers. You also can easily move the camera around with a tap of the L or R buttons to face enemies faster. The enemies are widely varies and provide enough of a challenge to engage, but not frustrate, the average gamer. The boss battles are really things of beauty. You have to find the weak point of each boss by flying around using your dash abilities while dodging attacks. In later stages, this requires a lot of work, as the weak point shifts and you have to use different forms to beat a boss.
Graphically, ""Orta"" is as good as it gets. Each level is like a piece of art and each individual enemy is extensively detailed. The bosses are simply huge and well-designed, providing enough eye candy to almost make you forget that you're about to be fried by a huge energy beam. Soundwise, ""Orta"" is a little disappointing. The music sounds very much like the music in the original ""Panzer Dragoon"". Even some of the sound effects remain unchanged.
Speaking of the original game, it's include on here, along with five short bonus missions and a sub-scenario about a boy who's father was killed by the dragon. They're fun to play, as you get to pilot different vehicles and go through new storylines.
The main reason I didn't give this game five stars was because it is much, much too short. I appreciate all the extras, like the encyclopedia and still art, but a lot of that memory could have been used to add more gameplay. I beat this game in less than a week, and I wasn't even playing as much as I usually do. If Sega comes out with a second game for the Xbox, it needs to have at least twenty levels. You also come away from this game at the end feeling a little unsatisfied at the ending.
Overall, this is an outstanding game that deserves to be a part of your library just so you can say you have it. But, like a ""Far Side Gallery"" book, it doesn't take very long to finish.","A Fantastic Game, but Much Too Short",1043625600,20,,

4.0,False,"09 22, 2008",A1XWQ13VJDOQ7C,B000R0SS3Y,Mahalins,"Let's face it, hype is no good for any game. All hype really does is infect people with this stupid notion that the game will be the be all end all of gaming; the greatest game ever made. And then, when the game is actually released none of their expectations are filled, and so everyone is disappointed. Especially if the game concept has been in development limbo for years. Despite what most people will spout out, the current version of Too Human was actually conceived three years ago. The *idea* of Too Human was conceived almost 13 or so years ago, but that hardly matters since the Too Human on the shelves is a much different beast entirely.

Too Human received mostly average reviews from professional critics, and even some downright negative reviews, though I have to disagree with everything they have said. In truth I think they didn't understand the game, nor did they have the time and energy to actually put some time into it. To be fair, the game does no hand holding of the player, and pretty much nothing explained. Heck, even the game manual doesn't explain much. No, the player is left to their own devices to figure out the game and the strange controls. And I can certainly see why some people would be put off by this. Too Human isn't your average 'hack n slash' game like all the reviews are claiming it is. In fact its quite original. For one, all of your melee attacks are set to your right analog joystick; tap once and your character slides to an enemy in the vicinity and sends them flying up into the air. From here you can jump up with them and juggle attack them for some serious combo damage, or you could pull out your pistols and fire away. Also, the camera is fixed, giving way to some awesome cinematic moments, and some great frustration. By pushing the Right Bumper you can align the camera behind you. It would have been nice to have an option to fully control the camera, but like I said Too Human is not your average 'hack n slash'. Thirdly, the game places a lot of focus (read: A LOT) on armor and weapon customization. The options are literally endless. Depending on how fast and how skillful you kill an enemy they will drop armor, weapons, powerups and even health (read: loot). The faster and more extravagent you are able to dispatch an enemy rewards you with some awesome loot (good armor, good weapons etc), while the longer you take reduces these chances. Some enemies drop nothing. Its a game of chance, really. But this makes the combat fun, as you never know what treats you will end up with once the smoke clears and your foes are laying in a pile.

Too Human's story is rather interesting. The game takes place in a world where Norse Mythology and Cyberpunk meet. The world has been wiped clean by evil robots (ruled by Hel and Loki), and humanity has been relegated to a single outpost/city that houses the Gods as well. The Gods are cybernetically enhanced beings and they run the gamot of Norse Mythology. You play as Baldur, brother to Thor. The two main enemies are Loki and Hel (Loki's daughter). Overall the story is average, with the best parts happening at the very end and setting up what I think will be an amazing sequel.

When you die in Too Human, Valkyrie come down from the sky and take your body to the afterlife. This involves a 15 second death animation, one that frustrated many players and reviers alike, but they probably didn't understand the reason for the super long death animation. You are supposed to be punished for dying, since it is very possible to make it through each level without dying. Since good loot is set on a timer essentially, when you die you are forced to sit out for 15 seconds, thus worsening your chances of good loot. Its very unforgiving, but hey so is life. The trick is to...not die; To use strategy and to fully learn the controls. If you can't manage this, then Too Human isn't the game for you. Remember, it is not your average hack n slash game. You can't get by with just spamming buttons. You have to know what you are doing.

And you will probably die a lot, that is if you just barrage through the game without learning the controls, effecively managing your weapons and armor, runes etc. In fact, a good chunk of your game time will be in the menu screens, swapping out armor, checking stats, and changing weapons. This may sound boring to some, but Diablo and Balder's Gate loot lovers will love this aspect. There is nothing greater than getting an awesome loot drop after an epic battle; The spoils of war. When you die, your armor and weapons take damage, so if you die a lot you will have to keep swapping out your weapons/armor because once they reach a certain point they will not work so well. The trick is to keep from dying, like in any other game.

For enemies, they come at you in hordes. You will almost always find yourself up against 10 - 15 enemies at once, sometimes including really tough mini bosses. Some of the enemies shoot arrows and some shoot rockets. Many times you will find yourself faced with 15 + enemies, all the while rockets and arrows are flying at you. It can get pretty tough, but if you know your controls then you will have no problem.

In Too Human there are only four enemy types: Goblins, Dark Elves, Trolls and Undead. While this may seem very limited its actually pretty awesome. There are different variants of each enemy type. Some will be aligned to a certain element, like Fire or Ice, Poison or Energy, while others will be aligned with none. Then there are the light/dark variants which are immune to certain attacks (light enemies are immune to ranged attacks while dark enemies are immune to melee). All in all there are enough enemy variants to keep things very interesting, and the real trick of combat is to figure out the best approach and the best attack.

Too Human is broken up into four maps (dungeons or levels, if you will), and one main hub, which serves as the city or town for the game. Here you will be able to buy/sell/repair weapons and items, use the weapon/armor blueprints you find during missions to make new weapons, and further the story along through cutscenes. The one thing I didn't like about Too Human was that you cannot interact with any of the city/town folk. They are there to pretty much serve as scenery. Sometimes they will engage in conversation with one another and you can listen to it, but it would have been nice to be able to actively talk with them like an RPG. There are only four levels/dungeons/missions, but they are pretty long. Each mission has 3 - 5 stages in it and a final boss at the end. Not to mention the myriads of mini bosses throughout. The level design is pretty awesome. Eerie cyberpunk-meets-mythology level design and some really good looking graphics make trudging through each level a visual joy. On each level there are 'secret battle arenas' that can be entered by finding a secret passageway. In these arenas you will be faced with either a time challenge, or simply a massive amount of enemies. Defeat all the enemies in the time alloted (for the time challenges), or succesfully kill all the enemies (every other challenge) and you will be rewarded with great loot. However, if you die in the process you will lose the arena and not be able to access it again. Like I said, Too Human is very unforgiving. In addition to the secret arenas there are ""cyberwells"". These wells lead to a place called 'cyberspace' where Balder can learn powers and interact with objects to make things happen in the game world. The powers you learn will only be useable in 'cyberspace' and are more puzzle oriented than anything. Basically, you will go into cyberspace and have to find a way to open a door or a bridge which corresponds to the in-game world. Once you do this, you can advance the level. While it could have been a neat concept it really comes off as filler (think the explorable planets in Mass Effect).

On to the loot: There are thousands of different weapons, armor and power ups to find in Too Human, and you will definitely not find it all in one play through. Every weapon and armor item is leveled, and each has its own buffs and perks. The best weapons/armor in the game are called ""Elite"", which offer up the best stats. Its also the hardest to find. Alternatively you can find blueprints for Elite armor and weapons but it costs a fortune to make. There are so many weapon/item customization options that the possibilities are literally endless. Now, being that this is a fantasy game the weapons and armor have hilarious names like 'Jotun boots of blinding speed"" etc, but its really fun collecting all of it, selling what you don't need, and getting the truly awesome Elite armor/weapons.

Your character levels up with experience points as well, and each time you level up you will get two points with which you can distribute amongst a skill tree. You can add new abilities to your character or buff other traits, add skills to weapons etc. At one point in the game you will be tasked with choosing whether or not you want to be a Cybernetic (which focuses on cybernetic enchancements) or a Human (which focuses more on natural enhancements). Both ways are equally powerful and offer up two different ways to play the game. In addition to this there are 5 different character types to choose from : Commando, Champion, Bio-Engineer, Defender, and Berzerker. Each have a specialty (i.e the Champion is a well rounded character, the Bio-Engineer can heal himself, the Berzerker has aggro), and each class offers a whole different playing style opening up much replay value.

Long enough review yet? This is why I say that gamers, reviewers and critics did not give this game a chance, nor could they. Too Human is not the type of game you can play for one hour and write a comprehensive review on. There is just so much going on, so much to offer and many, many ways to play through the game. I'm on my second playthrough with my original character and I have yet to reach level 50 (the maximum level), and I have only found one mish mashed set of Elite armor and weapons. And I will definitely be playing through it again with the other classes.

With all the loot to collect, secret battle arenas to find, cyberwells to activate, character classes to choose from, alignments to choose from, and achievements to unlock Too Human is easily a 100 + hours of gameplay, and then some. And honestly, Too Human takes brains to play, so if you don't have em' I'd suggest staying away.

I like the merge of DC characters both villain & hero as well as the Mortal Combat characters. The violent finish moves are toned out of the game so that younger children (6 and up) are not affected by on screen character bloodshed. My only grievances are the story mode is long because you cant skip through dialogue. Also it would be cool to have a 2player story mode option on this game but obviously, being an old game I'm just ranting right now. Other than that I like the gameplay.

4.0,True,"05 31, 2013",AW2YGFNSJ22QV,B001TOMR0C,Catherine Pahno,"Love it or hate it, The Wii always had a great first party line up. Heavy hitters Like Mario and Zelda were always of the highest quality and for many, those franchises were the only reason they owned the system in the first place. But what about the third party titles? Games that were developed for the system, but not by developers that worked exclusively under Nintendo's banner. What about them? Well, to tell you the truth, most third party titles I have played on the Wii are subpar at best. But there are a few that have been developed that slipped through the cracks of mediocrity, and are pretty darn good. I'm happy to say that the game I'm reviewing today, `Red Steel 2', falls into the ""Pretty darn good"" category.

At first glance it would appear that Red Steel 2 is heavily inspired by old spaghetti westerns and a little bit of eastern influence. And in fact, it is! Well, their clich's at least. (You have the hero with no name who barely speaks, the tenacious sheriff, the damsel in distress, and the cranky, but wise mentor character) The basics of the plot are that you are the last of the `Kusagari' an elite group of guardians who were masters of both the sword and the gun. Sadly for you, the reason you are the last is because someone has  slaughtered the rest of your clansmen and it's up to you to exact revenge. But `Red Steel 2's' plot is barely paper thin and is really just an excuse to get to the game's first person sword and gunplay, which is where the games true strength lies.

It should be noted that `Red steel 2' was one of the first games developed specifically with the Wii motion plus in mind. Which, if you didn't know, is an attachment  that Nintendo released a few years back  to connect to the Wii remote, which makes its motion control more precise and accurate. (Although now a days you can just buy a Wii remote with that tech already installed) That precision does lend itself well to the combat. The control felt smooth and responsive with only the occasional misread and You can't really just waggle your way through. You have to make relatively precise and slightly aggressive swings, to put any real dent in your opponent's. But not only can you weild a blae, but an assortment of guns as well. The shooting itself feels good and the switch between the blade and guns happens on the fly, but feels completely natural. It was always super satisfying to hack away at a foe, dash away, and then finish him with a revolver round to the head.

One of the greatest thing about the combat however, is the plethora of upgrades you can earn by purchasing them with money you get by defeating enemies, smashing objects, and completing missions. These range new combat moves, guns, and even magic powers that are exclusive to your characters `Kusagari' heritage.(Two of my favorites being incendiary ammo you have for a bolt action rifle, and a power which has the hero smashing his fist into the ground, and create a shockwave that sends his foes flying.  Balancing all of the moves feels great and they did a great job with executing them. Usually just a couple of button presses and a quick fluid motion; I never felt like I was fighting or struggling with the controls.
Bottom line is that the combat is fast, fun, and the fast rate at which you earn new abilities ensures that you'll never run out of ways to make the bad guys look like chumps.

But even if the combat is exciting, everything surrounding it can get a little boring. As I said, the story is incredibly thin and the way they progress it is very bland and uninspired. To progress the game, you have to complete missions you get at safe houses (where you purchase and learn new moves) The missions are presented on a bulletin board and the objectives never deviate beyond characters telling you to `flip a switch' or something. But thankfully the missions move fast and you are always on the move, and never far from getting to fight someone again.

`Red Steel 2' may have a few yawn moments, but the combat always shined and by the end of it I flet like a true western, and I suppose in this case eastern as well, badass.

Sidenotes:  The game has a nice cell shaded art style, and some set pieces are nice to look at,(Some boss battles are pretty cool) but the game goes through a bit of loading and to try and `hide' that, expect to go through plenty of doors that take a bit for the hero to open. Most of them are quick, but it can get a little annoying to have to go through door after door.  You can also undergo side missions that are usually worth twice as much as your normal objectives, but they fall under the `find x amount of things' sort of `mission'. Unless you really want to complete them, I say just skip most of them because I found that I was more than powered enough by the end of the game to finish it through simply doing the main story.",The road to power is a great one.

Soulcalibur IV is undoubtedly the best looking release to date, but is more than a bit disappointing beyond that. Sure, it's still the same game, but the single player experience has been eviscerated. There's just a series of increasingly frustrating challenges, and a sort of survival mode, which goes on and on for 50 levels (or until you accidentally get ringed out and then hurl the controller across the room). It's tedious, and a big disappointment compared with the single player experience in previous console versions of the series.

This is offset somewhat by a ridiculously awesome character creation system, which lets roleplaying nerds like me spend hours customizing a character to achieve optimal performance, with the set of special abilities that I want. It's too complicated to describe here, but in a nutshell, there's a bajillion pieces of gear you can get in the game, and (unlike previous versions) they actually make a difference to your stats. Some add attack, some more defense, some more hit points, and some add capacity for adding special abilities to your character (such as poison attacks or resistance to grapple or ringout).

The character creation system and graphics alone are worth the price of purchase. The online experience (which is the main reason I think most people are buying it) is sort of mediocre, with you being forced to wait in line for a long time when you connect to a server, and then again any time you lose. The lag is reasonable, but still very noticeable on my high-speed line. I have trouble parrying attacks, and finesse characters are much more difficult to play when there's a delay between your controller and the character moving. It's fairly annoying to have your character feeling like its running through quicksand.

Overall, I'm sort of happy with the game.

CAMPAIGN

The campaign to this game takes right off from Halo 3. So if you bought this game JUST for the campaign I am afraid you will be a little lost and probably disappointed. For everyone that has played through the Halo campaigns, I think this was a great campaign. You start off fighting your old alien friends and work your way onto a new planet with new enemies. The story line hits close to home with Cortana thinking herself into insanity and Master Chief is doing everything he can to save her. For Halo followers this tugs at the heart strings because Cortana has always been there for you, your voice of reason and now she is struggling to keep everything together. The graphics, well what can you say, they look AMAZING. Best Halo graphics IMO by far. My only dislike is the lack of difficulty I was expecting. I have played all campaigns on legendary and this one never had that level where I was swearing at my TV and ready to throw my controller through the wall. My friend and I breezed through legendary with the exception of one level.

Graphics: 10/10
Story: 9/10 (somethings were left hanging and a little confusing. Also some plot holes)
Difficulty: 7/10
Game play: 9/10
Music: 7/10 (I liked the music but found myself not really noticing it. Where in all the other halos it was pumping you up along the way)

Overall: 9/10

MULTIPLAYER

The multiplayer finally feels like Halo again, albeit at a faster pace. My friends and I have been calling, call of Halo, for the COD aspects they integrated into Halo 4. But in the end, it works. You now unlock things a level per level basis, can create custom load outs for your spartan, and everyone has sprint now. It sounds weird for being Halo but in the end it still FEELS like Halo. I was not a big fan of Reach. Something about it never quite felt like Halo 3. But Halo 4 adapted these COD aspects very nicely and they make an added bonus to the game. So far they have not released SWAT and a couple other live modes but man, have been missing this. And really, when customizing your load out, you really have to ask one question... BR, DMR, or Carbine?

Game Play: 9/10
Load Out: 9/10
Halo Feel: 9/10
Fun: 10/10

Overall on Live: 9/10

To me these two things are all I care for when I get a Halo game. Forge is fun but I don't spend a lot of time in there and replay mode is nice but lets be honest here, not THAT many people use it. Spartan Ops was a nice twist but let be real here, Horde mode was way better.

In the end, Halo 4 is... well just that... HALO! There were no revolutionary changes to the game and you know what, I am okay with that! Halo has always been one of my favorite games, why change what isn't broken? In the end Halo 4 was a great addition to the franchise. Though 343 got rid of the Monk chant and some epic music... The game is very well done. I can honestly say it is SO nice to play all the aspects of a game and not run into game halting glitch. I think 343 industries did a fantastic job revitalizing this series and is a must buy for xbox gamers.

Over all game rating: 9/10

The world's two biggest companies on the fighting circuit pit their baddest brawlers against each other in a no-holds-barred slugfest to see just who's the best.  A lot of people have been waiting for this one to come out ever since Capcom and SNK announced late last year that they would be developing a game together, and now it's here in all its 2D glory.  So, was it worth the wait?  Does it live up to all the hype?  Well...mostly.  Overall, this is one of the most solid fighting games out there.  The control is pure Capcom gold; tight and responsive (a little awkward for SNK veterans, but after a couple of games, it fits just fine).  Four attack buttons instead of six means it even feels good on the standard DC controller.  The gameplay is a little (okay, a lot) different than your average fighting game.  You build a team of fighters using a points system.  See, each fighter in the game has a rating of 1, 2, or 3, and you get 4 points to play with, meaning you can have anywhere from two to four fighters on your team!  (The strongest characters have a rating of 3, the weakest a 1.)  Not only that, you have two different fighting styles (Grooves) to choose from; an ""SNK"" style (which plays mostly like the King of Fighters series) or a ""Capcom"" style (which plays more like the Street Fighter Alpha series).  Needless to say, strategy is this game's most important aspect, which is rare in a fighting game.  The music is pretty much what you'd expect (some techno with guitar mixed in); nothing really memorable, but decent enough.  There's a whole bunch of secret stuff to find in here too; mostly ""EX"" (alternate) versions of the original fighters, extra costume colors, and hidden stages, but enough to keep you playing for a good while to unlock them all.  And lastly, the graphics.  Since this game was developed by Capcom, all of the SNK characters were redesigned.  They have a very ""Capcom""-ish look to them; some King of Fighters fans may frown upon this, but the new looks fit the game pretty well.  The biggest disappointment, though, is the fact that with the exception of Ryu, Ken, and M. Bison, all of the Capcom characters look exactly like they did in the Street Fighter Alpha series.  When they stand across from the SNK characters, they look like they were just pasted in.  Capcom really cheaped out on that count, especially when you consider how long it took for this game to come out.  This flaw doesn't detract from the gameplay at all, though, which is the important thing.  Backgrounds are top notch, and they all have a nice little ""intro"" sequence as well, which is an SNK trademark.  Some of the stages will even interact with the ongoing fight, with toppling beams, shadows, and rustling leaves!  When you put it all together, you've definitely got one of  the standout fighting games of the year; overall great graphics, tight gameplay, a unique battle system, and even a decent replay value.

And after reviewing this game, I must admit that the graphics were quite stunning, the storyline was quite amazing, and the storyline itself does indeed follow the same single-day format like it was shown on Season 2 and Season 3 on 24. The only problem was that there were many times where the storyline doesn't follow the same exact order like Season 2 and Season 3, which sometimes gets me confuse with who's what...and what was I suppose to do.

Part of the reason for this seems to be that the game only focuses on the actions of the hero-type folk, like Jack and Tony. The show, on the other hand, switches back and forth between CTU, bad guys, the President and other connected characters, which essentially buys enough time for monotonous actions for each side of the law. For example, while a group of CTU folk are traveling to scene, the show would then cut to terrorists or whoever as they plot their evildoings. Cut back five minutes later and the CTU agents have arrived. As the game doesn't (or at least hasn't yet in just over five hours) cut solely to the bad guys, there isn't any of this ""good guy down time"" for them to cover up.

There are a couple of early examples of this in the game. In one instance, Tony and Sean, a new analyst at CTU, are cross-referencing a list of bodies found at a location and those who were supposed to be at the scene of the crime. One name doesn't match the bodies, so Tony says that they should talk to him. The camera immediately cuts to show Jack trailing someone, which lasts about 20 seconds. The next cut shows President Palmer on-screen at a live press conference, which lasts about five seconds, and then you see that Tony is watching this feed in his car as he's pulling up to talk to the suspect. In other words, it only took 25 seconds for Tony to get from the inside of CTU, into his car and then drive to his destination....which makes this game quite ""odd"" and ""unreal.""

To me, I believe that the designers are not taking to seriously of the realism of the game, but rather just wanted to speed up the pacing of the game. It does work to keep things moving, but it's a bit of a change from what you'd expect to see on the show, which is somewhat odd considering how closely other aspects of the presentation matches the program.

Despite that controversy, there are some good things about this game (obviously). The most impressive thing I found so far is how well the cut-scenes match the show's cinematography. There's a hand-held quality to them, plenty of zooms, tight focus shots and such that really match the work on the show. Some of the in-game conversations are a little more generic and videogame-like, but the preset, directed stuff I've seen so far is great. It's one of the things that makes the show seem so urgent and chaotic (which is a great thing), and the game has done well so far in matching that feel. The characters also look rather excellent and very closely resemble their real life counterparts.

But overall, to not bore you to death, this game is totally awesome, and is a must have for all 24 fans. I would definitely recommend buying this game, if not...at least renting it.

Everything or Nothing could almost be a ""lost"" 007 adventure.  After a brief prologue (in which you're thrown right into the action with precious little assistance), you're treated to a traditional Bond credit sequence, complete with a very decent little pop number by Mya.  Then, after a holographic training session, the real action begins.
The story contains several elements Bond fans will recognize.  We have that old favorite baddie, Jaws; an underwater fortress right out of Spy Who Loved Me; a villain with ties to Max Zorin (A View to a Kill) and so on.  And if you've been disappointed by the driving sequences in previous 007 games, you'll find that EA has improved upon those.  The motorcycle and helicopter scenes are excellent.
Favorite new move: As you're rappeling up or down a wall, you can make Bond turn around and fire at pursuers.  Shoot one, and he's left dangling on his own cord.
So why 4 stars instead of 5?  Well, some of the levels are just too short.  Some are too hard.  And the mulitplayer option just isn't as much fun as it has been in other games (my all-time fave is probably the one in The World Is Not Enough for N64).

Story

In a time when Humanity flourished, machines known simply as the `Children of Ymir' emerged from the depths of the Earth, bent on the destruction of all sentient beings and have waged war on the Human race for the past thousand years. This war has left the planet icy, cold and nearly inhospitable resulting in the death of all but a few million humans. These humans prayed to the Aesir and worship the ODIN (Organically Distributed Intelligence Network) and were blessed by the Gods, who sheltered the few remaining humans in an enclave known as Midgard.

Graphics

The graphics in Too Human are what you'd expect from a game that came out half way through the consoles life, they look good but aren't hyper realistic like Halo, Call of Duty or Elder Scrolls. They relate more to Dead Rising, Crackdown or Saint's Row. All in all, the graphics are standard, nothing special, nothing good or bad.

Controls

Usually controls are tough to talk about due to them usually being so generic, Too Human is different in this way. The left thumbstick moves Baldur around, but to attack, you lean the right stick in the direction you want to attack and tapping to launch enemies with melee weapons. Guns can be tough to control, especially if you're using two at a time so practice is needed with them. Rifles are capable of launching grenades which is very helpful against groups of enemies. If you can adjust to these controls, you'll have a lot of fun with the game, just give it some time.

Music/Sound/Voice

Sadly, there is little of all of them in the game, in-between fights you'll be listening to little or nothing at all. Only when in combat do you hear anything, and honestly, the music is nothing special. Sound effects seem to be repeated after a bit, but switching what you do can alleviate that issue pretty quick (don't use the same move over and over and over and over).

Other

The game can be very difficult at times, especially on higher difficulties; enemies will have various immunities at all times on tougher levels, making strategy mandatory. So mastering this game can be tough, but is very rewarding as you'll get some of the best armor and weapons.
The one thing that REALLY stands out is the ability to customize Baldur after a certain point, you can change his armor color, bonus stats and weapon effects, as well as a few other things I won't mention.

The multiplayer is pretty well done as well, I never had any issues with players joining my game and it is always fun to play hack & slash games with a friend. This can either make the game tougher or easier, depending on the skill of the players.

Achievements: A good chunk of the achievements will come naturally, some of the others will require skill (beat the 4 levels WITHOUT dying), patience (obtain 10,000 drops) and luck (complete a full set of Epic gear). With time, you should be able to get them though.

Overall

Too Human is a fun game if given a chance, best played with a friend and not for the weak of heart.

8.5/10.0

Pros
- Norse Mythology driven story (kinda)
- Ability to customize is great
- Tough game that's rewarding

Cons
- Steep learning curve
- Will give many players a headache

The graphic settings need to be configured when you first run the game as the default settings look pretty bad. I have a fast computer and video card so I run the game in 1920x1200 wide screen, which is supported by the game. Some of the textures have too much noise in them, giving a washed out look. Also many of the 3D indicators and dials don't use the full resolution, they are simply scaled up from a lower resolution. I think this is because they didn't want to play around with the field of view changes that would be required if they adjusted the scale to match the different resolutions. So the 3D look and feel is not spectacular, but it is still very good.

The game play is very well done, with options to micro-manage or automate quite a bit of it. Turning up the realism will make torpedo runs a difficult and hectic experience. This game accurately simulates programming the TDC and the difficulties in making accurate estimates. With the realism turned all the way up, evading enemy destroyer depth charge attacks is pretty well modeled, meaning it isn't easy, not not impossible either. The enemy AI is pretty good. The time compression function is really nice, allowing you to steam ahead at standard speed and still complete a trip in a short period of actual time. I've gone up as high as 2048x normal speed, it might go even higher.

With the realism dialed down, this game is a lot like the old Silent Service from Microprose in the 80's. You can look at the map and see where all the ships are, torpedo attacks are easy, and you don't worry about fuel or other logistics.

Until now, I guess.

While the region of Hoenn itself has some issues (there's a lot of water, and your path through it is kind of winding and weird), this remake manages to fix a lot of the problems that plagued the original Gameboy Advance Pok&eacute;mon titles by simply being a newer game running on a newer engine.  Incorporating a lot of the updates that Pok&eacute;mon X and Y brought to the series, Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire manage to update these GBA Pok&eacute;mon titles in a way that makes them feel truly modern again... except for missing the outfit customization.  Which thankfully makes a return in the later 3DS Pok&eacute;mon titles anyway.

The major strikes against this game aren't so much what it is, but what it isn't.  Pok&eacute;mon Emerald added a significant post-story chunk of content to the original Ruby and Sapphire game structure, and none of it is here.

There are a number of cool interactive features on each board, including special multi-ball and other situations. You really get the hang of each board combination and style.

The visuals are really quite nice, from the bumpers and flippers to the surrounding environment. The sounds go well with each world, too.

Just as good, though, are the multiplayer games. Each world offers one. There's a basketball game, a 3-tier pong game, and a game that is in essence two simple pinball maps side by side where you try to get your opponent to lose balls faster than you do. The one that shines is the foozball game, though. It looks simple enough at first - you raise and lower your bumpers to move the ball into your opponent's goal. Once you get the hang of it, though, it is amazingly fun.

Well recommended for any pinball fan!",Great fun for pinball fans,1124496000,23,,

ENDLESS OCEAN is a game that bucks that trend and instead asks you to play for no other reason than to have fun.  That alone will cause many gamers to run for the hills screaming that the game is boring, but it isn't as long as you accept the game for what it is and not wish it to be like everything else.

At the beginning of the game you can choose to be a male or female diver and you play the game diving into the ocean looking for new and exotic life as well as exploring caves and such.  There are no time limits or goals, though you can choose to do the menial tasks your ships owner asks of you there is no reward or penalty for doing so.  You are also encouraged to gather information on the different forms of life you encounter and take pictures of them.  But the main point is to explore just for the fun of it and that's what I see as the genius of this game.

With such an esoteric reason for playing there's got to be something to keep the more traditional gamer entertained and that's where the graphics come into play.  Playing this game it's very easy to get lost in the world created because everything is so life-like and beautiful.  From enormous whales and tiny schools of fish to seaweed swaying in the water, the graphics really impress.  This is a game to show off how cool games can look on Wii.  That is as long as you stay in the water.  Things get more blocky and movements are noticeably jerky whenever you board your ship to save your game, receive instruction and talk to your ship mate.

As is typical for Wii, controls are easy to learn and intuitive.  Want to swim left?  Simply point the controller to the left hand side of the screen.  What could be easier than that?  The simple controls and laid back game play make this a game that is perfect for every member of the family.

Though it won't appeal to every gamer, this is a game that anyone with a sense of adventure and love of discovery will be completely enthralled by.  Those looking for new kinds of games to play need look no further than ENDLESS OCEAN.  Despite being slow by traditional standards and its uneven graphics, it's a game that's truly fun and unique.",Endless Possibilities,1204329600,90,,

A mysterious force seems to surround the mound, as former attempts to survey the area have resulted in disapearances. Morse's excavations have drawn the interest of the press as well as aroused the ire of several conservation groups.  Matters seem about to come to a head, and on the night of the Autumn Equinox they do--but not in a way that any might have dreamed.  That night you--an unnamed character with an unspecified role--are driving down the Barrow Hill road listening to the radio when, shortly after sunset, your car stalls.  Behind you, some sort of forcefield prevents you from returning the way you came.  Your only choice is to go on, and in the process, solve the mystery of Barrow Hill.

Barrow Hill is a lovely 1st-person slideshow game in the style of the Dark Fall series (no wonder, as Jonathan Boakes and developer Matt Clark are sometime collaborators).  The action takes place in a relatively limited area, all in the course of a single night.  As your surroundings are mostly deserted, you have to rely on collecting inventory and clues to find out what has happened and heal the breach that is allowing a dark force to run ramampant in the area.  MOst of the puzzles involve accessing locked or blocked areas and putting together information.

Despite the dark subject matter and the literal darkness of the screen, I did not find this game quite as spooky as it might have been.  Some things startled me, but I never felt personally threatened.  Of course, I never encountered the large glowing stone that, by most accounts, is capable of bringing your explorations to an abrupt end.  I have heard that these encounters are the result of not having completed tasks in one area before going on to the next, so I think making a logical exploration of central areas before proceeding to peripheral ones may be a lifesaver in this game.

Sounds effect and music are understated.  Sometimes you'll hear a spooky chord that seems to herald a momentuous event, only to have nothing really happen. You hear quite a few birds, but don't see many.  Voice acting was quite good, however.  I especially enjoyed the many amusing commercials you could hear on various radio stations.

Collecting inventory was mainly easy, barring one or two pixel hunts and a few places where I had to get a hint because I wasn't quite sure what I was looking for.  Collating information was more complicated, partly because you could not keep the many documents you found during the course of the game.  This made taking voluminous notes a necessity.  Also, there were a number of red herrings:  notes that seemed to have no bearing on the case and items you could interact with that didn't have any purpose.  It was easy to get bogged down trying to do something with these items other than pick them up and put them down again. One puzzle seemed unnecessary, because by the time I solved it, I had already figured out what the clues it contained revealed.

I found the ending a little abrupt and disatisfying.  Once you solved the final puzzle, things happened very quickly.  There was not a lot of time to look around the last area you came to.  I also was left wondering about the connections between some of the elements;  I wasn't quite sure who were the good guys and who were the bad.  A cut scene at the end seemed sort of tacked on.

All in all, I enjoyed this game, which took me maybe 10 hours to complete.  It had a level of complexity in the puzzles which I have found lacking in many inventory-based games, and the plot line was engaging and well thought out.  My main critique is that I wuld have liked to have seen some of the elements developed more.  However, I look forward to more games from Matt Clark and company.",Engaging Horror Mystery,1162598400,46,,
4.0,False,"10 6, 2014",A1UKA7HUAQAMY,B00KWHOXGI,Alison Hudson,"Disney Infinity 1.0 wasn't terribly impressive to me, and at the time my son (then 9) wasn't too impressed either. He loved Skylanders, but preferred the idea of an adventure game over the kind of hybrid game/sandbox of Infinity.

Infinity 2.0 has made changes, though, and it's really a better game now. Oddly, they made the decision to go in the opposite direction that I expected -- dumbing down the adventure and ramping up the sandbox -- but I think they made the right move. It plays a bit more to the Minecraft side of the game playerbase. While my son and I are only a couple days into this set, I can already tell it will see more play at my house.

I like thier leveraging of the Marvel Universe property as well, though I am a bit sad at how the game appears to me swinging towards a more boy-oriented demographic (the old one, featuring all sorts of characters, like Frozen, had broader gender appeal). Still, the 1.0 characters work fine, so Elsa can still compete with Thor or Iron Man and kick butt!

Unfortunately, on one of those worlds they found the evil soldiers of the Shadow legion who, like most evil soldiers, want to take over the whole pie.  You play Umang, a young member of the Keeper clan who gained possession of the tetrahedon on Aura the first.  The Shadow legion is after you.  Can you avoid them, sneal into their stronghold and carry out a number of tasks to make sure they never are a threat again?

Aura 2: The Sacred Rings is a lovely first person point and click adventure featuring beautiful sound and graphics, many third person cutscenes in which you interact with other characters, and a wide variety of puzzles from inventory to sound to mechanical.  There are three main ""chapters"" to the game.  In the first, you find yourself in a desolate valley inhabited by a strage man whose ""house"" turns out to be some kind of ship.  In the second, you visit five separate worlds putting together pieces of a puzzle that will allow you to access the Shadow LEgion's stronghold (as another reviewer commented, this part reminded me very much of Riven).  In the last, you actually are in the Shadow Legion's castle, where you must figure out your path without being caught by myriad guards.

I very much liked the first two chapters of The Sacred Rings, which comprise about  3/4 of the game.  The puzzles were logical and it was easy to figure out what you were doing and why.  However, once you hit the Shadow LEgion's castle, the game really falls apart.  IN the first place, it's never quite clear why you go there or what you're supposed to be doing.  In the second, a suplot introduced in chapter 2 suddenly takes precedence over everything else.  In the third, here the puzzles become less logical.  One in particular, involving turning the pages of a number of books, I don;t see how anyone could have figured out without a walkthrough.  The castle is large and it's easy to get lost, and I found myself wandering through rooms having no idea what I was doing for long stretches of time.  Sometimes I found machines that I knew did SOMETHING but I had not idea what.  Sometimes I solved puzzles but I didn;t know why I was solving them.  Consequently, I had a very hard time going back to this part of the game and finally printed out a walkthrough just so I could finish--something I hate doing.

There are a number of different endings to The Sacred Rings.  Finding the right one is really a matter of chance, as by the time you reach the endgame you have no idea what's going on anymore.

All in all, I liked this game a lot for most of it.  But the last quarter was so complicated, illogical and badly put together that it left a bad taste in my mouth.  I give it four stars because I remember how I felt about it at the beginning, not because of how I feel now.

I completed The Sacred Rings in about 35 hours, a third of which were totally frustrating.  It ran well with no glitches.  Definitely play this game but prepare to be disappointed at the end.","Starts off well, goes downhill",1179964800,29,,

Graphics-

The graphics were done very well for the time this came out. The anime cut scenes compliment the in-game graphics. It isn't seemless but it isn't as obnoxious or distracting as it is when done in other titles. The 3D rotating map was distracting, hard to follow and made me want to throw up at points. sometimes you are exploring an area in human size. sometimes you are on a large overhead map  but you can board and exit your ""Gear"" robot. In areas where you can pilot your gear, I don't recommend exiting unless you want to be stepped on.

The Story-

The story in this game is the thing people still talk about to this day. This game addresses and sometimes spoofs Politics, Philosophy, Religion, Economics, Consumerism, Aliens, Ufo's and large stuffed animals. It was as if the programmers borrowed from every point of media that they have ever enjoyed and stuffed it into the ""story"". For large robot stuff they borrow from the Guyver, Neon Evengeleon, Gundam ( all of them ), Voltron and bunch of other cartoons I can't even remember right now. The RPG elements borrow from almost every video game ever. The main story and character arcs you will recognize from a multitude of sci fi tv shows and films. Off the top of my head, I was reminded of the Twilight Zone, Outer Limits and Soylent green. Some of the que's they borrow from anime scenes might have people ready to cry plagerism. If you don't get out much or watch too many things, then the story will probably captivate and enthrall your attention.

Game Play-

The other place this game shines is in the gameply department. The game uses an ""Active Time Battle"" system. The enemies don't wait for you to act and if you aren't careful, you get hurt in a hurry. You get these ""AP Points"" to determine the strenght or combination of attacks. Differant buttons have differant point AP point values. Entering specific button combo's will activate specific super attacks. You can save your points up to unload with a super finisher combo. Instead of magic, you get ""Ether Points"" for magic attacks. Your Ether stuff is the usual attack/buff/heal RPG fair. Fighting in your ""Gear"" is the same. Some Gears have different special attacks that use Ether that are only available to certain characters. These are weak and it's typically better to use your physical attacks instead unless you're fighting one of those magic damage only monsters. Also, you can store your points in hopes of going into Hyper-mode.

The Bottom Line-

This game has alot of things going for it. Xenogears was released in a time when Square fans had begun to feel alienated and even insulted by its later offerings. After the Final Fantasy series became dead to me, Xenogears was a refreshing breath of life. It was a very ambitious title that I don't even think the developers were able to complete. Disk 1 was a non stop rolercoaster ride. Disk 2 was a lazy, ""remember when that happened"" retrospective with a grandfather clock ticking in the background as you sit on a rocking chair and jump from one scene to the next via flash backs. Its like if young Steven Speilberg directed disk 1 and disk 2 was directed by old man George Lucas. It gets alot lazier but the programmers had a deadline to make. This is one of the greatist games I will never play again. I enjoyed it. It was resonably deep but Xenogears is a pilgrimadge I will only be making once.

Trying to get away from all the Japanese inspired titles out there which just become a little aggravating to me after a while I picked this one up.

I am currently at a level 12 character and every time I pick this up to play I can't seem to put it down until my battery is dying.

Character customization seems a little skimpy (you have your garden variety melee and spellcasters) but the skill tree adds variety if not a little more individuality as you level up. No, you can't customize with 20 different skin colors or body types, but as you change equipment you can't see all that anyhow. So far there seems to be a lot of equipment and accessory options as well as a weapon upgrade system where you can attach different stones and whatnot for added effects. The weight limit of each character adds to the challenge of carrying only what you need and maybe a few extras to sell or whatever. It doesn't feel like a hindrance as this is a typical factor in most of these types of games.

The graphics are nice. Monsters, while a little uninspired, are rendered well and each has a very unique movement style that sometimes looks very cool. Each new area seems to have a fair share of new monsters so it breaks up any monotony and keeps it interesting. Environments are, while still nice looking, nothing that's gonna blow your hair back. Caves, mines, forests, medieval-esque towns, sewers, etc... again, as most people have said, if you ever played Baldurs Gate or Diablo or NWN this game closely mirrors the aesthetics and mechanics.

The sound is ambient with effect noises being mostly what you'll notice. It gets the job done. Little things like fire crackling, footsteps over gravel and screams of monsters are enough to put you into the environment.

There is a storyline, but I doubt you'll be thinking about it much while you're knee-deep in werewolf guts.

Gameplay is not strategic in the least. You encounter monsters, you kill them, you move on to more monsters to kill. It's a button masher most of time with a few slots for special abilities. You might try sneaking around corners but it won't do you much good because you can't see far enough away on the screen anyhow. I am a little shocked I'm not bored at this point but Untold Legends has some kind of thing about it that makes it a lot of fun.

And it's a stunning achievement.  In the cutscene after the first part of the game, the level of detail on the characters are incredible; for the first time since I started gaming, I could have mistaken the skin for a REAL person.  And this is just the release window games!  I can only imagine how much developers will draw out of the PS4 in the coming years and it's exciting.

Now, I had only played about an hour of Assassin's Creed III prior to playing this game, so no, this reviewer is not enough of an AC expert to explain any nuiances between the titles.  I'm sure there are other reviews that can satisfy this.

There is a crapton of things to do in this game; I got to Havana and was overwhelmed to be honest.  Do the side quests?  Look for all the shanties?  Get all the observation points?  Continue with the main story?  Let's put it this way:  If you're an AC fan, hated III and are worried, DON'T.  You will be in heaven with this game.

Around the 4-5 hour mark (if you go through the main story only) you'll unlock your ship.  This is where the game really opens up.  Now when you put naval warfare (very well done, BTW), and combine that with searching on foot, you have a game that really sets sail.

However, as other reviewers have mentioned, the controls are really bad in spots.  Too often I'd want to jump off a building and it wouldn't respond.  Or I'd be sprinting, barely bump a building and now I'm climing instead of running.  You would really think Ubisoft could get this right after so many years of making games but it's still a sore spot.

Still, understand what you're getting.  It is a massive graphical and U/I improvement in the PS4 version.  The game runs at 1080p and is stunning.  There's a ton to do.  There's no slow down or lag whatsoever, at least what I noticed.

This car racing game is more based towards 3d views and some somewhat unreal acceleration functions. But mind you this increases the fun-factor by several 100%.

Can you imagine a racing game where the racing track actually runs trough mountains and valleys in dimensions of several x0 meters up and down ? Its like making your car work and jump like a goat in the Alps ;-)

Ever thought of turning on the rocket boost engine when you are in the air ?

This game has those features and anything you haven't thought of yet !!

The background weather is changing from rain to snow to sunshine and even the waterdrops appear and disappear on your wind screen.

That is the car racing game with the most stunning fun and stunt-effects. So for sure you can make stunt starting from simple drifting, to airspins, activate superpower to break through jungle deep woods, activate hyper accelaration where the racing track gets transformed in front of your eyes into a ramp .. and it just doesnt stop there.

First time I played it I was shocked that you actually have to start running through a training before you are allowed to play it. Once the real game starts you understand why the training was made for it. ;-)

As a PC gamer myself, a gaming mouse can make or break how you play. If you don't have the right gadget for the job, you will stink in game. For instance, I play World of Warcraft. A gaming mouse with buttons can make all the difference in the world when I'm either in dungeons OR raiding. Those extra buttons make it easier on a gamer to click while playing, so you don't have to end up clicking a TON of keys on a keyboard. If you play WoW, you'll already know this though.

However, this game can exist because it's really good.  I love the fact that the action is pretty much nonstop.  The object of the game is to KEEP MOVING.  I like that.  Too many games feel like they're moving at a snails pace the way you're required to complete objectives and this results in a lot of ""stopping and moving"".  Gears of War is truly an action game, and a very good one at that.

The graphics are excellent, to put it simply.  If you hate the graphics well, you must not be seeing the same game as me!

The controls are pretty good for the most part, however, every so often I will accidentally do something that I didn't mean to do.  This can be a problem when enemies are on the screen ready to attack you.

-The button layout is awkward.  They are not in a straight line across and the upward curvature they both have make it difficult to know exactly where each button is. In addition, the bottom row is set too far to the left.  It's just one inch but when playing a game such as SFIV, knowing exactly where the buttons lay is essential.  By themselves it's no big deal but when combined it can become frustrating in the heat of battle.

-The microphone input is also in an absurd location, as the cord can interfere with joystick movement.  This can be remedied by wrapping the cord underneath the base, but it should not have to be and there's no reason the input couldn't be located at the bottom.

-The start and select buttons are too close to the main ones.

Aside from those two things, everything's golden.  The buttons feel solid, the stick is tight, and the weight is perfect.

The emphasis of these games has always been on stealth, with some action thrown in. Series star Sam Fisher, a veteran of war and many battles, is the equivalent of a one man army. He can get in, get out, and leave a trail of bodies behind him. In this game, Sam is no longer restrained by government orders, so you as a player have a lot of freedom as to how to approach a mission. Guns blazing or no one sees you, it's your choice. Of course, you can always do a little of both.

The game had a lot of documented problems getting released. Trying for another direction, the game changed a few times during development and it shows. It seems as times as if there was some copy and paste elements to it's final construction, with a narrative that goes many places and is not as consistent as it could have been, even if the story is a bit more simple to follow than in previous games.

Even though the campaign is a bit short (5-8 hrs) but really feels like a complete story with some great moments.

If it ain't broke don't fix it....GoW 2 is out and so far I am very very excited.
The game starts off with about as much bang as a sci fi action movie should and takes you thru the paces. It picks up where the first one leaves off and has a bit more of a fleshed out storyline. And if you have been paying attention with some of the reviews, the story actually does make you feel more of a dire urgency to play this thru and save Sera

The new characters are cool and I got a bit attached to one and when it was their time it was a ""Awww dang ..."" kind of moment...on the other hand there was the return of a few characters that really made me feel that this game was done some justice.

Quite frankly, there wasn't too too much added into the game, but there are few standouts.

- If you thought the 1st one looked good, then this one surpasses that one....some spots do experience a bit of a drop in framerate but you will be so busy killing the Hordes, you may not have time to notice.

- A few new weapons are in the game, I won't spoil it too much or say beyond what you may already know...but I will say that the mortar attack is really of the chainz.

- The Brumak....nuff said

- The cover system is not as bad as the first one but sometimes can be a bit funky in some spots

_ Newer vehicle modes gives this game more variety also

A few lowlights

- right now, MP playing is still a bit laggy and glitchy...hopefully this will be patched pretty soon

- Dialogue is still cheesy at best

One thing I did enjoy about the multiplayer is for one....there are 5 downloadable maps right off the bat. The practice mode is cool too....you can even set up a room with yourself and some bots so you can try to suck much less against the pros. The new modea rae a blast such as Annex almost a throwback to BF 1942 and then there is Horde mode....when it works...

But between this and Call of Duty 5....you will have your hands full

This is almost identical to the ""Leisure Suit Larry: Magnum Cum Laude"" game, except that this is more like an NC-17 version, with T&A bared for geeks like us to enjoy late at night.

Our hero Larry is Larry Lovage, nephew of the famous loser from the late 80's, Larry Laffer.  The original creator of the LSL series, Al Lowe, was unfortunately not involved in the development of this game at all, so what we have is not the old, very enjoyable adventure game, but more like a puzzle game with silly mini-games that you win in order to see things.

Apparently some people felt hugely let down by this change.  I would have preferred the old LSL style myself, but find this game quite tolerable, actually, make that enjoyable.  The 3D girls are gorgeous, and the humor not bad at all, and the mini-games are pretty fun to play and easy to beat.  The gameplay is pretty much linear but, because the games are not impossible like true puzzle games like Myst, or even the old LSL series which involved a lot of running around, backtracking and digging and searching, the entire experience is on the lighter side.  This game won't win any award, but it's easy to play so in the end is still an enjoyable game, esp. for geeks like us late at night.

Oh, I see that Amazon has raised the price on the game since I bought it.  If you can find it for under 30 bucks, and you enjoy computer-generated 3D T&A, you should give this a try.

I recommend not to play this game endlessly, it takes a long time (real) to build a decent and thriving city.  When I first started building cities, I would get impeached after about 20 years.  This game, like other simulation games, takes experience before you become successful.
I especially liked the options of choosing real city terrains, such as Paris or Berlin.  This is a great feature if you would like to see how Paris would look if you built it. What if Paris had the Taj Mahal instead of the Eiffle Tower?
You can also have aliens attack the city, which is neat to watch. I recommend turning off the disasters when you first get your city running.  Limited budget and income makes repairing buildings and roads very hard.  I have found that after running a city for about 60 years(Sim time) there is enough surplus in the budget to experiment with the disasters.
It is a little hard to have the same poplutaion as the surrounding SimCities.  My cities have always had a fraction of the population in comparison to my SimCity neighbors.
And it seems that you can't keep the Sims happy.  If you have taxes too high they complain, so you have to lower them.  Eventually, I had to lower them down to about 1%...and they still complained that they are being taxed to high.  So you have to lower it to 0%, however you no longer have the population as a source of income.  This aspect of the game is a little annoying.  If you play this game sparadically, which I recommend, it is not as annoying as if you decide to play it of several hours many days in a row.
As far as building farms and seaports... I had a hard time having these features develop in my cities.  But after much determination and a quick glance at the official website, I have been successful.  The only problem I have with the farms is keeping them when my city started to expand.  What I mean is after awhile, farms started to turn into factories.  Once this happens there is no turning back to farmland.
Here's a tip:  try to keep the zones you intend to have farms develop as far away from the residential, commerical and industrial centers as possible.
Another zoning problem that I have encountered is with the airport zoning.  I can get it to develop, but not to how I want it to look.  This type of zoning is expensive, so demolising existing buildings that spring up randomly and re-zoning/dezoning becomes a nuisance.
Overall this is a decent game, and a good value.  I am looking forward to the next SimCity, and hope that they improved on what is already a good game.
This is a game where there is not much action, usually simulation type games are slow paced, and this is one of them.  It took me many weeks of periodical playing to build a halfway decent city.  Although, when I first got the game, I played many hours on end thinking I was going to master this game in a day.  No such luck.
If you are looking for quick results and action, this is not the game for you.  But if you like taking your time and experimenting, I definitely recommend this game.",Build Your Own Metropolis,1042329600,21,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

This particular review will be for two groups. Those that have been paying Blizzard at least $15 a month for several years and want to break free of that monkey on your back, and those who are thinking about playing Warcraft for the first time.

For those of you who are looking to stop funneling money to Blizzard while they continue to dumb the game down, ignore their customer's wants and needs, and slowly make Warcraft a kid friendly game in an effort to bury Warcraft like Netflix did themselves:

Guild Wars 2 loaded great. I did free up some space on my IMac to load it into Windows because apparently there is no version for Mac yet. I won't lie, I am trying to wean myself off of WOW and force myself to like GW2. It's not that hard to do. GW2 has some great points. The battlegrounds are fun and you get into them instantly. Learning what you are doing in one is not nearly as intuitive as WOW but it's not hard to enjoy them. The questing is not very difficult yet, and my highest character is only a level 10. She has died a few times, but not really from challenge as much as laziness :) If you run into a mob, you're going to die. The rez points are all over the map so you do some running but not like in Vanilla WOW. One of the best features, which Blizzard could (but won't) learn from is the instant travel. There are no flight paths, no long waits (longest is something like 15 real time minutes while your char flies from Feathermoon Stronghold to Tanaris) to get to a spot in the game. Just click your map and click where you want to go.  The 'auction house' can be accessed any time, anywhere just by clicking on a tab. The weird thing is that you have to find a certain character at larger towns to claim your money from these auctions. This seems very inconsistent as far as game planning, which brings me to the game itself. I've already said, I'm a WOW person. So yes, I'm going to compare. I fell into Wow headfirst and loved it. It was so pretty and so intuitive. I tried Allods and it's a lot like GW2 in that it's not intuitive. You will have questions and have no one to ask. But it's nearly as pretty as Warcraft. I tried Rift. I really liked Rift and if it wasn't at least partly about paying $15 a month, I'd stick with Rift. They have instant travel from stations placed throughout the game. The downside is it's dark and kind of medieval looking, the mounts/running is kind of dorky looking. Little things like that. The 'rifts' themselves were a super fun perk. So far, and I'm only at 10, GW2 is kind of dark like Rift is.

GW2 is fun. It's more than worth giving a try. The very, very best part of GW2 is that you buy the game once, and (so far) you never pay again. There is no monthly fee. Unless this game really changes a whole lot after level 10, I'd say I personally would never pay a monthly fee to play GW2. But, with zero fees after you buy this initial game, I'd rate it above World of Warcraft unless money is not a problem for you.

For those of you who have never played Warcraft, my advice is DON'T. While it may sound like a ringing endorsement for WOW, I do NOT mean it to when I say....World of Warcraft is wayyyyyy to fun and addictive. Everyone in my household played, started staying up late to play, joined guilds, played with others around the globe, lost sleep, called in sick...etc etc. At one point we had three accounts, at $15 a month each. Don't laugh, you probably pay that much a month for your fancy phone or McDonalds...we played Wow. Together! Great times!!! But then they nerf your character that you worked so hard to get to be the strongest you could, got her/him the best gear in game, only to have that be crap next to the newest armor. Then they come out with a new boxed version you have to install or you can't level your character up beyond a certain point. Bang, There's an additional $40+ bucks for each account.

Get GW2. Try it out. You may fall in love with it a lot faster because you avoided Warcraft. Save yourself a LOT of money and aggravation and addiction. Skip the monthly fee games. If GW2 can do it, others can too.

GW2 is fun. It's a huge game, with a huge world to explore freely. It has crafting skills and battlegrounds where you can play with other folks, guilds, questing, etc etc. Thinking of getting GW2 for a friend? Be sure their PC can handle it. Want to play GW2 with your kids or spouse etc? Grab 2 boxes. For less than a hundred bucks you and your spouse/kid/friend can immerse yourself in a new world. If it was prettier, more intuitive, I'd give it five stars.

So does that mean that this game is a total disaster? A total mess? No, but I will show below how that saying applies.

WHAT WENT WRONG:
For me, the biggest problem with Dead Space is the story. While the gameplay is mostly rock-solid, the plot is full of uninteresting characters and ridiculous mission assignments.

For one, your main character doesn't even speak the whole 12-14 hours of gameplay. It's pretty sad when even the monsters you are fighting are more vocal than you are.

Then there's Nicole. Supposedly my goal is to find her and save her blah blah blah. But with such poor character development I really didn't care if she lived or not--or any of the other NPC's for that matter.

When it comes down to it, almost all games have you do some sort of fetch quest. Go and fetch the golden flute, find the key, get the power module, etc. Role-Playing Games (RPGs) are abundant in fetch quests, but, when done well, go unnoticed because you are also interacting with other colorful characters and getting wrapped up in the story.

We've already established that the character development is lacking, which makes the fact that every single mission is the equivalent of ""Fido, Fetch!"" all too apparent.

You're on this huge spaceship and every possible subsystem that can be broken, is. The asteroid-defense lasers, the oxygen content, multiple doors and control stations, the shuttle and so on. You have a few comrades-in-arms that keep in touch with you via a spiffy Heads Up Display (HUD), but often (if not all) the time they are staying put in their safe little control room while you're doing all the dirty work.

For once I would have liked to see some different mission assignments, like ""Hold this position for X amount of time until help arrives."" or be the guy in the control room for once helping someone else get through the ship by opening the right doors at the right time.

As for bugs/glitches, I found two: The first one I was in a moving elevator and backed up against the wall and somehow fell THROUGH the elevator floor all the way down to the bottom of the shaft and couldn't get out.
The second glitch I found was on the last chapter where the entire side of one building had become transparent, exposing the outside of the level.
While the first bug hampered gameplay and required loading a prior save, the second did not.

WHAT WENT RIGHT:

For all that went wrong, there is a LOT that went right with DEAD SPACE. If you were to ask me how to sum up the game in 4 words it would be this:

DOOM 3 Done Right

The gameplay (except for those two bugs mentioned above) is pretty solid. Saved games are reliable (unlike FARCRY 2), weapons function as advertised, inventory screens are clean (although text can be small on non-HDTV's) and the controls are pretty good.

There is a nice variety in enemies to kill: from fast to slow, from small to behemoth, from short-range attackers to stationary long-range attackers. And all of them have the ability to make you sit on the edge of your seat if you turn the corner at the wrong moment or forget to have your weapon drawn when exiting the elevators.

The weapon selection is nice, although I personally only used the Plasma Cutter/ Line Cutter/ Pulse Rifle/ Force Cannon combo for the whole game. I recommend 2-3 fast-firing weapons and 1 or 2 weapons with super-powerful secondary fire modes (Line Cutter/ Force Cannon).
What's even nicer is the fact that you can upgrade your weapons to make them deal more damage, hold more ammo, increase speed, or reduce reloading times.

Best of all is the realism. For once Outer Space is actually SILENT. Another realistic touch is how this mining ship has mining tools as weapons. The only real weapons I can recall with non-mining applications are the flamethrower and the pulse rifle.
The walls are smeared with blood and alien markings. There are also ads and portraits of past commanders of this once-great spaceship.

Is the game scary? Not as scary as F.E.A.R., in my opinion, but you'll definitely jump a few times (mostly towards the beginning of the game when you don't know what to expect). This game does create a very believable spaceship-in-outer-space atmosphere.

I don't usually play the Survival-Horror genre so hopefully that puts some perspective on how good this game is.

Pros: Excellent graphics on highest settings and good card.  Above average story and ""chill"" factor will keep you coming back for more. Using Razor 5.1 headphones really enchances the creepiness via sound. Challenging at times but not impossible.

The first test was not on my Xbox One, however. I used it with my PC tackling raid night playing World of Warcraft. I was in heaven. The game environment sound came in rich and deep. The voices transmitted over Mumble came in clearly. My team could hear me without any problems. The only thing I had to adjust was the audio levels so the game sounds were not competing against the voices.

The second test was playing Halo 5 on the Xbox One. Again, the Afterglow headphone pulled through with flying colors. Rich, deep sounds. My team mate could hear me and I could hear them. This has become the preferred way to play now instead of using the room speakers.

For audio/mic performance: Solid five stars

Comfort level wise, I have more of a mixed review. The padded ear cups and the headband is very comfortable. It covers the ear rather then sit on top. (This adds to the rich audio environment.) The headband is adjustable. It will take some fidgeting and readjustments before you get it to feel just right on your head. However, as with most headphones I've used in the past, wearing glasses will always add a level of discomfort as the ear pads press your ear against the temple frames. Also, your ears will get very warm after being covered for a while. While the headphone are comfortable, they get only 4 out of 5 stars for overall long term comfort.

JAGELLA,"After playing the first two missions of No One Lives Forever 2 (NOLF2), I thought I'd found what I previously thought did not exist: namely, a flawless game.  Everything seemed perfect, but alas, nothing is perfect in this world especially when it comes to computer games.
Don't get me wrong; I find a lot to like in this game, not the least of which are the graphics.  My PC features a 128 MB Radeon 9800 Pro graphics card, so I was able to turn up the graphics options.  I believe NOLF2 may have the best looking rendering of people of any game I've played, and the AI is above average too.  There's a lot of detail in the visuals in this game, and almost everything looks clear which is a real plus considering that many of the newer games often look indistinct especially when they try to render tree leaves.
Getting back to the first level or two--not only did the levels look good, but the gameplay, AI, and everything else worked really well.  You can even ride a snowmobile which I did even when it wasn't necessary.  These levels showed off the graphics of NOLF2 (see above), and I was impressed with a waterfall on the first level and explosions on the next level or two.
But it didn't take much longer to see some flaws in this game.  Since it's a spy game, you naturally need to do a lot of snooping.  What I didn't like about the searching is that you need to point your cross hair all over the place to find text that tells you that you need to press the use key to do something like activate a switch.  It's very easy to miss these text prompts, and I spent a lot of time wandering a level or even going back and forth between levels only to realize that I'd missed a prompt when I was very near it a half-hour earlier!  Very frustrating.
Another problem with the game is the stealth missions.  Most of the time NOLF2 is rather forgiving in that you can blast your way through trouble if you are spotted, but on at least one level you must either go back to the beginning of the level if you are seen or load your last save.  It must have taken me the better part of an hour and numerous reloads until I finally found the room I needed to search for without getting caught.  Nevertheless, the stealth missions in this game are better than what you find in most games, and you learn tricks to get through them.  Just be prepared to get frustrated until you learn the best stealth techniques.
Although No One Lives Forever 2 is a good game, it's not the flawless game I thought it might be.  Those first two missions were a tease, I suppose.  So if anybody finds a perfect game, preferably a shooter, then please let me know!

There have been all types of SW games so it would be hard to point out why they all fail but if there is a common denominator, a ""crappiness x-factor"" if you will its this: The games don't live up to fan expectations because they don't deliver the one thing the fans cant live without... Suspension of disbelief.

The whole reason why the SW franchise is so successful is that it takes you away to another world. You WANT to become Han Solo. You WANT to be Luke or Leia. Like Ian Mcdiarmid once said about the Emperor's powers: ""I wish I had some of that in my right pinkie."" People expect these games to take them to that glaxy far away and they tend fall short. However, from the looks of this game, maybe this console generation is the one that will finally deliver the gaming experience we were looking for.

Playing the demo for this game I was immediatly hooked and knew I was going to buy it. Everything I ever wanted to do with the Force is there. Moving stuff with my mind? Check. Throw enemies across rooms? Check. Handle a Light Saber with flawless skill? Check. Unleash some fury with Sith Lightning? Check. (come on, we all wanted to do that even if it was a dark side power) However I was a little worried that the gameplay would turn repetitive and I would quit halfway from boredom. But I have been pleasntly surprised.

The game looks great. Felucia, Raxus Prime, Cloud City, and several Starships in space all provide the required SW feel. In that sense the game is totally faithful to the SW tradition in that during the course of the story you see very different kinds of worlds and enviroments. The graphics look awsome despite some glitches here and there and the charachters are spot on. The story is classic SW and has a little bit of romance, humor and of course lots of adventure. Seeing some classic chracters like Princess Leia and Bail Organa give the story depth. Also, the story motivates you to continue foward. You want to finish the game because you want to know how its gonna end. The voice acting is very good.

Being able to play as such a powerful charcter is very cool. The game tries to keep it interesting for the gamer by adding new powers and abilities as you progress. working them into your strategy is part of the fun.

Now for the not so good...

Having to buy those upgrades, combos and talents can be a little tedious. Mostly because of load times. Lucasarts should find a way to make this part flow better. Its not extremely annoying but it does bother you bit. Also, I think it is entirely possible to finish this game with a healthy does of button-mashing which means that the whole upgrade system is not really necesary. I found it challenging to work new things into my strategy which in turn made the game more interesting. Those who chose to mash their way through the game might get bored or frustrated but it is possible I think.

The camera needs work. I found myself fighting some tough enemies with the camera in the wrong spot and ending up not seeing where that enemy was. In cases like that I found the camera too slow in what are very fast-paced fights. If I was, for example trying some hit-and-run moves to beat a rancor, I would often end up not seeing him on screen. By the time I moved the camera, he had already thrown something my way or worse. Not cool. The targeting system needs work as well. We should be able to switch between enemies(hard to do given you use all the buttons already but something to think about)not just let the game choose for you.

Despite those flaws, I found the game very entertaining. For the very first time I felt like a Jedi(or a Sith for that matter) playing a SW game. Maybe my expectations were so low that an average game has captivated me but I don't think so. SW fans should enjoy this game and be excited at the prospect of improved versions of this theme coming in the future.",More fun than I thought it would be,1224460800,3,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",

In those days, you weren't cool unless you played a Super Mario Bros. game or two. Super Mario Bros. 3 was one such games, and it was no doubt one of the most popular games in Nintendo's 100-odd-years history.

Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3 is almost an exact replica of that game. Porting the game over to the GBA, Nintendo has made some minor changes to the it, but the large part of it remains essentially the same old of old. Which makes it a rather nostalgic run down the memory lane for gamers from the 80s' era, who are still gaming. Like me.

For the uninformed, the mission of Mario and Co. is simple. You will need to save a Princess (duh!), and to do that, you will need to battle through different levels in nine worlds. Going through all the worlds painstakingly is not compulsory though, if you happen to be strategic with some items you collect along the way, but the more accomplished Mario fans will tell you there's more fun in doing it ""the right way"".

Of course, doing it that way means a very long, and sometimes tough journey. You get upgrades when the game progresses, allowing you to change into various costumes. One of these is a raccoon suit that allows you to sweep your enemies with your tail, and to fly up to the sky. Pretty nifty, if you ask me. Other costumes lets you split fire, swim faster in water and throw hammers, etc. All of these give you some advantage in certain situations, but knowing when, and how to use them effectively is a different story.

Graphics wise, the colors look every bit as vibrant as they were, but the pictures are a little short when compared to modern standards. This has always been a problem with porting classic games onto the GBA. Still, I'm not a fussy person. Graphics have never been an issue for me when it comes to games, or I'd have bought an XBox.

The audios in this game are ok, although the music sounds like it has been remixed. Some of the in-game comments are a little corny, for example, when Mario gets a costume upgrade, he yells out: ""That's what I needed!"". This gets old after, like, two minutes. The special effect audios are as good as ever, so you get the classic ""ting"" sound when you latch onto coins, and the robotic tunnel-climbing sound when you get into one of those secret tubes, which is cool.

The changes in this version of Super Mario Bros. 3 now allow you to save your change. A welcomed move, surely, but the game is so easy, you probably won't need the feature if you intend to go through it speedily with the magic whistles. Oh, did I say magic whistles? Ok, I shall shut up. Other additions include five advance medallions per level, and a chance to take on the classic Mario Bros. game. If you're just buying this game for Super Mario Bros/ 3, you may conveniently ignore all these.

In conclusion, Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3 is a classic revisited. It's an adventure with the qualities to impress fans, whether young or old, and will no doubt add hours of fun for you on the GBA. This is a game truly worthy of the Super Mario Bros. franchise.",Do not underestimate the powers of a fat plumber.,1107820800,2,,

4.0,False,"07 15, 2015",A2K7OP4VPIHQU9,B00RHI62N2,Chalgyr&#039;s Game Room,"Crossovers are the fuel for many imaginations as people consider what their favorite characters or teams might be like when pitted against or given the opportunity to work with other popular entities. J-Stars Victory VS+ takes this notion to almost absurd levels with loads of characters that normally would have no opportunity to interact, but here get to create unusual teams and create epic and often unexpected match-ups.

The opportunity to throw this many crazy characters together is almost too good to pass up. The story is fairly ridiculous - but it kind of has to be given the incredibly disparate nature of many of the characters and worlds at play here. The roster itself is an impressive collection of Shonen Jump manga and animation characters is in many ways  representative of the game itself: large, flashy, fun, but also shallow and a little rough around the edges.

J-Stars Victory VS+ is a fighting game, but instead of a one-on-one fighter such as Mortal Kombat or Tekken, you are getting an arena fighter with wide open landscapes and plenty of destructible environments. Battling in 3D environments can be a tricky affair. As much as I personally enjoyed Dragon Ball Xenoverse and its unique take on the storyline, zipping around hoping to be within range of an opponent could sometimes prove frustrating, and that same element of frustration does exist here.

Battles play out with teams starting on different ends of a map. They close the gap quickly - usually using some sort of ranged attack when close enough or a dash button - and then engage in a fairly shallow system of combat. Early on, the combat is actually pretty fun. The barrier to entry is low, giving players ample opportunity to shine with flashy attacks. The battles are not always symmetrical in nature - teams can be comprised of as many as three or as few as one warrior. You can also summon in a backup character to deal some quick damage every so often.

There is a meter that regulates how your team is doing. It tends to swing one way or the other, depending on the action, and when it reaches one side, that team can do a super attack that boosts them as a whole. This can lead to some pretty flashy cutscenes and some over-the-top attacks that really break things open. The win conditions usually involve beating characters on the other team a specific number of times (again between one to three times). So if your team of three is fighting another team of three, killing one of their people does not knock them out of the fight completely. That beaten character respawns shortly afterwards, but you now have one knockout to your credit. Reaching the requisite number of knockouts then ends the fight.

The system itself is not bad, but it the move list is pretty shallow. Also, while there is a huge cast of characters (most of which are locked at the beginning and need to be unlocked by spending the coins you earn on them), many of the characters tend to play in very similar fashion. It is still quite entertaining to get your team into a super powered state while they pull off their ultimate moves and decimate nearby opponents and buildings with abandon, but after a handful of hours you pretty much know what to expect from the combat side of the house.

Thankfully there are enough options to keep gamers busy for a good long time, especially if you enjoy the somewhat unusual combat. The story mode is probably the most entertaining, allowing you to pick from one of four starting groups. The story itself is nonsensical stuff, running characters around from one location to the other while trying to blur the lines between these different properties. The voice acting is all in Japanese, for those who care about that sort of thing. Still, the written localization is pretty good and there is a lot of wacky narrative as you accept quests, sail around the world and find fights with rival groups in this mode.

There are other modes as well, such as online and free battle, but the story mode is still the most entertaining. Characters look very different in combat, and some of their moves may make them handle in unique fashion, but without the story to tie it all together, the other modes are basically just random melees with characters simply thrown in for good measure. Still, none of them have the same sense of progression found in the story mode, which has items to be found, areas to be unlocked and levels to be earned by the characters you use.

It's great to have popular characters such as Naruto and Goku as well as more obscure ones like Luck Man available in one title like this, and fans of the different mangas will no doubt find something fun to be had here. Because the game is accessible with a large cast of characters and plenty of things to unlock, J-Stars Victory VS+ is easy to get into and gives you lots of reason to come back. I do wish that the primary part of the game however, the combat, was a deeper experience with greater variety, but it does not sour an otherwise entertaining game.",So. Many.

Both took a franchise that was very popular and turned it into a real-time strategy that was very simplistic but surprisingly fun, thus making it a gateway game for people who had never tried a strategy game before.

Like BFME, Halo Wars offers the bare minimum of customization: bases are in fixed locations on the map, there are three basic types of units, and only one kind of resource. Without all the fixin's that us RTS vets are used to, though, this game is very intuitive, and even players who have never touched a strategy game in their life will have the hang of it within the first few missions of the campaign (which is excellent, by the way, but only playable on the UNSC side - you only play the Covenant in skirmish mode). The graphics in the game are also superb, comparable to BFME II played on the good graphics settings.

The game has the standard 1000G available from Achievements, but spreads them out a lot. Each mission has a 5G Achievement attached to it. Sort of making up for that, you get five Achievements worth 250G (and a pair of gamer pictures) just from beating the campaign on any difficulty, two of them worth a whopping 70G apiece. Another 80G (and maybe more gamer pictures - haven't tried to get them yet) await those who beat the game on Hard (30G) and Legendary (50G) as well.

A few things about the game did tick me off. Grouping units is nonexistent, and specialized selection is nearly absent - you can select individual units, a series of individual units, all units of one type, all in a general area, all on-screen, or all overall. This made planning multi-front assaults hard to execute (the ""all in a general area"" selection option did not always grab every unit in an area, and sometimes grabbed a separate unit that was near a clustered group that it could probably have been on-screen if the screen was aligned just so). There is a nice ""Automatic"" difficulty option in Skirmish mode, but it gets very hard very quickly (I went from a breezy 40 to a decent 60 to a hair-pulling 97 in three matches). Finally, when you play as the Covenant (or against them), you really have to look at your buildings to tell them apart. I still click on the building to see what it is. Thankfully, all the UNSC buildings look different enough that you can see what they are at a glance.

Halo Wars is a good entry-level RTS, made even more impressive by the fact that it's on a console. Don't play this game looking for strategic depth, but it's a blast to play or watch being played.",A surprisingly good Halo RTS,1261526400,,,

They decide to release one last game, calling it ""Final Fantasy,"" thus being their final game if it doesn't sell good and appeal to fans. But, this definitiely wasn't the case, and thank goodness it wasn't.
""Final Fantasy"" was the start of the most well-known RPG series in the world. It sold really well and was successful enough to span many sequels, spinoffs, and whatnot. Released in 1987 in Japan, it wasn't released in the U.S. until 1990. Fans all over the world loved it.
Well, first off, Final Fantasy is a very challenging game (at least the first time you play through it). You have to choose the classes for your characters at the beginning (Fighter, Thief, White Mage, Black Mage, Red Mage, and Black Belt). These will be the classes you keep throughout the entire game, with the exception of a small upgrade about 3/4th's or so through it. Your characters never talk, so there isn't much character development. What is there, though, is a game that was just simple and downright fun to play. There was no game that could be mistaken for a movie like the newer FF's (although I like every FF in a way). Just a simplistic game. Go to a town, talk to the townspeople, buy equipment, find out your destination, and repeat. At the same time, you will go into random battles. You must constantly watch your HP and make sure not to use up too much of your magic or your items.
This is one of the most challenging FF's out there, but challenge is good. The story goes beyond the ""save the world"" theme, and was one of the first games to have a more complex story than your average RPG back then. It's really tough to find nowadays, so I would recommend going with ""Final Fantasy Origins"" for the PS One.

I thoroughly enjoyed this title, after having played Tiger 07.  The mechanic is diferent than either Wii sports or Tiger, but not all that dificult.  I sponsor a Wii night at a local bar, and nobody who stepped up the console had many problems playing the game after a couple of holes.  The putting is much more sound than Tiger, which was a deal breaker for me in Tiger 07.  The opponents play well, which I like, because after three or four events in Tiger Woods you're smoking the ball 350 yards and beating Tiger himself handily.

Yeah, in the beginning I didn't like the PC UI or the keyboard controls. I could have switched to the controller if I wanted to, but I decided to stick with keyboard just because. I've been playing for over a week now and to be honest, it gets easier to handle the more you play. You get used to the controls and the game moves along just fine. Yeah, they took a different approach with the mechanics of the game. It plays more like Skyrim, with better characters and more realistic limitations on whether or not your mount can scale a mountain (spoiler: it can't).

I'm finding I'm less reliant on tactics in battles. I don't mind that. If I needed to rely on tactics, I would, but I seem to get through battles without needing to be super thoughtful about who is doing what move from what position every second of the fight. In that regard, I'm reminded of Mass Effect-- you can plow forward and, for the most part, your party will handle itself if you let it, and you can stop and reorganize people if things do get out of hand. However, I will say that the reason I decide not to rely on tactics, is because the tactical camera and controls are a pain in the ass (again, on KB&M here) and I don't feel like wasting my time-- I just want to play.

The rest of the game is great. The graphics are smooth, the environments are beautiful, the characters are fantastically written and voiced, and there's an absolute minimum map repetition, which happened a lot in the first two games and got old fast. So far every place I've been to has been unique to itself with the exception of a couple small caves, which were too dark for me to really distinguish whether they were the same or not. This game is enormous and there's plenty to do to keep you occupied. I think what a lot of people are complaining about is less about flawed game design and more about game design they just don't like because it's not what they expected.

The game boasts a larger map than the previous games and it's much more detailed.  The city has levels too in some parts, so it looks more realistic.  There are also no artificial or arbitrary limits in the middle like they were before.  You can easily glide in a straight line from any point on the map to its opposite without being stopped by a building you can't grapple to or glide over.

And glide you will a lot.  It's still the most fun and versatile way of travelling throughout the map, despite the new addition of the Batmobile.  The developers seemed to have realized this, since they force the use of the batmobile on you A LOT. And here lies one of the major problems with the game.  The Batmobile is useful sometimes, and it can be fun as well, but there are just too many missions, side-quests, challenges and collectibles that require it, and it grows tedious because the Batmobile is just not as versatile as Batman.  You can do dozens of things as Batman, while only a handful of things with the car/tank, and forcing you the less fun part of the game for so much of it makes it turn tedious.

Fortunately, Batman is at his most fun when controlling him.  Predator sections are still tons of fun, particularly with the new gadgets.  The combat is at its best here, with many more new kinds of enemies and abilities.  You have new fun takedown techniques that make use of the scenery, a new time-slowing ability or even other characters.  The fact that the combat is so fun makes it more annoying that so many of the combat sections are with the Batmobile, shooting drones.  There's a lot of variation in the Batman combat sections, but the Batmobile ones are all the same, only sometimes with more drones.  The game had yet again an excuse for not having civilians around, which is dissapointing, particularly because if there had been more missions and sidequests about helping civilians or making sure you didn't harm them, the Batmobile parts would have been smaller and better.

Now, there are two things the Arkham Series has done that made it stand out between comic book games (or licensed games in general): it made you feel like Batman and it delivered interesting and engaging storylines.  This game fails at both.  You definitely feel like Batman when you're playing as him, but less so when you're controlling the Batmobile, smashing EVERYTHING in your path and killing people.  Oh, the game likes to pretend you don't kill, by changing from live ammo to rubber bullets when you're targeting people, and shooting an electric charge that repels people who get too close to the car's front, but your bullets will smash into other cars and make them crash in ways no one could survive.  Sometimes the people can't get out of the way fast enough, so they will electrocuted AND smashed by the car.  So, either you're killing those people, which is un-Batman-like or you're believing the games ""unconscious"" labels, which are absolutely unrealistic.

Then there's the story.  And it's just bland and derivative.  Even Origins (which like this game was also not written by Paul Dini) had a better story.  I guess it wouldn't be such a bad tale if this is your first introduction to the Batman mythos, but if it isn't (and I don't see why should you start here) then you've seen everything before.  Furthermore, the story can only happen because Batman acts like an idiot sometimes.  And then there's the eponymous Arkham Knight.  Look, if you know anything about Batman, you figured out this guy's identity the moment the character was revealed when the game was announced.  If you don't know about Batman, the game will still make sure you know who he is halfway through it.  Yet then it dares to try to pass it off as a surprise.  And what happens after your confrontation with him is something you can't predict only if you've never seen a work of fiction before, or if half of your brain is in a jar for some reason (if that's the case, I recommend to stop reading right now and go get that checked out).  I'll grant you, the game does something unexpected at the end, but only because I wasn't expecting Batman to do something so profoundly stupid.

Worst yet, you can't even see the ending until you complete enough side-quests.  And you can't see the entire thing until you do 100% on the Riddler challenges, of which there are just too many, some of which are so badly designed that you'll swear the developers are trolling you.  I know it was always going to be hard to top my expectations after Arkham City, but what's jarring is that the developers are failing here at something they absolutely excelled before.  There's no ""new gen"" problems here, and at least Origins had the excuse of being from different developers.  Sure, the game is still tons of fun, and with how long it is there's a lot of value for your money here, but I can't just ignore the problems with the game because they hurt the overall experience.

So yeah, I give this game a 7 out of 10, which would be 3.5 stars, but since I can't give it that I give it four, since 3 feels like overkill.  It's still a great game and a must-play, but adjust your expectations accordingly.  Arkham City is still the best one in the series.",Great.

4.0,True,"11 25, 2013",A3K91X9X2ARDOK,B00FM5IY0Q,Terrence A.,"I just want to say that in two to three days of moderate playing, I've already killed something like seven thousand zombies. No, that number is not an exaggeration as there's a kill count up in the corner to let me know just how many of the living dead I've taken care of. Then again, it's easy to do that when you're driving an insane vehicle created by combining a steamroller and a motorcycle and using it to plow through their rotted bodies. And boy, is it fun.

Dead Rising 3 is a good, brainless time and an excellent way to kill time. The story is easily forgettable but its the experience that makes the game, not the silly tale that makes absolutely no sense at times. The controls are good but do get a little wonky at times, especially in situations that require a little finesse. The graphics are a slight step up from last gen but the draw here is the number of zombies that appear onscreen which is just outright ridiculous. No lie, you'll see literal herds of zombies, numbering in the low hundreds in most cases. The variation in the zombies is also cause to be impressed as you rarely ever find two that look alike, unless they're of a specific type like firemen or cops for instance. Improvements over past Dead Rising games include better AI for the survivors who join you, timed trials, a much larger map and even more weapons to make crazy combinations with. There's also co-op and the ability to use Xbox Smartglass, which allows you extra content. Gotta admit that it's kind of cool to get an actual phone call from an in-game character and get sent on a mission. Kinect integration allows you to bark out commands and even get the attention of zombies by yelling at them.

Dead Rising 3 is a perfect game to kill time with and even if the story reeks, that won't take away from the sheer novelty of butchering zombies by the boatload and using literally everything including the kitchen sink to do it. As far as Xbox One launch titles go, this is definitely one to pick up.","Take this! And this! And that! Oh, you want some too? Die! Get off me! (repeat)",1385337600,,,

Now that I have it in my hands I find that despite my anticipation for this game I was still surprised with this game.  It wasn't at all what I expected which for me its rare to be surprised by how the game plays (its usually just a matter of how well).  The simple reason is: you just can't sum up this game in a review/preview so I won't try.  What I will say is that despite being pleasantly surprised by this game I found myself increasingly aware of just how close it came to all-time greatness... but missed.

There are some weird/bad choices which hurt the pure joy of this game which I was made painfully aware of thanks to an TERRIBLE save/load system.  BEWARE!  IT is very easy to erase/save over your game... my GF saved over my first game because even when you start a new game it takes you strait to the last created save and you can easily delete saves by simply pressing Z twice while in the load screen (which I also did).  So,  by having to restart the game twice do to a terribly designed save system (I just don't understand how these things make it past testing) I had the ability to fully realize the reach of the game and where it falls short.

This game has so much more depth than you might realize and building up your kingdom is so fun that it becomes very disappointing that you can't do certain things.  I wish your people did more on their own or anything at all.  I wish you could assign people daily tasks, which wouldn't be necessary for all players but just a good way to get through the game more quickly if you are a skilled player.  Which reminds me, in some ways this games punishes you for being a thorough.  For instance when you make citizens get a job class there is a random element to how much life they receive, but since that is the only random element I find it unacceptable to settle for anything other than full possible health which i spend hours obtaining by reloading saves (until my save gets erased.  They should have just had everyone come out with the same health or at least have different things like attack strength which balanced this out.

A great game should be playable by players of any skill level with good gamers capable of achieving more such as a record of no deaths, however this game simply makes it frustrating by adding no skill elements to the equation such as the life thing mentioned above which has the result of simply being easier to not care if your people die (which it doesn't really matter).  However don't think this is game is easy either... its not!  I have to beat every boss for my GF because the actiony part of the game is not for her at all which reminds me: its too bad there is no pointer functionality in the wii-mote it could really go a LONG way in this game.  Also considering the way my GF lieks to play the game it reminds me of something else they could/have should have done:  make the treasure finding more extensive without requiring battle.

All that said its still a very good game and for anyone who likes Pikmin or Overlord you will like this game a lot.  The story is great... the cut scenes are fantastic and despite being unbelievably adorable its not just a kids game.

In the last few years I've become disenchanted with Madden for the PS and PS2 and I've slowly converted to the 2k series.  This year's edition is, without a doubt, the best NFL football game I've played.
First, let's discuss the game mechanics.  Unlike Madden 2002 (I've not played this years' edition so I'll have to compare 2k3 to 2002) the passing game is not incredibly difficult.  Sure, it's not easy and you will have your share of interceptions and dropped balls.  However, I haven't had anything close to the difficulty I had with learning the Madden passing game last year.
As for the running game, I've had some difficulty with this, but that is mostly due to the fact that my offensive line is less than stellar.  When they do show up I don't have nearly as hard a time.

The A.I. in the game is very good but not ridiculously so.  In some football games it seems as if the computer always ""knows"" what play you are calling, and it's defense adjusts accordingly.  In 2k3 I've been able to catch the defense napping and they will blow the coverage (something which most certainly happens in the NFL).
The graphics are second to none.  Honestly, I don't see how you could get better than this.  The stadiums are beautifully rendered and the crowd is so much more realistic than EA's Madden and NCAA 2003.  Whether it's a sunny day or in the middle of the rainstorm, the PS2 is certainly up to the task of handling the graphics.

Finally, the game is deep, don't let anyone fool you.  You have the NFL combine, the draft, the rookie signings, salary caps, etc...  If this game was any deeper it would pretty much be a waste.  As it is I have had a hard time using all the stuff, and on some occasions have had the cpu complete the task for me.  However, the best thing is that the commentary in 2k3 is WAY better than Madden.  There is a larger variety of comments, which, when combined with ESPN style presentation and weekly highlights, certainly puts this game over the top.
Sega, in my opinion, has knocked EA's Madden off it's throne, and none too soon.  Football fans rejoice in this classic game. Rather than complain about Madden, the ... commentary and the fact that EA is riding the wave of past successes, go out and get the best NFL game on the market.","Great fun, Great Game!",1029542400,7,,

This D-pad is twist-able: twist right=plus sign, twist left=same crappy disc it's always been. That said, I don't know why anyone already looking for a better, more accurate D-pad would choose the disc, but hey, whatever ;) The shinny plus shaped D-pad is better, but it still is a bit problematic -- for me it is up/left, it still goes either up or left, but I have noticed an improvement in the other ""off"" positions. For fighting games it does ""roll"" through combos more accurately. How much more? That's hard to quantify depending on player style.

Ultimately is this new controller worth the $60 price tag? NO, not when I bought a plain white one from Amazon a few months ago for $28/$29 on sale -- right now (2010.11.17) the black glossy is on sale for around $35 (although no battery or cable for either). Unless you play games that use the D-pad a lot, really like that grayish-silver color or need the play and charge set-up it is probably *not* worth the price-tag.

A couple of caveats besides the D-pad, the buttons are very ""flat"" in appearance -- 2 clearish (A and Y), 1 smokey (B), and one dark gray (X). I will eventually swap these out for lit-up versions of the standard color format (whenever I get time to take the controller apart and solder a few wires for the new buttons...not anytime soon, but someday) Also the trim is duo-tone: black for the chat pad connector, as well as bumpers, triggers and battery packs (the play and charge cable is now all black as well) -- then gray for the thumb-sticks and the ""off"" positions of the D-pad (up/left & right, down/left & right)and the A,B,X,Y buttons.

First of all, there aren't many differences between 2K6 and last year's superb ESPN NHL 2K5 besides some new fixtures in the game's presentation and the new rules implemented into the NHL.  The rosters, which underwent a major makeover this past summer, remain the same as they did before the lockout happened, but nevertheless, NHL 2K6 is still the best of this year's NHL video games.  The new Pro Control passing system is a nice feature, even though the gameplay can be a bit chaotic at times, but despite that, the gameplay is still superb.  The rest of the controls are pretty tight, and the graphics still look good.  Oh yeah, the 20 dollar price tag isn't a bad touch either, compared to EA's NHL 2006.  However, if you own ESPN NHL 2K5, you can still alter the rules (no two-line pass calls, changing the overtime option to a shootout) and the rosters to the current NHL status, so if you already own that game, NHL 2K6 isn't worth picking up.

If you've played the earlier games, this can be both good and bad: Good if you don't mind playing levels you've played before with new graphics and modes (there are 4 total), and bad if you do. Fortunately, the soundtrack is very rewarding if you enjoyed the music from the other Katamari games, since it consists almost entirely of remixes. For example, there's a version of ""Sunbaked Savannah"" from ""We <3 Katamari"" played by a high school band, a Pac-Man remix of ""Katamari on the Swing"", and a mashup of ""Everlasting Love"" and ""You Are Smart"", to great effect. The game's theme song, another remix of ""Katamari on the Swing"" entitled ""Katamari on the Wings"", gives a good idea of what the soundtrack to the whole game is like, since it's essentially a lounge remix of a swing remix of a catchy theme song.

Sure, the d-pad is a little sharp around the edges, but the A and B buttons are so snappy! Games like Mega Man that require fast presses to get bullets off quickly are so much easier with responsive buttons like these. I thought the rectangle shape would be weird, but I tend to hold it more like a SNES controller and it feels just fine. Highly recommended.

Update: I've now used it a bit more and also had a chance to compare it with a good condition original controller. I will say that the buttons basically feel the same as a nice original controller, and this appears to be nearly the same dimensions, but that leaves me with a couple gripes. First, the d-pad is too small. It's not a huge issue, but it's too easy to hit diagonals and I think a bigger pad would solve that. Second, although the glossy finish on the d-pad is the same as the original, no Nintendo controller since has had that, and for good reason. Your thumb sticks to the glossy finish more, meaning you can't slide around the pad as easily as you normally would. It's kind of annoying. And it still has those sharper edges.

Graphics....5/5

The graphics are great. Very welldone. The Enivermont desighn is fantastic. Great job...

Gameplay....4/5

TO MANY CUT SCENES!!! MGS 1 HAD MORE GAMEPLAY THEN THIS!

And this game is wayyyy to short...Takes about 5 hours to beat..It took me about 4 hours and 34 minutes..But I skipped most of the cutsences....And I hated the way the ending was...I would have liked it more if it was Snake Vs Ocelot in a metal Gear ray boss battle...More better from my opinion then Raiden Vs Abunch of Metal Gear Rays.

Sound...5/5

Superb..Music is great..

Overall Mgs2 doesn't quiet Match up to the Original MGS which Alot of people think is the Greatest Adventure game ever made...I think so to.

If the question...Is MGS worth buying the answer is..YES.

This game is still a classic and one of PS2's Stronger points.

Not as good as PSX's original Metal Gear solid but one step below. But MGS3 will be the best MGS ever!

So go out and buy this game if you really like MGS and don't be turned off by the game just Cause Raiden takes the place of the Legendary Snake who happens to be in the game for about 45 to 50 minutes...Still it's a great game...Haven't played Substance and don't on planning it either...

Downhill Domination features an incredible sensation of speed and a canted camera that will make you leave your stomach at the top of the mountain. Narrow trails, treacherous terrain, and the fast gameplay really ratchet up the tension-it's hard to keep up, and you almost forget to do tricks in the mad scramble to stay upright. Avoiding polar bears, mountain goats, hikers, vehicles, and maybe even a sasquatch or two is all part of the frantic fun. Less enjoyable is the amazingly blatant product placement-bike brands like Trek and Specialized make sense, but while you pedal, billboards for online auction sites and energy bars peddle under the guise of earnable sponsorships.

These cables brought back crisp pictures and clean sound.  Makes the PS2 playable again and 'durn sexy' on a big screen.  The PS3 looks good, too.

When I saw Ninja Blade at a used media store I was taken back by how little it cost, for what seemed like a fairly enjoyable game, similar to Ninja Gaiden (note: Ninja Gaiden 2 for the Xbox 360 is kicking my butt, but I fully plan on finishing it, have picked up Sigma for the PlayStation 3, and am semi-interested in picking up others in the series).

When I popped it in I was impressed with the visuals, and then the quick time events started. And they never stop. If you're as poor at quick times events as I am, expect to have approximately half your time taken up by them. Of course, I kid, but only slightly.

However, after finishing Ninja Blade, I was actually rather happy with the game, and can absolutely see myself putting it in in the future to pick up some of the achievements (less than half) that I'm missing. Sure, the quick time events are harsh, but the ability to replay them with little ill-effect tones the frustration down.

I also rather liked the story, which reminded me of The Third Birthday and Drakengard (keeping in mind that I read an English translation of a Nier book).

With the exception of weapon switching, which is mostly due to the 360's inferior d-pad, the game was also rather fluid, suffering from only a bit of slowness at extremely 'intense' periods of activity.

If you like Ninja Gaiden's game play, and aren't afraid of fairly intense quick time events, definitely give Ninja Blade a try.

There's definitely a niche of gamers that this will really apply to, but should still be a worthwhile purchase (or rental for those who can play for a week straight) for any RPG fan in general.

The story is by far the strongest point.  There will be times that make you cry, times that make you laugh, and times that make you so raging mad that you forget a certain character is fictional - like a good book.  Great cinematics, great voice acting, great plot.

The combat is fairly hit-and-miss (no pun intended).  It took me until my 15th hour of playing to really figure out how to use combos and party orders (focus, combo, free, etc) to my advantage.  Learning how to get some HP and MP back by using ground combos was very important.  However, there is rarely a chance to take advantage of Connect skills, since you can't call for healing while connected, and battles are too fast or too on-the-edge to bother with another character's skills.  Many of the boss fights are great and very challenging - sort of from the Kingdom Hearts genre.

One major disappointment, although I am still a good 5 hours from the finish, is that the game brings strategic situations into play with a flourish, then all but ignore them for the rest of the game.  The first hour of play is heart-pumping escaping and racing the clock, then soon after that is a great siege scenario... then it drops off to the occasional ho-hum ""win before time runs out"" scenario, if at all.  They could definitely have taken advantage of multi-party situations more - so far there has only been one (absolutely fantastic) section where that occurred.

I couldn't be happier with my purchase, though, and the only reason I probably won't play through it again is that so many good RPGs have come out or are coming out for the 360 - Vesperia, Last Remnant, Fable II, etc...  hard to keep up with!","Rough around a few edges, but very well done",1224633600,24,{'Edition:': ' Standard'},

There's not that much difference year to year, so if you have the prior year's version I could not justify the $60 for minor upgrades and such. However, if you're new to the PS3 console or new to the sport, this is a good one.

As far as positives go, I really like the way the clubs handle as far as the swing itself goes. The analog stick works well. It's very easy to learn and control and hit decent tee shots. Also, surprisingly, I like the new putting system. I'm not very good at it, but it's easy to use, easy to handle. The create-a-player is very good too.

As far as the negatives go, in the create-a-player career mode, some of the putting greens are maddeningly challenging. Some of these are nearly impossible on the higher-stakes tournaments. For a casual gamer like myself, it can be frustrating.

The ability to play online against someone else - especially someone else's create-a-player - is really fun too. It's a great way to pass the time rather than just playing by yourself, locked away in your basement. So a big plus for that.

The Bad: Little in variety of enemy types, very linear, combat is tedious after awhile, semi-poor level design, HL2 engine is starting to look old

Before I start here Dark Messiah suffered bad reviews because of all the terrible bugs that launched with the game. now that 2 1/2 years have passed Dark Messiah's bugs have been pretty much been ironed out and you now have a pretty fun action RPG. Before I start explaining the game DM uses the Half-Life 2 engine so you can expect some wonderful graphics and effects. DM uses the HL2 engine very well, but the engine is a bit supped up so you'll need a fairly beefy rig to run this game. If you computer was being pushed with HL2 then your computer will have a hard time running this game. I also have to mention that DM felt a lot like Oblivion Lite in the sense that it is set in Medieval times, melee combat is first person, and the art style is a little like Oblivion (not as unique of course).

You play as a young protagonist named Sareth and you must stop the evil Arantir from using the Skull Crystal and bringing the Dark Messiah back to life. You have a choice to either stop him yourself or let the Dark Messiah live on. The story is actually fairly interesting and will keep you on the edge throughout this 15-20 hour adventure. Now DM is a linear RPG (it's not free roaming like Oblivion), but makes up for it with a intricate combat system. You have about 30-40 different item slots and you can carry things from health, mana, weapons, magic etc. As you progress through the game you will earn skill points for completing objectives and you can upgrade a variety of things from endurance, health, stealth, archery skill, learn new skills such as heal, fire arrow, freeze, sanctuary etc. There's a lot to learn and you won't upgrade 100% in a play through. You can either concentrate on being a Knight, Mage, or Archer or just go down the middle.

There are a variety of unique weapons you can pick up throughout the adventure such as the awesome rope bow (shoot an arrow at any wood overhanging and a rope will come down), ice staffs, flame swords, poison daggers, and even a cool electricity shield that stuns enemies when they attack you. Now there are no shops where you can buy things so everything has to be picked up throughout the world. This keeps the action constantly going, but will disappoint people who are used to having stores in their RPGs.

Combat consists of left clicking for your basic attack, but if you hold it down you do a Power Strike and whether or not you strafe, move forward, or backward will determine whether it's a side swipe, impale, or overhead strike. This can let you easily dodge attack and quickly strike back. You can use the right mouse button to block (and when you get the ability) left clicking to knock enemies back. Hit enough bad guys and you'll get your adrenaline bar up and this results in a gory slow-mo instant kill. This applies to all weapons and each of them have their own unique advantages to them. You have a kick button and this is great when you are on a ledge so you can just kick them off. Every so often you'll find spike beds on walls you can impale enemies on, also you'll find traps that can be kicked down to crush enemies.

While the combat is really fun and you can do a lot with it; it will get repetitive after about half way through unless you use different weapons and toss things up. Every so often you'll find a blacksmith room where you can add bars of metal and forge your own weapons. Now when it comes to enemies there aren't to many of them (knights, undead, spiders, necromancers, evil demons) and that's about it. They are mixed up a lot, but you still can get bored of them after awhile.

Every so often, though, you will get a great boss fight and these are huge creatures that require key items in the environment to kill them. These are pretty awesome and are very satisfying to take down. My biggest complaint must be the level design. A lot of times you won't find most of the hidden secret areas since they aren't even in places you'd remotely think they'd be in. There will be times you'll wonder around for over 30 minutes in the same place wondering where to go and this has to do with poor level design. The levels are very linear, most of the time dark, and really hard to navigate. Other than this Dark Messiah is a pretty good game, and you can even get it off Steam for $10! I highly recommend Dark Messiah to any action RPG fan.",A very entertaining RPG,1332892800,8,{'Platform:': ' PC Download'},

4.0,True,"05 11, 2016",A1YBLPSMIYHF3U,B00Z9LUEGA,J. Butler,"I picked this game up based off of a lot of comparisons to Persona 4 Golden. I really enjoyed that game and thought I would give this one a spin. Now in reality, how close in likeness are the two games? Well they both have high school students as the main characters, there are social links you can develop when you spend time with people outside of main quests, there is a quick movement option via the [ ] button, the old schoolhouse in Trails of Cold Steel is very reminiscent to the dungeons in Persona, and then there are the general RPG elements they both share (equipment, leveling, turn based battling). I'd say they are similar enough to recommend this game if you enjoyed Persona as well.

Now onto the main review!

The game looks really nice on the Vita. There is also a PS3 version available, but I was more interested in playing on the go than having HD graphics. Even when you look at videos comparing the graphics, there isn't that much of a difference. Besides, you probably won't even notice on the Vitas screen. Now, if you pop the game into your PSTV, that will probably look pretty crappy.

The music is a real stand out for me. Lots of great theme tracks that are extremely catchy. I would even compare them to some of the best FF tracks. They are really quite something. The voice acting is a little wonky at times. Some of the emoting falls a little flat or sometimes over the top or there is just no VO at all. It is pretty serviceable for the most part.

Controls are good. Dual joysticks make the game a joy to play on the vita. You control the camera with the right and you move your character with the left. R trigger lets you run and the other buttons do what you would expect.  Touch screen controls are pretty minimal. I am pretty sure you only need to use it when you are saving.

Story is good for the most part. Nothing mind blowing, but it is keeping me engaged so far  I am only on chapter 3 so I don't have a full aspect of the story. I heard the ending is a little anticlimactic, but I guess that would explain the sequel coming in September.

As fun as the game is, I do have a few issues with it the hurt the rating slightly:

1. Despite textures and character models to be rather decent, their bodies are extremely rigid and usually unexpressive during dialog. They sit or stand awkwardly with their arms at their side almost 99% of the time. Dialog scenes can get a little dull when you are watching mannequins talk to each other.

2. There are too many points where you watch a cut scene or have some dialog, then you move a few feet, only to have more dialog or another cut scene. Was it really necessary to have me move the character just to interrupt?

3. The load times can get very tedious. They happen when going into and out of battle and whenever you enter a new area. They range from 4-7 seconds. That doesnt seem like much but it does add up after a couple hundred battles.

4. The blade card game is total bull. You play it any time you are on the train to your field study. You can challenge the people you are riding with, but I will guarantee you will lose. You think it is a simple game of War with a few wild cards thrown in, but the computer always seems to get super lucky.  Everyone wrecks me, there doesnt seem to be any way to play an easy opponent  everyone is good! It gets lame when the comp uses three bolts and you lose because all you have is a mirror card. Fun. At least you still get battle link points despite losing.

5. The game doesnt get laggy during gameplay, but there are weird dips and stutters when the camera pans during cut scenes. It is not really game breaking, but it is slightly noticeable sometimes.

The limited version is very nice. The box is very sturdy and it comes with a thick softcover art book. There are some spoiler points in the book to be wary of, so it is recommended to read after you finish the game. There is also a pin, but that is not that exciting. There is also room in the box for the other game coming in September

All in all, I would definitely recommend this game. I would say to get the PS3 version as the limited edition is about 15$ cheaper right now. There is cross save for the game, so if you end up getting the vita version you can transfer your save to play on the go.",Very Solid Game,1462924800,9,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Personally, I view this more as DLC as I think the Mario campaign is the primary game-play people should experience first, before playing this.

Super Luigi U is one of the best bits of console-based dlc that Nintendo has done.  Some criticize that they just altered the Levels from NSMBU.  Who cares!? the level design from the Mario version is amazing and is super fun.  The altered physics and altered levels make this worth every penny to me as the whole game plays differently, and there is an added time constraint; making continuous progression a do-or-die scenario.  It's super fun and now that me friend and I have 100% completed the Mario campaign, we're going to try to do it for Luigi U (yea the thought scares me a bit).

My only complaint, is that they could have at least re-worked the bosses too.  Knowing how to out-fox the same bosses moves (If you played Mario Bros U) sort of takes away from the end of world reward, but it's still fun nonetheless.

The climactic ending to The Dark Knights story is going out in a bang, with a few speed bumps along the way. It is all centered on Batmans most notorious foe, Scarecrow, who is threatening to unleash a huge dust cloud of his deadly fear toxin. This causes the citizens to quickly leave Gotham City and leave Batman to do his thing while all the thugs and low-life stay behind and attempt to take out The Bat.

The game opens up with The Joker being thrown into a cremation oven, reaffirming that The Joker is indeed dead. That doesnt mean that the clown is gone though. Throughout the game Batmans psyche is slowly breaking down with all the combat and attempts to do what is right, it definitely takes a toll on Bruce Wayne. This is represented with The Joker making random appearances in Gotham, taunting Bruce and constantly jabbing him in his side with twisted, psychotic words. The game is very narrative focus and does an excellent job telling its story with fantastic cinematography. As Batman attempts to takedown Scarecrow he is encountered by a new mysterious villain, the Arkham Knight. A highly skilled fighter with military gadgets at his disposal, this character knows a whole lot about Batman, calling him out on how predictable he is and where exactly to shoot at on his body armor. You eventually uncover the truth behind this proficient fighter and what his motives are as you further into the decent into madness.

The help of the new-gen systems gives the city life with chaotic anarchist roaming the litter filled streets as police attempt to chase down criminals in high pursuit car chases. The visuals are stunning with Gotham giving off a moody atmosphere as the city is in the process of crumbling down. The pebbles of rain bounce off Batmans suit as he sits high above the skyline planning his next move to take down the evil within the city. Believable voice work from excellent voice actors bring the characters to life even with a tad bit of cheesy dialogue.

The fluid combat system is still intact, requiring you to pretty much button mash and quickly respond to certain queues in order to counter-attack, disarm or avoid an enemy altogether. Its simple yet very satisfying to be outnumbered 20 to 1 and completely wipe out an entire room. A new feature is the ability to do a duo takedown, what this means is occasionally you will run into one of your allies. Whether it is Robin, or Night Wing theyll team up with Batman to take down a handful of thugs. While the duo is in the middle of a battle they will initiate a team up to knockout the vandal, at the same time this will switch you into the role of your ally. It is a nice little feature that can give you a break from playing as Batman, even though the characters pretty much all play the same.

The biggest thing Rocksteady was keen on showing everyone was the addition of the bat mobile. Being able to cruise around Gothams street while firing up the thrusters and taking out the menacing hoodlums is handled well overall. I never found myself getting stuck up on walls because the armored vehicle takes out chunks of concrete on impact. A huge emphasis on the bat mobile is the fact that it can turn into a tank. This mechanic, while cool in concept (and for the first couple of times), gets pretty old fast. More towards the end of the game do they really start to shove the tank gameplay down on you, which is really the only downfall in this game.

Final Word
Rocksteady has taken a licensed product and proved to the gaming world that it is possible to make something extremely great. Not once, not twice, but three times. The city of Gotham glistens with chaos as rain pours over the beautifully detailed skyline. Batmans story will keep you hooked and comes full circle with a great ending.

So 10 years later, the game that started this trendy era of COD games is just as I figured it would be, a FPS juggernaut masterpiece. Of the 3 Modern Warfare games in it's trilogy (2007-2011), this wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.

I remember back when I was in High School in '07 and when I read reviews for this on IGN, Gamespot and so on, I couldn't bear to understand why is every gamer and critic was praising Modern Warfare 1 giving it all straight 5 out of 5s and 10/10s. Now I know why, you would think after 2006's Call of Duty 3 (PS2/Xbox/PS3/Xbox360/PC/Wii), gamers were starting to get bored and tired of war based games being in focus of covering WWII well this game changed the landscape of this just like how Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight changed the landscape of superhero cinema and how Michael Bay's first Transformers film (same year this game came out) changed the way how dumb popcorn action flicks and general hollywood blockbusters should be nowadays. It's part of #KeepingUpWithTheTimes #ForgetThePast.

Modern Warfare is intense and jammed packed with fast shooting, intense gameplay, brutal combat, concise gameplay and story, well rendered battle enviroments, and the multiplayer mode types that tend to, since this one, to be repeated in use in almost every Call of Duty following this one which was why I was so sick and fed up with this Modern COD stuff everyone was going for everywhere online. Now 10 years later, Call of Duty WWII has/is come out and we are back to the era that made Call of Duty famous since 2003 and when it put my former favorite FPS war franchise (Medal of Honor) to death.",The Game That Started a trend for new FPS's then and now........,1509667200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

We were also supposed to have access to our previous Rock Band 1, 2 and 3 library along with the other games.  You still cannot access those songs.  They did however let you download your Green Day tracks if you had the license for it.

No surround sound support.  This really aggravates anyone who is an audiophile.  We had the option in previous games but not this one.  It doesn't make any sense.  They did state they were going to patch it in sometime in November.  Again another unfinished feature.

4.0,False,"10 9, 2015",A2TCG2HV1VJP6V,B00004U1R2,Ryan Sil. (Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev),"I'm sure many of you reading this know about the strange history Conker the Squirrel has had himself wrapped up in before claiming the spotlight with Bad Fur Day, but in case if you don't, here's what happened: This game started life as a kid-friendly platformer named ""Conker's Quest"" (which got renamed into ""Twelve Tales: Conker 64""), but with the collectathon 3D platformer genre growing increasingly (with Rare's own Banjo Kazooie adding fuel to the fire no less) and how some critics mocked the child-friendly approach of it, the folks at Rare decided to crank it all up to THE EXTREME, and in 2001, this was the result of the new mindset.

Conker's Bad Fur Day is anything BUT your ordinary 3D mascot platformer; there will be blood and gore, cursing up the wazoo, movie parodies, and sexual antics aplenty! This is a primary example of a game that does what it can to stand out from the rest of the crowd, but fortunately, there is indeed wit behind it all (even if the surface is full of total nonsense). It's basically the video game equivalent of South Park before the show decided to directly enter the industry with The Stick of Truth. And to think it was developed by RARE and published by NINTENDO no less!

The presentation of it all is something to behold. Right off the bat, Conker gets completely drunk and meets an equally boozed-up scarecrow who struggles to tell him an important aspect of the game, fights a giant opera-singing monster made up of crap, gets turned into a bat to throw civilians into a wooden grinder, fetches a beehive that doubles as a machine gun turret, drunkenly pees on rock people at a strip club for such, etc! Nowhere else can you find the kind of absurd adventures that this foul-mouthed squirrel embarks upon, and the characters and their dialogue exchanges are the best kind of raunchy comedy you could find. For example, there's something truly hilarious about a paint pot and brush verbally trashing a gay pitchfork's attempt at kicking Conker's ass.

While those aspects of the game are arguably some of the best moments of gaming out there, the gameplay itself isn't as remarkable. Conker is able to run, jump, and fly with his tail, sure, but nothing feels anywhere as grand as in, say, the Banjo Kazooie games; the platforming challenges are rather small and confined, and there are several times where the game would end up coming off as more of a point and click where I happen to control a character instead of a cursor. While that may not sound so bad, there will be some times where Conker would have to fetch several objects for someone or something, and there would be too much of those objects to collect; despite the Great Mighty Poo being one of the all-time greatest bosses, the process of getting to meet him was tedious since you had to fetch him EVERY corn tooth for him to use as teeth.

The ""context-sensitive"" actions that Conker can do by pressing B make things interesting, but it's more situational than grabbing a power-up in another game. Some actions can be pretty fun to use or add to the game's comedic value (Pressing B in the Matrix parody level causes Conker to jump in slow motion), while others can be frustrating through means of a delay in Conker's animations (Do not press B as soon as a bat flies towards Conker! He won't take out his flamethrower in time!). Really, the gameplay and control are generally rather flawed, but they don't hamper the experience to a point where it ruins the game.

Cutscenes and worlds tend to feel like rewards for your efforts in overcoming certain challenges the game throws at you, and in that regard, the game is definitely a constantly rewarding experience. I just wish the play mechanics were stronger than they were in actuality. With all that's said and done, however, Conker's Bad Fur Day is a game that I believe is worth checking out if just for the unique comically raunchy performances alone, with the game itself doing okay enough to bridge the funniness together. That is, if you DON'T BUY THE NINTENDO 64 CARTRIDGE!! $85+ for only this game is simply CRIMINAL. Just get a copy of Rare Replay for the Xbox One instead. Live & Reloaded may be cheaper, but censoring every curse word in there equals a stripped down experience...","""Hey, this is a neat joint!""",1444348800,,,

The Bad: Almost no story or dialog, repetitive, short, art style is wasted on bland environments

The newest RPG hybrid is probably FPS hybrids and since these are so new Borderlands can be considered one of the first to perfect it. While Fallout 3 holds the crown let's just say Borderlands is the prince. If you have had a hard time grasping FPS/RPG hybrids then let me put it simple for you.
Like in traditional RPGs you have elemental attacks. In Borderlands you have these and they consist of corrosion, explosive, fire, and lightning. Some guns can be fused with elemental powers so i.e. a lightning combat rifle will deplete enemies with shields faster than just a normal rifle. A shotgun with corrosive powers can kill creatures faster than a gun with lightning powers.

Another element that you should be familiar with are stats. Just like TRPGs Borderlands has damage, hit accuracy on weapons. You get shields that have certain aspects such as when they deplete they send a wave of corrosive acid, or they recharge faster, or give you a health boost etc. You also get grenade mods which change the way your grenades act just like guns. There are also specific class mods that can increase some of your stats even further. Additionally, each character has a specific ability they can use and you can equip special spheres that add attributes to this ability. Sound like a TRPG so far? What about enemies? They too have levels and shields and the damage you deal to them will bounce off of them in a series of numbers along with the experience you get once they are killed.

There are a lot of little tidbits such as the money system, you can purchase items or upgrades at vending machines, saving clap trap robots can give you more storage space, there are healing items, when you kill an enemy you can loot them, you can also loot the dungeons you enter or the open world. See, it still sounds like a TRPG. What makes it different? Just add guns, a vehicle you can drive and shoot from, and a fast travel system. The way to play in all this fun is co-op. More players+harder enemies=better loot. Good math in my book.

This sounds fine and dandy like nothing can go wrong, but Borderlands has its issues. While the game play is actually pretty flawless with lots of guns such as rocket launchers, combat rifles, SMGs, and revolvers etc. The content is very thin. There isn't much to do, but run around the barren wasteland completing the 150+ side missions and 50+ story missions. There is hardly a story or any dialog. You're just running around trying to find this Vault with some special treasure. All the loot is the same and even the storage bins you find them in get's boring to see after awhile. While the game has a pretty neat cartoony graphic style everything is brown and boring and it makes the neat art style put to waste.

The difficulty isn't something to complain about since it increases as you level up. Each area has to load separately and the load times are longer than they should be. Most of the side missions vary from scavenger hunts, to killing people, looting, and more killing, but the core game play is really shallow, but the stuff it's wrapped around is flawless. This game is really meant for people who just want a straight forward shooter with some more depth and a twist. While it does feel more arcadey than Fallout 3 and more pick up and play it just doesn't have that charm and amazing feeling to it. Borderlands is executed well, but just needs more filling to make it superb. However, the game is highly addictive and even though you know you're doing the same thing over and over again you never get tired of it. The game has a level 50 cap, and can be completed 100% in less than 20 hours, so Borderlands is a great purchase for any shooter fan.","An addictive shooter, but lacks story",1332892800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Basically while on a vacation trip you (Jason Brody) and your friends decide to go sky diving. They land on the island whose inhabitants vary from normal villagers, wild animals, and a bunch of pirates led by Vaas (he's the guy on the game's cover) who take you captive and hold you for ransom. His plans are to get ransom money from your parents and then sell you to slavery. But you, with help from your brother, escape and now the real fun begins as you travel the island in search of your friends. Eventually you meet up with the group who opposes Vaas and the pirates they are known as the Rakyat's. Upon leveling up and completing missions you earn different tattoos which in turn give you different abilities which are focused around stealth takedowns, assault takedowns, and long range takedowns. An example would be say there's two enemies and you sneak up on the first and silently kill him with your knife then you throw the knife into the second enemy.

Along the way you will meet allies and many enemies. The story is pretty deep and each character is well developed in my opinion. It is very interesting to see Jason's transformation over the course of the game. There will be plenty of twists and turns in the story and it will probably take you around 20 hours to complete. I think the vast amount of wild life is really cool just to name a few there's alligators, leopards, wild boars and there's even sharks. Along with the wildlife there is a lot of different weapons to use one which will become a favorite is probably the bow and arrow. While playing the campaign there will be optional objectives to do such as finding collectables, killing certain members of the pirates, hunting specific animals and doing Rakyat Trials.

Additionally to the single player main campaign there is also a side campaign which can be done in co-op and it is much shorter missions focused around a different group of people. And there is also online multiplayer although it doesn't compare to any of the blockbuster games that come out now it is still enjoyable for a while.

Gameplay wise, JC3 hits most of its marks-- the ever-present grappling-hook and parachute return, while new features like a wingsuit and the ability to attach tethers to objects add new avenues of physics-based insanity to the mix. Fooling around with just about anything in JC3's enormous open world can be a hoot, but mission structures and some mini-games miss the mark. Gotta love that wingsuit, though :)

Story-wise, JC3 improves upon its predecessors, but that isn't saying much... characters are ridiculously thinly drawn (not a complaint, but not an endorsement either), the dialogue's somewhere between giggle inducing and groan inducing, and plot is an affront to brain-cells. That said, JC3 features a charming setting filled with lemming-like denizens to goof around with, which is what Just Cause games are about most of the time, anyways.

Usually if a major-flaw reveals itself which dis-immerses me from the game, I get bored and quit (such as with Dishonored; the fact that you have to load every few minutes if you want to ""good"" ending).

This game does have a few ""pay"" features which many people gripe about.  Personally, being a 29 year old man with a kid and wife... playing video games is a luxury I rarely get to partake in... so when I do get to play I'd rather not spend 3-4 hours grinding mobs for money/items.  Having a job that pays $25/hr it makes more sense for me to dish out a few dollars so I don't have to grind so long.  Yet on the forums people whine about this feature which I do not understand.  If they don't like it, they don't need to use it.  The game doesn't seem to make you rely on DLC purchases and plays out like most conventional RPGs.

First the cool parts, you have Minecraft along with all of your worlds right there on your wrist, and backed up on the cloud for the first year for free.  That is nice if you are a huge Minecraft fan for the PC/Mac/Linux world.  Usually I actually play Minecraft on my PS4, so I can play couch co-op with others.  I also purchased a copy for computer, which I used for this review, since the Gameband doesnt give you a license to use Minecraft you have to buy that separate.

The band itself is very simple to set up, you basically create an account for your gameband.  You then can open it up and start playing Minecraft pretty much right away.  I tried this on two different Gamebands, and it worked on my Linux laptop which is a few years old now with no hitches.  This laptop does have a dedicated graphics card, and everything after the initial load was very smooth.  It ran as well as if it were running on my laptop directly even though the files were served up via USB, so I was pretty happy with that.

Other than Minecraft, there is also a display on the band that can show time, custom messages, or images.  I tried all of these, and you can scroll through each of them by hitting the button while the display is still lit up.  I was not able to get this configuration to work on my Linux laptop.  Both of the bands I had complained that there was a problem, and that it couldn't connect to the Gameband even though I could play Minecraft on it just fine.  I messed around with that for a while, but never got it to work, in the end I just did it on a windows box, and it worked fine.

The only other thing to be aware of is that when you shut down Minecraft the saving/backup to the cloud takes a bit of time before you can eject the Gameband.  Overall it was a pretty smooth process.

As for why I wouldnt wear this, it just isn't something I need daily, I don't play Minecraft other than at home, so having the save files on a portable device though cool, is really not a huge advantage for me.  I could see where it would be really nice if you played Minecraft in many different places.

When I first played this I didn't get into it, usually preferring the faster paced L4D when it comes to zombies, but I picked it up again and actually got sucked into the story.

The gameplay ranges from between dialogue options and Silent Hill-lite, which sound very limiting but they actually pull off the dialogue well, where many choices aren't easy and you get to see how exactly your decisions affect the other people. Some parts were obvious while other parts were surprising, so the writing quality fluctuates a little throughout but overall it's held together through strong characterizations.

Some people have complained about how despite being able to make choices, the story still follows a rather linear path where you can't alter the story. While it's true there's some enjoyment from like a Fallout game where you can manipulate the outcome, the story for this game is compelling enough to where it is what it is, an interactive movie. The story is long and complicated, so I'll just organize the episodes from least favorite to favorite (spoilers of course).

4<2<1<5<3

4. They finally reach the big city, and what happens? Not much. For a big location this one was really underwhelming in every sense of the word. Plus many of their actions were either really obvious or contrived. For example I knew what was going on with the blonde chick with the pickaxe really early on, and yet they wait until near the end of the episode for her to literally sit there and spell it out, at this point I wanted to find a wall and start pounding my head against it. Also there was a lot of potential with Crawford, but it just becomes another dealing with walkers situation, when it would've been cool to run into a gang of them holding out or something, and be stuck between crazy people and walkers instead of more of the same. Also there should've been more of a sense of urgency when on that mission but there just wasn't. Could've been great.

2. The entire episode felt like they just put the story on pause and it came out as filler. Sure you could make a point that the people were learning to get used to their predicament, they ramped up the tensions nicely but the farm subplot felt distracting and it was disappointing when I figured that the entire story pretty much happens in one location. Because of it being contained though, if people were to play just 1 episode I'd suggest this one. Also I didn't like how they throw in a random new character that wasn't in the 1st just for him to get killed off, would've been more ballsy to off a known character from the first one or set him up better. Still the mystery has a nice payoff and you get to know the characters a lot more.

1. Gets everything started, it's interesting how when you first meet people they're not too concerned about the outbreak (Bill from L4D1 apparently makes a cameo), but as it goes along people are starting to realize that the danger is for real, so that worked nicely for me. Though the pharmacy part did have some slow boring moments and one of the characters was basically just the old white guy from Night of the Living Dead. The episode was good enough for me though to continue the story, so definitely interesting enough. Also the motel puzzle was heaps of fun.

5. The finale! Things wrap up pretty nicely here, there's a lot of adventure that goes on, and the walls are constantly closing on our characters. Also the mystery at the end was well done, I didn't expect it and it made sense. It was pretty short though, but I prefer it to be short and sweet instead of dragged out. Especially considering how the 4th one ended it makes some sense that it'd be short. A satisfying finale to a long but good game.

3. My personal favorite, after 1 sets everything up and 2 kinda stagnates but you get to know the characters, 3 shifts things into full gear, and whereas the show is somewhat predictable and non-compelling, this episode revealed that the game just don't give a f*** about who gets offed, and many moments caught me completely off guard. Not a dull moment for me in this episode, it showed just how dark and utterly engrossing the series could be.

So you'd like this if you want more to a videogame then a mindless escape, it's not necessarily fun, but it's engaging and is essentially an interactive movie. I wish they would lay the pressure on more at certain points, but again, Walking Dead is more about the people dealing with the zombie crisis rather then zombie action, so it worked. I enjoyed the hell out of this game and am looking forward to a sequel. Little things here and there annoyed me, especially how the characters are rather reckless when it comes to being around the dead, and it sucked seeing the protagonist get bit over a dumb situation. Also, like almost all zombie lore nowadays, they completely skip over the outbreak and do the 28 Days Later approach where you're in the aftermath. For once I'd like to be in the middle of the outbreak chaos, maybe one day...

It's kinda sad when a zombie video game has better characters then most zombie films, each character looked like a normal person instead of an action star, they all had distinctive personalities, and they weren't black and white villains or stereotypes. Instead they all felt like real people, which is the spine to this game. If they felt like cartoon characters the story wouldn't have worked out. Especially impressive is Clementine, considering I normally hate escorting children in video games. If she was some cutesy/whiny rugrat I wouldn't have gotten past the first episode, but because of the good writing and characterization, it all clicks.

Basic premise - you control a dog, who goes around and solves crimes.  You use point-and-click with the Wiimote to solve various puzzles and close the case.

The game works well with the wii's controller, which functions almost as well as a mouse.  This port is a wonderful fit, and I'm glad to see it on the Wii.

I was initially skeptical due to the goofy cartoon style, but don't let that fool you - the game still works well for an adult.  The humor isn't exactly what I'd call side-splitting, but it serves to mix things up, and I've found myself laughing more than a few times.

The puzzles are varied, and the number of items you carry around is reasonable.  The solution to puzzles is usually logical, if not always readily apparent.  We have gotten stuck in ""random click mode"" a few times, but upon discovering the answer it felt like a ""duh"" moment on our part rather than some sort of sadistic game design.  These puzzles make sense, and you're given the tools you need to solve them.

PRODUCT REVIEW:

Since it's release,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NHL-09/dp/B0047T7JKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NHL 09</a>&nbsp;has left many hockey-mad gamers ""chasing the dragon.""  Though the title came out, revolutionized hockey video games, and monopolized the hockey game market; many players have been wondering if EA will ever manage to outdo itself again.  When I reviewed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NHL-12/dp/B004WL4LP8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NHL 12</a>, I indicated it was comprehensive, but that the overall gaming experience left a lot to be desired.  I originally wrote a gushing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NHL-13/dp/B007FTE33E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NHL 13</a>&nbsp;review based off the demo until the gameplay pulled me back to reality and forced me to give it an average review; which lead to me testing this out one more thoroughly so I didn't repeat the same mistake again.  So how does NHL 14 fare?  Some of the gaming could stand improvement, but this is the best title since NHL 09.

One of the improvements that EA touted this year is that the goaltending AI has been refined to do a better job at anticipating the shot.  This may not seem like a huge deal to your casual gamer, but this is an IMMENSE BOON for anyone who plays the goaltending position regularly (like myself.)  I can finally say that the goaltending AI doesn't want to surrender a goal on every 9 shots taken by the computer.  Instead, you're now in control of making sure you've covered the angle (which is a challenge in itself) while your goaltending AI does a better job of stopping the shot.  This, along with the anticipation feature that was introduced in NHL 13 and the butterfly function, allows a human-controlled goaltender to be in the game just as well as the computer goaltender. There are certainly some defensive deficiencies that the AI-controlled players on the human-player team experience (more on that later), but the improvements in the goalie functions allow for you to overcome that through most games.

The new fighting engine flat out ROCKS!  Though the fighting is in third-person now instead of first-person, the fighting now occurs as a direct result of what happens in the game and not just through instigating a fight using the Triangle button.  Take a shot at a goalie when the whistle's blown or lay out a massive hit to a star player?  You better be ready to defend yourself!  What's more is that there can be multiple altercations at once, so if you're playing with and against others online, it's entirely possible to have a full-on line brawl.  The fact that there can be multiple fights at once makes it better than in the games of the past, but there aren't any instigator penalties handed out for third-man-in fights and players aren't thrown out of a game if there's a second altercation (this should be changed to both make it true to life, but your casual gamer probably won't care either way.)

Be A Pro has had a facelift as of this season and is now known as Live The Life.  In addition to playing out your pro's career, you're now tasked with saying and doing all of the political things a player does to ensure their popularity improves amongst the fans, management, teammates, and their families.  Say the right things and your endorsement deals begin to appear, fans chant your name, your teammates and family love you, and management wants to give you the contract you deserve.  If you say the wrong things, you'll end up traded to a different team, which can have a detrimental affect on other things.  Though most of this was spot on, one thing I didn't care for was that any answer that bashed the team somehow raised the player's popularity amongst the fans.  Maybe I'm a minority, but I'm not going to cheer for a guy who bashes his team.  Otherwise, the new features make an already fun game mode even more fun to play.

The Be A GM feature has had some revisions as well in this year's game.  You can set the trade difficulty to be separate from the difficulty of the gameplay and the difficulty of the franchise mode.  You can also grant the AI more control to administer the team to the point where the only necessary human interaction is scouting; as even goalie rotation can be handled by the AI now (I suppose EA could have simulated scouting as well but what's the point of playing the game if the AI's going to play if for you?)  Thanks in part to the lower salary cap, there's a significantly better chance of catching a big free agent during the off-season then there was playing last year's title.  However, as the salary cap inflates, teams will be more likely to retain star players through the ability of being able to bury salary without giving other teams the option to claim the players; leaving either depth-role prime-aged players or veteran-aged castoffs with declining ability as the only options to be made available through free agency as the game goes on.  The fact that teams can circumvent the waivers through the pre-season roster management presents a hole in the game that can stand to be patched; I'll make a suggestion for this later on.  The only other problem with the Be A GM mode is that injuries intensify the deeper your roster is; so it's like you're being punished for actually building your AHL team as well.

The game has other features and improvements as well.  Winter Classic has been expanded a bit to give you the option as to which venue you wish to play at (meaning either the Winter Classic '11 or Winter Classic '12.)  The NHL 94 mode provides a retro-style hockey experience complete with simplified controls, old-school soundtrack, and the classic celebrations whenever you score.  You can select your position prior to accepting a drop-in game when playing online.  The soundtrack has gotten more rockin' again, as it was great to see Soundgarden and Bullet For My Valentine on the soundtrack (I do wish Blackguard would come back though!)

Otherwise, the gameplay hasn't changed drastically.  Taking face-offs in this game has never been smoother, so that was a very happy surprise in comparison to previous seasons.  Dishing out body checks feels more real-to-life in that your larger players can steamroll the smaller players, but larger players can also be adversely affected by poor balance as well.  This remains a shooters game for those of you who prefer to put the puck onto the net.  The passing isn't terrible, but there seems to be a difference between executing a pass within a game and executing a pass online; so it could stand revamping.

So with that all that said, this title is excellent for the casual gamer and great for the gamer with slight or moderate interest in hockey.  If you're looking for a fun hockey title that's better than the more recent titles and updated from NHL 09, then this is the game to get.

ROOM TO IMPROVE:

Though this is excellent for casual gamers and well enough for those who are interested in hockey, this game can still cause frustration for the hardcore hockey gamer who's sees the annual NHL installment the way most gamers currently look at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grand-Theft-Auto-V/dp/B0050SXKU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grand Theft Auto V</a>.  The leaps and bounds shown this season was awesome and shouldn't be discounted, but there's always room to grow.  With that said, here's what I'd like to see for next year:

-  The passing engine should be revamped, as the AI has an easier time connecting passes then human-controlled players do.  I would love to see the passing being done with R2+Right Paddle, where the strength of the pass could be determined by how hard the paddle was pressed in that direction (the pass could be cancelled by releasing the R2 button without having executed the pass.)

-  Change the defensive players for the human-controlled teams in the goaltender Live The Life mode to be better than movable pylons.  The back-checking should be more aggressive and the players should intentionally get into the passing lanes.  Playing as a goaltender, there's still too many instances of ""cheap"" goals that get scored against a human goaltender where the defense breaks down and leaves the goaltender on their own because no one's coming back to play any semblance of defense; if your player's already positioned there then it's fine, but the AI won't do it as a reaction to the gameplay.

As a general example, I often find myself in the situation where the opposition will come up the rush and while my defender will be on them up to the defensive-zone face-off circle, the defender will actually turn away from the play and head for the boards, giving the attacking forward the opportunity to set up his shot without interference.  The attacking player will go to an area inside the dot where it's too far to poke-check but too close to commit to the butterfly; often resulting in a goal.  In a more specific example, I was playing as a member of the Winnipeg Jets facing the Anaheim Ducks.  Though I successfully poke-checked Corey Perry twice, he still scored on the third attempt in the same sequence because AI-controlled 6'5"" Dustin Byfuglien can't break past 5'10"" Kyle Palmieri to make a defensive play because the latter's stick checking was too intense; even though they were 3 feet away.  This goal was followed up by a 2-0 in my direction after the face-off because apparently, having a goal scored on you makes your teammates forget how to play defense.  (I could complain that my AI-controlled centers win 10% of their defensive zone face-offs, but the resulting shots are low-percentage so I really can't moan about the stat fluffing.)

Further, if the coaching options are changed by the player during the game, the game should maintain those settings instead of changing them.  It's frustrating when you begin to realize this occurred when the opposing team begins to attack and your players aren't responding the way they had previously (I'll set the offensive pressure to Aggressive and the team will play fine, but then the AI will change it to Defend Lead, where my team loses the ability to skate the puck past the red line.)

- Revamp the Be A GM mode to give the GM a more realistic gameplay.  There should be a full-on training camp for the preseason mode with an intra-squad scrimmage followed by 6 or 7 pre-season games where you can have up to 50 players (either on one-way, two-way, minor, or ATO/PTO contracts) where you can cut or designate them for assignment after each game; players who aren't waiver-exempt would be available to be claimed by the other teams instead of stashed in the minors as they are currently prior to the start of the season.  There should be an option to allow GMs to manage their minor league teams as well.  GMs should be able to add no-trade or no-movement clauses to contracts so they can negotiate better terms with their players.  Much like the Live The Life mode, the GM should be able to receive positive (or negative) performance boosts based on their actions.  Finally, an assistant GM upgrade (which would increase the chances of a trade being accepted/give better feedback on trades) would be better than adjusting trades to be done either easy, medium, or hard (I wholly admit I requested to see the option of selecting trade difficulty independently of the difficulty in the game in my prior reviews; but now that I've seen it in action, I have a preference towards wishing to see an Assistant GM upgrade that could provide detailed feedback as to whether or not a trade would be accepted by the opposition. As you upgrade your Assistant GM, you'd get better feedback on a trade along with better chances that a trade would be accepted, regardless of the trading block settings.)  Perhaps the AHL veteran limit could be imposed to prevent teams from stockpiling talent.

-  With the online drop-in game, actually divide the rooms based on skill level. Have a drop-in room for amateurs, rookies, et al, in addition to an Open Skate room for players of all skill levels.  I hate seeing newer players get bullied by those who dedicate their lives to EA NHL games because it discourages the newer players from getting better; but the established players don't deserve to see their stats suffer because the other players aren't at their skill level, either.  Open Skate means you run the risk of getting jeered by the jerks with mics or having your stats suffer because a level 56 goalie's leaking like a sieve.  And if an amateur player is able to upgrade their equipment to boost their stats, then either they dedicated that much time to playing the Live The Life mode or they were willing to open their wallets to purchase the upgrades; both of which seem fair to me.

-  Finally, can EA get the KHL on-board?  Could Live The Life see a player go to Europe instead of any of the North American leagues?  I would love to see these refinements as well.",The Best Since NHL09; Vastly Improved From Last Year's Title,1380067200,25,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I don't really have the time to sit and grind at a game for days on end like I used to be able to.  Unfortunately I haven't really given survival mode, zombies, or the campaign much of a chance.  If that's what you're looking for, go skip ahead to another review.

Call of Duty's multiplayer has been the bread and butter of this franchise since it's introduction.  Black Ops 2 has overhauled the whole system into a familiar yet different packaging.

As you may know, Black Ops 2 takes place in 2025 and many of the weapons in this game reflect that.  Don't get me wrong, there are still several guns carried over (Scar, MP7, Remington 870 to name a few) but most of the guns in this game are either based on current weapons or completely new.  This can be a little confusing at first because the familiarity of the M16, M4, Barrett M107, and several others are only found in the campaign mode.  This is going to take some time trying to familiarize yourself with the nomenclature and characteristics of each of the weapons and how well they work in a multiplayer environment.  However, after a short amount of time, you should be able to notice which guns have their similar counterparts in the other CoD series (M27 = M4, SWAT 556 = M16) and so on.  So you're not left completely in the dark.

CoD's multiplayer has been progressively getting faster paced as the franchise ages and this is easily the fastest CoD to date.  This has lead many people including YouTubers (Woody's Gamertag, Drift0r) who have said this can be the most frustrating and rewarding Call of Duty ever made.  Treyarch accomplishes this by decreasing the size of the maps, making the spawns closer to the action, and balancing the weapons where nearly any gun can be used on any map depending on the gametype and your playing style.  So this game works well for people who want to run and gun, PTFO, or hang behind.

This is also the first CoD that really rewards people who play the objectives, taking domination flags, picking up dog tags, using the UAV, and getting assists.  This is something that has really benefitted me.  In MW2, BO, and MW3, I would get mega assist points per game (8+ on average), but had an average KD of 1.00.  Personally, I feel like this game is suited towards my playing moreso than any CoD to date.

That doesn't mean that this game doesn't have it's issues either.  So to shorten this review, here's a pros and cons:

Pros:
- Huge rewards for playing the objective
- Pick 10 system allows you to pick up to 3 attachments on a gun, any perks from any of 3 tiers, multiple perks per tier via wildcard, secondary, no secondary, extra lethal grenades, no lethal grenades, tactical grenades (or 2x), and so on.
- Weapons level up like MW3, but you don't lose them when you prestige
- Gold and Diamond gun camos are something fun to work for
- More different attachments than ever before
- Smaller maps = more action
- All weapons are good in the right hands on most maps
- Killstreaks are based on score, not just kills.  So you get points for playing objective, getting kills, assists, UAV as mentioned
- I enjoy the new maps, you're rarely more than 10 seconds away from combat
- Prestiging isn't something you hate doing now, nothing to lose really
- No matter what you're using and what you're doing, you're adding to some sort of longer term score or leveling up a weapon, which feels very rewarding.

Cons:
- Still no matchmaking from what I can tell
- Some scorestreaks are a bit overpowered*  Many of the high point scorestreaks that are OP will take significant skill to attain
- Smaller maps lead to short lives
- Some attachments are OP (target finder, although fun, is way too easy to use)
- Spawns are terrible.  I have literally spawned in people's crosshairs.  Other times I have spawned with an enemy in my crosshairs.
- More people tend to back out of games, and it takes longer to find a game and get into one.
- There is an issue with the lag compensation and bullet damage, 99% of the time the person initiating the gunfight will win.
- The dolphin dive/dropshotters are still annoying, however it has been nerfed some
- Although most guns are fairly even, some are clearly a notch above the rest (remington 870, MSMC or PDW, FAL)
- The spawns and face paced does lead to a lot of camping and spawn trapping
- No real graphical improvement
- Knife is extremely difficult to use, I find myself bumping into enemies and then having a shootout before considering the knife
- Grenades feel much weaker than MW3, which were already considerably nerfed.

Sandy Ravage in one of his videos said that this CoD has the steepest learning curve of any CoD to date.  I would have to agree, but once you find a few guns you like to use, use them a lot, prestige the guns a couple times, then try out a couple more.  Once you get the hang of this game, the initial frustration tends to fade away and quickly become the most fun Call of Duty to date.",Online review (Xbox Live),1359590400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

4.0,False,"07 14, 2013",A3BN2M8R5QOFE5,B000P46NMA,Summer Paulus,"I have been playing Assassin's Creed since the first game. I'm not shy to admit that I'm pretty obsessed with the series and am already happily looking forward (with a little too much enthusiasm for my family to handle) for AC 4: Black Flag and the next ""Vita,"" release.
This review is not for those that want an ""in-depth,"" look into the game itself, but one of my own personal experience with the game, it's pros and cons, likes and dislikes. I will go on and state why some people find this game ""lacking,"" the feel of an AC game, my first experience of the game and the overall scope of where the ultimate opinion of mine lies after playing the game for 30+ hours.

[So much dislike and why?]
Why do so many people dislike this game?
Assassin's Creed III is a game that some consider to be one of the weaker installments of the AC series. A lot of people state that the game didn't ""feel,"" like an AC title.

[Character]
One reason could be because of the character Connor Kenway, (who wasn't as charismatic as Ezio or as familiar and nostalgic as Altair) didn't live-up to the expectations of many fans. To many thought Connor didn't come off as that ""fun,"" character everybody was expecting when it came to an AC title, or as ""deadly/cocky,"" as Altair.
For me he WAS boring, at first. After playing the game for a couple of hours I held this belief until I came to the realization that, yes, he was certainty not Altair or Ezio. He was not one of the original assassins racing through Syria killing Templars and doing his Master's bidding; or an Italian avenging his families deaths and leaping over canals and flirting with masquerading ladies in Italy.
What a lot of people didn't ""see,"" (and a friend helped point this out to me) is that Connor is a very humble person, and a Native American, no doubt. If the developers made Connor like Altair or Ezio, he wouldn't fit the character of a Native American trying to save his people.
Consider this: Connor couldn't be like the two assassins that came before him and that's okay. I'm glad the developers made Connor the man he is, because as fans we need change, and Connor is exactly that.
For he fought for what he believed was right, for his people and for everybody else... and he really didn't NEED to.

His first objective was to save his people and his tiny village and in the end he ended up saving the very people that had harmed his village to begin with.

You couldn't exactly have a cocky Native American whom had sworn to save his village from the in-coming White Man and still be likable. After a while, at least for me, I would had felt a little peeved that this guy thinks he can stroll around among the American populace boasting how his people were here before THEY came and how he was gonna take it all back. I for one, wouldn't had liked that outcome, and I can see why the developers made Connor quieter and more sympathetic.
Besides, we really don't need another Ezio.

[Assassinations?]
Not much on this front and it's a little-bit of a letdown. A reviewer had stated before me that this game didn't feel like an AC title because of this and I can clearly see why.
AC III is based around the American Revolution, plane and simple. It's not one of you solely killing your enemies or avenging your family, no. But, just like EVERY AC title, it's rich in history and ACIII beautifully lets us experience it all first-hand.
And yes, Connor was recruited by Achilles Davenport, the last (or one of the last) remaining assassins in the Americas. And he is, indeed, an assassin.
But I felt like the creators wanted to really show-off the rich events that took place in America's history. And I'm sure there was assassinations that took place somewhere in all that.
But the American Revolution had to be fashioned and fixed to an AC title, and therefore it is a little awkward and out-of-place. I felt like they focused too-much on all the history and not nearly as much on what the series is as a whole. Too little assassinating, and a little too bloated in everything else.

[Gameplay]
I had received the game after racing for the closest store to purchase my copy of AC3, I was pretty excited to start playing what I thought was gonna be another amazing game in the series. I also had high hopes that AC3 would do the series justice, after the big letdown of ACII: Revelations.
At first I was pretty disappointed.

The first patch wasn't installed yet and the game had some crazy bad glitches. It seemed that yet-again the game developers had rushed the game for release. Climbing over an object my character (Haytham Kenway) would suddenly flop about until after a minute he stopped having his ""seizure,"" and I was able to proceed (this happened after casually trying to make my way over a railing of a theater).

After the first patch, however, the game play did improve. I was now able to leap over railings without a care. But, I'm still not entirely loving the gameplay. Especially when it comes down to taking out my enemies...

Whenever I get into a fight and after killing a British soldier he drops his musket, and while I'm posed over his dead body, waiting for the other British solder to make his move, I go to block his attack and instead I end up picking up his musket, which ends with me being stabbed-and-or-punched, which results in a LOT of damage or my immediate death. After a while this becomes extremely frustrating, especially after a five-minute fight to take over a Templar Fort. I end up having to move Connor away from the fallen musket in order to continue blocking/killing my enemies. Meanwhile I kept on thinking: Why couldn't the developers make the ""pick-up,"" button different from the ""block,"" button? I hope they fix this problem in Black Flag.
Another thing (that other reviewers have noted in their reviews) is running up or over objects they did not intend to climb up/over. Imagine, your chasing after an Almanac page, your running across a rooftop and nearing a towering chimney, you intend to run past this said chimney and receive your ""prized,"" page when suddenly you stumble up the chimney and awkwardly hop back down and the page drifts upward and out of reach, dispersing into thin air... You had failed to catch your prize, and all because of bad programming...
Yes, this has happened many times whilst I'm happily racing after the last page that would had given me the recipe of a new gun or new clothing and I climb up something I did not intend to and am left standing while the page drifts away. It's actually VERY frustrating and it would had been nice if the developers had taken some time to polish the game over before releasing it to the masses.

Lastly, I never really noticed it but my fi pointed it out to me today and now it bothers me quite a bit. When you go to open a chest, the screen shows you placing the tool to pick the chest in the keyhole and than when you place the ""other,"" pick in the hole it sometimes shows-up above. This isn't really THAT big of a deal, but now that he has pointed it out to me, I notice it all the time. Here I' am, unlocking a chest, pushing and turning the tool and it's NOT IN THE HOLE! Instead, it's wedged above, in the wood, magically (I'd wager).
Like I said, it's not THAT big of a deal, but why couldn't they fix this little problem? Little things like this makes one wonder if the developers are being lazy and are just trying to push out new content in order to meet a deadline?

[I LOVE ACIII!]
But it took a while...
Actually, it took a long, long while.
I have beaten the game under a month ago and I actually stopped playing the game entirely for a while. At first I couldn't make myself play this game, because I stated before, it felt out-of-place in the AC Universe. But I FORCED myself to finish it while recalling that AT LEAST it was better than Revelations.
And after beating the game, I went back and played through all the side quest: Liberations, Assassination Contracts, Letter Deliveries, Feather-Gathering, Hunting and Homestead Missions. This is where the game truly becomes fun! I've spent many, many hours collecting various animal pelts and helping people-in-distress. And it was well worth my time, especially when it came to the homestead missions. The game really gives the game depth and rewards you with extra outfits, recipes and weapons.
Ultimately, the naval battles are where the game truly shines! At first I wasn't crazy for them, it was hard, but after getting used to the mechanics and unlocking all the naval upgrades I wish there was more! Here you are, a captain of your own ship and you see on the horizon an enemy fleet. You let lose your sails and charge forward into the pack of ships, where, coming aside a vessel you fire! and the enemy vessel goes up in-flames. You than turn your view and see a smaller ship aiming their cannons at you, and you fire a cannon ball at their weak point, where the small ship then sinks satisfactory into the thrashing waves... You than look onward as more ships suddenly pop-up on the horizon, just BEGGING to be destroyed! Life on the sea is good.
If you didn't like the naval side-quest than you must be ill or mentally handicapped, I'm just saying.

Overall, this game isn't your typical AC installment. It should be set apart from the other two parts of the series and viewed as something entirely new. Desmond is still at-large as the main protagonist and his story finally comes to an interesting end. But concerning his past Connor, his story is one more of America's Revolution than of him being an assassin. And ACIII is really not that bad of a game.
I just hope that the developers take-in what everybody has said and make the next game an ""assassin,"" game again and not one of re-telling history. If I wanted a history lesson, I would open a book, watch the history channel or take a class.
AC Team, I appreciate all your hard work and it must be difficult giving your financial-pocketers amazing content and endless enjoyment in a beautiful series that you have created. We don't hate Connor, we don't HATE ACIII, but we just want a truly ""assassin,"" game. I have faith in Black Flag, but until than, I will continue to enjoy and appreciate Connor and his part in assassin history.

4.0,False,"05 9, 2008",A2YQ5O6XV23543,B0012RCNUA,Kevin Dudley,"Over the last few years since SNK's surprising rise from the corporate ashes, the long running game company has released some anthologies of their more celebrated titles on their 1990's arcade game machine Neo-Geo.  To date they have released World Heroes Anthology, Fatal Fury Battle Archives Vol. 1 & 2, Metal Slug Anthology and the Art of Fighting Anthology.  On the horizon are a King of Fighters Anthology and a Samurai Showdown anthology (YAY!!!!).

Why am I mentioning this?

Well, it's due to the fact that SNK has included the 1st World Heroes, Fatal Fury, King of Fighters, Samurai Showdown, Art of Fighting and Metal Slug games on the new SNK Arcade Classic Vol. 1 for the PS2 and PSP.  Being that this collection has 16 games on it (you have to unlock World Heroes BTW), 4 (soon to be 6) of those games are already on other anthologies that hardcore SNK fans have already bought.  That leaves 10 games (Baseball Stars 2, Burning Fight, Last Resort, King of the Monsters, Magician Lord, Neo Turf Masters, Sengoku, Shock Troopers, Super Sidekicks 3, Top Hunter) that someone owning the anthologies wouldn't have already.

So who was this collection targeted to? I'm guessing the more casual classic games fan that might want more of a sampling of what SNK had to offer in the 90's instead of diving into the individual anthologies themselves for some of the gamns. However this will have some people like myself buying a collection of 16 games that has 6 on it that I already own. Also, there is the argument of people wondering why they put some sequels on here but didn't put some of the best games of other respective series on here like Fatal Fury 3, World Heroes Perfect, Samurai Showdown 2 and Metal Slug 3, Sengoku 3 instead of the 1st games of those long running seires.

One thing this entry has going for it is sheer variety. You have everything from action platform games to sports to shooters to one-on-one fighting to beat-em-ups.  A few of the games can get a bit monotnous on one player (Burning Fight and Sengoku) in particular but while being far from the best types of games in that particular beat-em-up genre, since this only costs 15 bucks it makes the uneven quality of the games somewhat even out.

Being a Shooter fan, I absolutely love Last Resort and the Mercs style overhead shooter/action game Shock Troopers. We also can't forget about the action/platform masterpiece that is Magician Lord. That's still one of my favorite games of all time.  Baseball Stars 2 is still one of the most fun pick-and-play baseball games of all time IMO.  Turf Masters is also a lot of fun even though I'm not that much into golf games. And the original Samurai Showdown is still a classic regardless that the sequel bettered it in terms of number of characters and backgrounds.

The emulations are pretty much dead on and I found it funny that Last Resort which was plagued by slowdown on the Neo Geo has almost no slowdown on this version which makes a maddeningly at time difficult game even that much harder.  Some people have complained of slowdown in certain games but to be frank I haven't seen it. Also, the version of Metal Slug on here doesn't suffer from the load times on the Anthology version, but the control does seem to lag a bit in comparison especially when the action gets really hectic.

If you're a casual fan just wanting to sample what SNK was about, this is a terrific deal to see what the NEO GEO was during it's prime.  If you already have the before mentioned anthologies, then it'll depend on how much you want one or more of the 10 remaining games on here.",Uneven but still fun compilation of Neo Geo titles.,1210291200,3,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

I completed this game and earned every PS4 trophy, so I definitely explored almost everything. Overall, FFXV is a pretty enjoyable game, but is definitely not without its flaws. I'll summarize below:

The good:
Graphics - a large, open world that looks absolutely stunning, and really has amazing detail.
Music - As typical of final fantasy games, the music and score was immaculate.
Battle system - I personally love the action-based battle system in this game. The only other titles I've played in this series were the active-turn based system, but it feels more gratifying to actually master a technique instead of simply pushing a command button and having the character act it out like a puppet. Plus, it offers a challenge, as pure melee attacks are a quick way to die as you progress to the more difficult enemy battles.

The bad:
THE STORY. I didn't enjoy the overall story. Without going into spoiling details, it felt like Square Enix's version of the Book of Job. The first couple of chapters of this game took a long but enjoyable time to complete with the sidequests.  But by chapter 8, it really felt like the game grabbed you by the arm and pulled you in a linear direction towards the finish line (However, you can return to the open-world to level up and prepare to face the final bosses).

Much like the other FF games I've played, the final bosses were a joke compared to the optional bosses and dungeons, which felt anti-climactic. But if you want to complete this game as quickly as possible and stick to the main quest line, they should pose a much better challenge.

I'd still recommend this game, especially in terms of the music and visuals.",4 out of 5 - a decent game,1488844800,2,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",

When Voyager was catapulted into a distant corner of the galaxy  far beyond any hope of reinforcements  Tuvok, the ships executive officer, formed the Hazard Team, an elite corps of Starfleet commandos capable of facing any threat.  Armed with a variety of weapons and trained to operate equipment on any alien starship, the team stands ready against whatever the Delta Quadrant can throw at it.  Unfortunately, Munro is a bit too impulsive (as s/he proves at the end of the first level), and stands to be kicked off the team.  Instead, fate intervenes and the team is forced to take Munro along when the ship is snared by an alien ship and brought through an iso-dimensional rift into a vast graveyard of other alien ships.  With Voyager too severely damaged and drained of power to escape, the Hazard Team is pressed into duty - boarding other ships in a desperate attempt to learn the secret of the aliens that hijacked their ship, and to find the means to escape.  The game relies on both alien races both familiar (Klingon, Malon, Hirogen and Borg) and new.  The levels aren't too long or complicated, and a tight storyline beautifully keeps the game running.  Between the missions is a mix of cut-scenes (using the game engine, ala JK2) and interactive scenes in which you prowl the halls and lounges of the Voyager and mingle with its crew.
Theres a lot to love and to be disappointed with in this game, which is nevertheless the king of Trek games (at least until EF2 debuts later this year).  Level design is a mixed bag of great and bad  with my clear favorite being the Scavenger ship, a huge space station composed of salvaged starships like a Klingon Warbird and an early 23rd century Constitution class starship (that level excels because its such a mishmash that you never know what you're going to see next).  The game wisely starts its action aboard an Etherian starship, whose wondrous insides resemble less that of a space-going vessel than an acid trip.  Unfortunately, those are the early levels.  The game maintains its edge with an infiltration mission on a Borg cube, only to lose it afterwards, when you find you must infiltrate other alien ships manned by either sentry robots or the harvesters and reavers - vicious and robot-like aliens.  The game also has a wonderful design engine that gives some of its non-player characters a wonderful individuality (whether its your team mates or the aliens).  However, that tool, embedded within the Icarus engine, is barely relied on for the aliens  and most of the aliens youll meet are faceless and uninteresting hordes.  (The exception being that set aboard the Scavenger ship  where we hear Klingons complaining about their food, Hirogen discussing their latest hunts and humans playing an unending game of 3-D chess).  Gameplay is hampered at all levels by the games simplicity  though lightyears past Wolfenstein much of EF has you prowling the hostile corridors of enemy territory, pretty much blasting whoever you meet, and finding the exit.  (Again, the Scavenger level is best because its a stealth mission, requiring extra precision; even so, you spend so much time hiding, that you cant afford more than quick glimpses of the scenery).  The designers probably felt like they could only make a game that was either a fragfest or a thinking mans RPG, and that wed be grateful whenever it was both, for even a second.
This is actually my second review of this game, though I had to do a follow-up after having played Jedi Knight 2 which is also based on the QIII Arena engine.  Though older than JK2, Elite Force (EF) holds up pretty well.  Its not as long as JK2 (you can easily finish the game in a week after playing a level a night) nor as difficult (the enemies aren't quite as overwhelming as in JK2, and the game relies on far less counterintuitive puzzles than that game).  On the minus side, its not as challenging and the simplistic game play gets annoying really quick (instead of puzzles, you have to locate control panels, which your PDA will ID on any alien ship, and throw their switches).  There are two genuine boss-levels in the whole game, and maybe twice as many true frag-fests.  Echoing the differences between the Trek and SW universes, EF probably sees itself more as a thinking-mans shooter, but won't make you think too hard.  Though you won't need to be any kind of Trekkie to get through or even enjoy the game, fans will appreciate how the QIII engine renders their ship.
I played this on my P4 (2Ghz) XP machine without any hick-ups.  I haven't tried multi-player yet, but managed to get by without downloading the 20mb patch (which I eventually installed for the heck of it  the only difference Ive noticed is that Seven is actually voiced by Jeri Ryan).  EF isn't as finicky about your choice of accelerator cards, accepting my S3 Savage4 card.  In short, a great Trek game, and one not to be missed before Elite Force 2.",follow-up review,1049241600,,,

The release of Anniversary Collection on Street Fighter's 15th anniversary should have had Street Fighter fans jumping up and down in delight.  Instead, Capcom has delivered a compilation that, while worth the cost, is far from perfect.

Hyper Street Fighter II combines all five of the Street Fighter II iterations into a single game.  Had each game been selectable on its own, Anniversary Collection would have been the best fighting game ever released.  Unfortunately, all the versions are essentially crammed into a single game's space (think Mortal Kombat Trilogy here), and while human-versus-human battles are as fun as ever, the computer always plays as the Super Street Fighter II Turbo characters with all their super moves and what not.  Worse yet, the CPU difficulty is set way too high on this game, so that even expert Street Fighter II players can expect to have difficulties on the easiest difficulty settings.

The addition of Street Fighter III: Third Strike to this package is nice, and anyone who did not pick Third Strike up in its original Dreamcast release should buy Anniversary Collection to add it to their library.  Third Strike is practically arcade-perfect, and arguably represents the highest evolution of 2-D fighting games.  However, next to the Street Fighter II games, Third Strike seems perhaps too evolved, incorporating too many advanced gameplay techniques and graphical geegaws.

For the price, Anniversary Collection is a must-buy for anyone who likes fighting games.  However, fans from the Street Fighter II days who want to relive the old days are advised to track down the old PS1 Street Fighter Collection discs (and suffer through their long load times) for the best old-school experience at home.","The Greatest Fighter, but Not the Greatest Collection",1115769600,,,

I played the Smackdown vs Raw series for years and when I finally got to play this game I noticed it had a lot solid new things that current WWE games borrow from(like interrupting a move). There's some strategy to the matches and it looks great for a gamecube game.

-Gameplay
 It's more of an arcade type of fun game mixed with in with some strategical spots much like the Smackdown vs Raw series(WWE 12'13) series. Unlike the new WWE 12 and '13 games, the moves look much more violent and aggressive while at the same time more exaggerated. It makes for fun gameplay. The finishing moves don't always finish the match. The higher rated guys needed to be really beat down before they can get pinned. Things like interrupting a finishing move was implemented into this game long before WWE '13.

Presentation
-Entrances all pretty well done. No commentary just the games soundtrack during matches. Post match celebrations. The works. The main menu looks cool.

Graphics
-In 2013 I find it amusing that this 2005 wrestling video game looks graphically better than any WWE game on released on the Wii years after. The crowd and wrestlers look real detailed and you could find comparison videos. Great looking game, Surprisingly good looking game.

Features
Story mode takes your created wrestler into a big story line and your starting from the bottom and working your way to the top. Stats and attributes are earned the more you win so it's takes a bit more effort and strategy to win at first.

As of 2013, the game is still more than playable. It has aged well and for those looking for an alternative to the current set of WWE games then this game is more than worthy. The only thing I didn't like is the fact that I had to go specific season mode moments to unlock legends like the Rock and Hulk Hogan. Older WWE games always made it harder to unlock legends and etc.

You start the game going through a little story intro and a bit of a bus ride.  Shortly after a bit of introduction you'll be asked to select one of the characters and exit the bus to start your adventures.  The game doesn't come right out and tell you these are your ""classes"" but for the interests of the RPG elements of the game that's what they are.  Your choices are basically between stealth/special weapons, sniper, support/healing, and tank/melee.  There unfortunately isn't a vast amount of customization in their looks available but you can alter a 3 color scheme for their outfit and customize your name almost immediately after stepping off the bus.

From here you do a short and sweet tutorial which throws you right in to the action relatively quickly.  The controls are tight and will be very familiar to fans of popular FPS games such as Halo, Resistance, Gears, Unreal, and many others.  You have the ability to jump, duck, melee, shoot, toss grenades, and eventually use a class specific special ability such as placing turrets.  Aside from the general control of your character menus are easy to navigate for all of your weapons, the map is easy to read, and the HUD is simple and informative.

Following the tutorial you progress the game from doing various quests.  These quests can be found on mission boards, from NPCs, and occasionally from random stuff lying around.  The quests themselves so far haven't been anything particularly noteworthy in the grand scheme of RPGs.  It's still a lot of ""kill XYZ"" ""collect a fistful of whozawhatits"" or ""go talk to random NPC"" but they have streamlined them enough to where the don't feel forced but rather serve as more of a beacon of where you should realistically be taking your character and scoring some nice exp and loot while you're at it.  Quest objectives can also be tracked and objectives are clearly marked on your compass.

Outside of questing there are a decent number of monsters to kill.  I still don't really have much of an idea as to what dictates when an enemy will respawn but it seems if you wander around enough you will likely run in to something to kill.  It's typically not a mindless slaughter either, I would highly recommend trying fighting tactically much like you would in a shooter.  Until you out-gear or out-level your opponent you will find that the game can actually be quite challenging at times and reward clever use of your equipment and abilities.  The game did a great job of encouraging this too by making your enemies respond to grenades logically, implementing cover well, and of course rewarding you with devastating critical with our beloved' HEAD SHOT!

Sizable amounts of experience can also be earned through completing various challenges which are like in game achievements, some of which are actually tied to achievements/trophies.  It's mostly killing various things with various weapons but early on it's a great source of experience and you can track your progress on them.

Starting at level 5 you will start to acquire skill points every level.  These are used to boost various abilities of your character via a talent/skill tree.  There aren't a lot of choices and you can get quite a few of them with the number of points you wind up with but most of them are fundamentally decent options allowing for some individual diversity in how you build your character without having to over-think it.  Aside from that each level your character will get a generic health, defense, and attack boost.

The weapons are pretty cool but I will state that some of the ""87 Gazillion"" claims were perhaps a bit exaggerated.  While it is true that many of the weapons can do quite a bit of unique things, the vast majority of the weapons and gear you will find are going to be slight variations of each other much like any other similar dungeon crawler such as Sacred, Titan Quest, or Diablo.  Perhaps later in the game the unique generation of weapons becomes more apparent but I could so far fairly compare this to the way the weapons were in Hellgate: London.  As for the size of the actual database and possible combination of weapons, I'm sure their claims are accurate but I can only comment from a practical standpoint of what I've seen.  In addition to weapons you also get shields which can do various things such as regen health or do elemental bursts when depleted and grenade modifications which allow your grenades to do all kinds of things such as teleport, stick to things, and bounce.

Looting is probably one of my few mild gripes with this game.  You can't simply auto-loot everything in your proximity.  What the game has you doing is finding in item, hitting the loot button, and then holding it to pick up other relatively close items.  It's not game breaking annoying but the range on it isn't very great and holding the loot button to pick up a weapon will auto-equip it which is something that can be frustrating at times.

The graphics will most likely be a love/hate thing for most players as they are highly stylized.  I personally love them and think they're quite well done but there are certainly realism junkies out there that won't care for the cartoon approach at all.  I will say that only decent videos of this game should be used to judge the graphics, still screenshots don't do this game any justice at all.  Graphics aside the environments are very interesting, the characters are well done albeit a bit generic, enemies are pretty decent (Tremors anybody?), and the animations are high quality.

Multiplayer can be done with 2 player split screen couch co-op and online with up to four players I believe.  I haven't gone online yet but the split screen was easy enough.  Rather than scaling all of the menus down in split screen they opted to leave them full size and movable so that text wouldn't get smushed together which I thought was a pretty clever move.  What this means is both players don't have to squint to read everything thing, simply centralize it in their field of view.  Also as you do quests objectives/turn-ins will be shared meaning you don't spend your time waiting for everyone to catch up all the time.  In multiplayer you can also duel each other which I haven't tried yet.

Vehicles haven't really been much more than a way to get around for me yet.  They can be customized in color and weapon outfit but my brother and I both agreed that they weren't a very good way of killing anything aside from running them over which seemed to always been an automatic kill.  For a giant vehicle mounted weapon they seem completely inferior to even the worst weapon you could collect at that relative level.  The controls are very similar (identical?) to that of a Warthog in Halo.  They'll probably take some getting used to for new players but they're relatively easy once you've figured them out.  I personally find them to be a bit floaty and awkward but at the moment I don't see myself needing clutch control out of the vehicles for combat so they are passable.

The story regards something involving finding a long lost vault of alien technology.  While I'm sure it's interesting I honestly haven't paid much attention to it aside from parts of the story which I couldn't avoid.  This sort of game doesn't really bank on the story for me.

That's basically it.  Quest, kill, loot, level, and become the destructive juggernaut that Pandora always needed while searching for the vault.

Pros:
Great implementation of shooter mechanics
Lots of fun loot
Good multiplayer
Straight forward and simple RPG elements
Graphics

Cons:
Graphics
Wonky loot controls

After cleaning it up a bit with some alcohol and a q-tip it looks good as new except for the bottom, where you can see scratches from when it was used on a rougher desktop.  I thought buying refurbished meant that they would replace the outer shell of the mouse, but in this case you're getting a used mouse that had its internals fixed (apparently).  You'll need to install the Logitech Gaming Software suite from their website, which was a pretty painless process overall.  The mouse was already updated to the latest firmware and the gaming software suite gives you a lot of customization options.

I have big hands, and while this thing feels small at first it's definitely very wide.  I found the g-shift key to be a pain to begin with, but I switched my profile to the one where the thumb keys mimic the num-pad keys and then I changed the g-shift key to my auto-loot/push-to-talk key.  Ever since then I've really liked having my push to talk key not take up one of my keyboard fingers or my thumb when I'm in the middle of a big fight in-game.

This thing is also fairly light compared to my old mouse, the RAT 7, and it glides really easily over my hard 3M mouse mat.  Too easily, in fact.  It makes it really hard to select stuff when pressing a mouse button wants to slide the whole mouse around.  I'm getting a more grippy, softer mouse mat to see if that makes a difference and I'll update my review when it gets here.

Overall, I still feel like I got a pretty solid deal and I don't know that I would want to go back to regular mouse for my MMO gaming.

The Godfather game is different. Obviously it's been made on the back of the unparalleled success of Francis Ford Coppolla's gangster masterpiece. And it will sell for this reason as well. However, The Godfather game has it's own place in the epic narrative.

It would have been easy for EA to put the player in the shoes of Michael Corleone - the main protagonist in the movies. Indeed, it may have been due to the failure in securing a license to use Al Pacino's voice and likeness that forced EA's hand in creating a fresh perspective on the famous storyline. What we're left with is a new take featuring your good self; a narrative that sees you seamlessly weave in and out of events loyal to the film. For example, when Luca Brasi is stabbed through the hand and garrotted - at the start of the first movie - you look in on the event through a window, you're spotted and the scene turns into a revenge mission. It's expertly executed as you feel a part of a story that is genuine and loyal to film.

The violence has been superbly recreated also. The realistic nature of the firearms in The Godfather makes for interesting gameplay. As you might be used to the rather `cartoonish' gunplay of Saint's Row and GTA, The Godfather might at first seem unforgiving. And it is. But it's realistic - take one bullet from close range and you're sleeping with the fishes... it's as simple as that. Conversely your own guns carry the same clout, so shootouts often become intense and challenging affairs, if a little frustrating. Where as in GTA's gun fighting success is dependent on how quickly you can change targets and get your shots off, The Godfather sees you picking your shots and timing runs between cover. It's obvious that EA's development focussed heavily on the walking and shooting parts of the game, as this is where most of the appeal lies.

Driving however is a different affair altogether. Given the nature of The Godfather EA were limited on what is and isn't possible for the driving sections. The physics of the cars mean they are frustrating to play with. Most of the vehicles are slow and the faster cars seem unnaturally quick. The handbrake turns that work so well in GTA are irritatingly difficult to pull off, especially when being chased by the coppers. Cars bounce off kerbs but smash right through lampposts practically unaffected. Other vehicles, however, are seemingly made of concrete.

Also, getting from one way point to another can be at times be tedious - GTA gets round this by the superbly scripted radio stations, but The Godfather doesn't have such ingenuity - you're instead treated to a violin-based soundtrack that is depressing once the novelty has done a runner. The valid excuse is that most of this isn't EA's fault - this is more or less what it was like to drive a car in 'them days'. There was no radio; the cars were lame, classic, but moved like pair of concrete boots. Where the violence is so real, so must the rest of the game be if only for consistency.

As you would expect much of what you do is directed by the storyline. However there have been provisions for those who are more impulsive. Outside of the missions there are businesses to extort and rackets to take over. Doing as such will build your weekly wage, which you can then in turn spend on clobber and sorting your hair out. You have a respect bar that increases with each completed mission, but coolly this isn't the only way to gain kudos amongst fellow gangsters. Buying a nice wise guy suit brings in the plaudits and boosts the respect meter as much as whacking a guy. Each time your character levels up you get a point to allocate to his attributes. It's a bit of a weak RPG element, but worth thinking about when acquiring garments.

Extorting businesses is tricky, but worth the effort. You'll usually have to take out two or three 'bad guys' before being able to get to the owner. When you do the situation requires thought. Essentially you need to scare the businessman into paying, and you do so by finding his or her 'limit'. So while some owners will agree to 'protection' as soon as you ask, others will have to be battered to the brink of death. Pretty sick, but then the life of a gangster isn't for fairies. Be warned though, going over the top or killing the proprietor will render the business inactive for a while and you'll get nothing but a bruised set of knuckles. It's a fantastic sidetrack to the main game that has to be taken seriously if you want to hire muscle and buy more powerful weapons for later missions.

And so you've got two sections of the same game that sit paradoxically to each other. The superbly well balanced combat game play that forces you to be thoughtful and timely. And the very dodgy vehicle part that frustrates and bores more than anything else. It's difficult to review a sandbox game without making a comparison to GTA, although it's slightly unfair to do so with The Godfather given the rules imposed by the subject matter. At it's very best it delivers a gritty realism, but by the same realistic token, it can be at times terribly dull.

It is difficult to dislike The Godfather as EA have been so faithful to everything we loved about the films - but this is the undoing of the game also. It would have been forgivable to exaggerate the gameplay in places in order to make it more entertaining. But The Godfather is a game for the purists and in order to please it has to feel genuine, The Godfather certainly is.","""Respect the Game""",1163808000,3,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox'}",

4.0,False,"06 18, 2015",ACKE7RAMWLVP7,B00WTI2HV6,Brandon,"The game still needs work. If you read the reviews already, then you know how the gameplay is. It is very buggy in most cases. The fight mechanics are pretty bad. There is too much delay when I have to block or swing my sword. Most of time, it is frustrating going against the griffin or tough enemies. More likely, you have to use your potions. Other than that, the storyline is UNBELIEVABLE!  I can never put down the controller because the story and how everything is going grabs my attention very quickly. The environment is just fantastic to be in. So much effects in the game like raining, storm, etc. I am happy that the developers look into the effects of the outdoors.

Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption, and little bit Halo (music background) kind of fits into this game together, It is great that they made huge map where you can roam around and do quests just like Skyrim's open world. Red Dead Redemption kind of like fits in here because of the horse, Cantar is the term when you hold the 'A' button to let the horse run on the trail. More like, it is an autopilot feature but you don't sometimes, have to do that because they have a FAST TRAVEL feature in the game which is good because I don't feel like sometimes riding the horse all around the map. I think they have to fix the horse because it does not leap over fences. I thought horses do that stuff but not in this game, sadly. The music is great to hear while playing. It gives that warm vibe while riding your horse through the map and really like how it changes to that DARK sound when enemies are close by. Most of the games are now doing that which is awesome for me. Why I say Halo? Because of the music, it brings that feeling and that attention to move forward with the game or story.

The only things that needs work is the horse, fighting or combat mechanics, and needs more of that face expression. Most of these new games coming out are having great details of face movement. The Witcher 3 kind of like does not have that detail of getting mad or upset. There will be some moments when he will smirk or giggle by using his lip movement and cheek as well but other than that, it still looks great. Overall this game needs an update that fixes the issues. I really like this game and this is for people who likes to follow the story or roaming around the map to complete little missions. I have read some of the reviews that talked about not being like a witch. I sort of agree with that because most of time, you will be fighting with your sword or crossbow. Sometimes, you will forget that you had potions or other cast of spells to use. During the story, you kind of like being a detective to find leads or answers to find somebody or other type of objectives. When I first heard about the game, I thought there will be crazy magic stuff like lighting from the sky or anything that is relevant of being a witch, I guess not in this game. This was my first game of the series, and I don't think that I don't have to play the previous games just to keep up the story. I may be wrong for not playing the recent titles, but still kind of understand of how the story is going with the Witcher. I rented the game from Gamefly because somehow, it was available right of way. I was planning on getting it at least next month but I guess not. The reason I rented because it only has story mode and some side missions. I rather grab a copy from GameStop if the game had online mode. I hope you guys like my review. I tried my very best to give you guys my perspective of the game.

5.0,False,"01 5, 2008",A1OMF0PR78R392,B00004YUWA,Andrew Green,"If you ever find the opportunity to buy this game, you should certainly do so.  ICO provides a unique and unparalleled gameplay experience all wrapped up in a moody and atmospheric setting.

Here's basically how it works:  you play as a young, horned boy named Ico.  You've been banished from your home village and offered up as sacrifice, due to what is implied to be a curse of sorts.  But a stroke of luck gives you the perfect chance to escape.  On your way out, you find Yorda, trapped in a cage dangling several stories from the ground.  While you cannot communicate with her through words (both characters speak different non-existent languages), you still feel compelled to save this alluring young lady.

In order to achieve your escape, and that of Yorda, you must pull her around by her arm (or in some cases, call her to follow you) and guide her through puzzles and obstacles through environmental manipulation, while overcoming well-thought-out and clever platforming tasks to do this.  You must also use simple but fun combat techniques to keep the evil shadows from pulling poor Yorda into a dark portal, thus ending the game.

Sound boring?  Well, it's really not.  Read on!

While most games that require you to lug an extra character around tend to be bothersome and tedious, there is something so gratifying about tugging Yorda around the gloom-and-doom castle in which this one-of-a-kind fairy tale takes place.

With every intricate puzzle, you will have ""ah-ha!"" moments, and ""huh?"" moments, and sometimes you will even get ""wow!"" moments.  Few games have provoked so much response from me as a gamer, and anyone looking to connect emotionally with the on-screen character (or in this case, characters), would be a fool not to play this game.

Some gamers complain about the brevity of this adventure, but I am compelled to disagree:  the game is simplistic in nature.  If it were any longer, it might have seemed a bit...excess.  I won't say I wouldn't have appreciated more length to the game, but at the same time, when all was said and done and I was faced with the finale (which is, by the way, very fitting), I didn't feel cheated.  I felt like I had experienced something very special and now I was fortunate enough to go and tell others about it!

5.0,True,"02 27, 2012",A2HOEEATIMAZIA,B0050SW8OS,J. Star,"I always like to lay my personal personal prejudices out there in the beginning of reviews so that people know where I am coming from and if they can relate and might have the same opinion of a product. So, having said that, please know that I am an Uncharted fan. I am mainly a PC gamer. I didn't own any of the current gen consoles until Uncharted 2 was released. I saw so many previews and reviews, and from what I could tell the game was a modern take on Indiana Jones. I had to play it, so I actually bought a PS3 just to play Uncharted 2. I stopped two levels in and went out at midnight to buy the previous game so I could play through that first. Since then I have used my PS3 mostly to watch movies, until Uncharted 3 came out. I own the collector's edition of that game. I own all the soundtracks. Like I said, I am a fan.

So, when Uncharted: Golden Abyss was announced for the new PlayStation Vita system, I immediately pre-ordered the Vita and Uncharted. (Maybe someday something else will come out on the Vita that I want to play. Vita Uncharted 2, most likely.) I mean, two Uncharted games in less than a year? Sign me up!

Graphics: I am floored by how good this game looks. I am sure there are some technical cheats to make it run well, but you cannot tell on the Vita's brilliant 5"" OLED screen that this game looks any worse than any of the other Uncharted games. It looks fantastic. Some of the vistas from mountain side ledges are jaw dropping. The characters are all animated well, and they look like they do in the big screen versions of Uncharted.

Sound: The sound is good, considering it is not surround sound and is being generated by the Vita's tiny built in speakers. A good pair of headphones make the sound much more enjoyable, as the sound is much louder and clearer that way. The sound designer made good use of panning. You can almost hear things circling you, even though it is only stereo sound.

Nolan North is back as the voice of Nathan Drake, and Richard McGonagle returns as Sully. Obviously, both are top notch voice actors, but the new characters in the game are voiced competently as well. (If you are a video game fan, you'll pick out Steve Blum voicing mercenaries in the first 10 seconds.)

Gameplay: I've seen some complaints about gameplay. I have to wonder if these people have played an Uncharted game before. Yes, the touchscreen is new. Yes, you do have to use it for some things. But, for other things, you can completely ignore it if you like in favor of using the analog sticks and the buttons. Yes, it makes you tilt the Vita to the right and left a handful of times to keep Drake's balance on a log. That was also in Drake's Fortune using the PS3 controller. Yes, you have to rub the screen to do charcoal rubbings or clean off archeological finds. Those things happen quite often if you are looking for the hidden loot, otherwise there are only a handful of times where you have to do it in order to advance the game.

Yes, there is 3rd person, cover based shooting. It's an Uncharted game, that's how the combat is in all the other Uncharted games too. The difference here is that you swipe the touchscreen to do the quick-time finishing moves instead of hitting a button. You can touch the screen to melee attack people, but you can also just use the buttons until the finishing moves. Is there more or less combat than other Uncharted games? I don't think so. I found it pretty equitable to all the other games in the series. It's mostly about 3rd person combat, exploring, platforming, and a dash of puzzle solving.

I found the new interface elements to be fun and inventive. I really like using the touch screen to control parts of the game. Aiming is much easier if you use the analog stick to make major adjustments and then fine tune your aim by tilting the Vita left, right, up, and down.

Story: Just like other Uncharted games, the story is a riff on the classic Indiana Jones/pulp adventure style story. There's a girl in trouble, a shady friend, a loyal friend, a fabulous treasure and a host of bad guys trying to stop you from getting the treasure. I didn't find the story any better or worse than the other games in the series. If you really don't like this kind of story, I'm not sure why you would buy an Uncharted game in the first place. The dialogue may be just a tad bit blander than the other games in the series. This game does have a different writer, but the story was overseen by the writer of the other games. I chalked it up to Nate being younger than he is in the other games.

The game actually starts out fairly slow, and then builds to a frenetic ending. I found the pacing to be spot on, and the game is just long enough to make me feel like I got my money's worth, but not long enough to make me feel like they were dragging it out just to make it longer.

Music: The only Greg Edmonson track in the game is the Uncharted Theme song. The rest of the music was composed by another musician whose name flew by so fast in the credits that I couldn't spell it correctly if I wanted to. That's too bad, because I would love to give him credit. He did a great job of keeping the tone and feel of the Uncharted games, but with all his own pieces. Not only does the music give a great action adventure feel to the game, but some of the tracks are just fantastic, featuring booming native chants and creepy strings that made me feel like this extinct native tribe was waiting in the bushes ready to jump out and ambush Drake and friends. I'd buy the score if they ever made it available.

Overall: I was not disappointed in this game. Golden Abyss lived up the Uncharted name, and I feel the job that they did with this game justifies the extra cost of the cartridge. Sure, there's no real multiplayer to speak of (you can trade collectibles on the Vita's NEAR program), but I don't really buy Uncharted games for the multiplayer anyway. If you like the Uncharted games on the PS3, you'll probably like this too.",Nathan Drake goes portable.,1330300800,95,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Easy fatalities are for casuals who have trouble remembering 5-6 button inputs, which is extremely thoughtful for them to do imo. The $20.00 to unlock the entire krypt isn't impacting anyone since the only things you actually get are costumes, artwork, and music. The reason I didn't list fatalities and brutalities as unlockables, is because you don't need to purchase them to perform them. All you need to do is look them up online, perform then once, then it automatically becomes unlocked and is permanently shown when you go to your finishers input menu. And as for Goro, the reason I didn't mention him as DLC, was because he was originally a ""Pre order bonus"". We were told that for nearly 8 months now, and were even told if you didn't pre-order, he would then become DLC. Which explains the reason why he's ""already on the disk"", and also explains why certain people don't have him.

The final complaint I want to address is the only other one I've seen in these reviews. Which is the supposedly ""locked"" characters such as Sindel and Tanya. There's reasoning to this, although I can't blame people for being uneducated about it, as it was only discussed on NetherRealm's Twitch streams, and on social media from the creators. But simply put, those characters aren't yet finished, and some NEVER will be. Even for Tanya who's coming out in May, just because you fight against her once in story mode, doesn't mean she's finished. Especially considering she would still have two other variations that needed to be done as well. And as for Sindel and the other cameo's such as Kabal, we simply were NEVER promised they would be playable in game. And their only reasoning to be even included (whether in a cutscene, or fighting against) is simply to go along with the story, and give us a definitive understanding as to what happened to them from MK9.","Counter argument for the uneducated ""rants"" upon DLC and missing characters.

I played it pretty much every day after school, and it got to the point where I could blow through the whole thing in under twenty minutes, achieve the A+++ ranking upon completion, and only lose one or two blocks of health during the entire campaign. So why did I keep playing it, long after I had mastered it? The game was outrageously fun, that's why.

Dragon's Crown recaptures that type of fun for me perfectly. It's like Golden Axe, but with infinitely better graphics, sound, and most importantly: depth. Separating itself from the much older Golden Axe, your characters level in this game, they develop skills just like in any modern RPG, they acquire loot, and the techniques with which you combat the enemies continue to evolve as you become more experienced with how to play. Like Golden Axe, this game might seem like a mindless, button mashing brawler, but that's not true- for those who wish to develop their technique, this is a game that has oodles of depth and begs to be mastered by the devoted player. And, needless to say, nobody will be blowing through this game in twenty minutes - it's a lengthy, fascinating campaign.

Also noteworthy is the variety available in the character class selection, which will add tons of replay value for people like me who love to play these types of games. I'm currently using the Amazon, who is awesome, but I look forward to developing an enormously powerful wizard, and experimenting with the other classes as well. Like Golden Axe, this game is FUN - it's just that simple. I don't know if younger players who have been raised on different genres will enjoy it, but for anybody who was a fan of brawlers and beat `em ups, Dragon's Crown is a dream come true.","Fans of Golden Axe, rejoice!",1375747200,17,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

then there's the stuff about the patches. for someone who isn't savvy like that using computers, i found it all very confusing. the game definitely has glitches. in the one i bought, the worst glitch is that whenever the character frenzies, or when you use the protean discipline with the gangrel character, the screen goes all white and you can't see anything. i have to believe this is a mistake and that the game makers didn't do this on purpose.

Maybe it's because rhythm games are too specific for the masses, but it might also be because the packaging hides the fact that this is TWO games: Space Channel 5 parts 1 and 2.
Space Channel 5 part 1 is pretty much an exact port from the Dreamcast version a few years back. Space reporter Ulala defeats aliens in an elaborate dance-off with guns, featuring the ""Parappa-style"" call-response control. It's a great game that still stands well, but it's a bit dated nowadays, and very short.
Space Channel 5 Pt. 2 improves on the graphics, controls and storyline, but the style and gameplay are the same (the ""don't mess with a good thing"" philosophy). The game itself is noticeably longer, as well.
However, The bells and whistles are really what sets this apart from its predecessor. SC5:2 features a two-player mode, a ""dance off"" minigame, musical instrument minigames, and unlockable characters and toys. You'd be getting your money's worth with Part 2 alone, but Part 1 is a nice bonus.
A notable feature about both games is that they're more about timing than Parappa's button-mashing combos, so you can hook up a Dance Dance revolution mat. Imagine, a DDR game with an actual PLOT!
I feel for the rhythm genre. It speaks to a different kind of mindset than the average gamer, and is often reviewed badly by gaming mags who have more interest in shooters and RPGs. Rhythm games get bad press and poor sales, scaring away developers.

This game is for football lovers, not guys you like to score a million points a game.  But the guys who like to study the plays and read defenses and offenses, this is a gaming dream come true.

Some of the great features provided:

1.  The franchise option.  Wow can I say that for all you fantasy football lovers out there that truly dream about running your own team and picking your players.  This is an awesome function that can create years of fun.  One thing that would be awesome is to provide a way to transfer an existing franchise to the newer versions of the game.

2.  The DEFENSE.  The defense is absolutely incredible.  Some people have been a little critical of some of the options like the hit stick.  But the hit stick is a realistic option.  Lining up someone for a knock out blow is difficult and leaves you hanging out there if you miss.  Well the game is no different; if you learn when the hit stick is appropriate it can lead to bone crushing hits that make you cringe.  Not only does the hit stick/playmaker option make for a better defense, but also the control you have over your defense is incredible.  Calling a defensive audible is not where this ends.  Calling a coverage audible and linebacker/line shifts provide those with the eye for football to dominate.

Now these are just a few of the Pros listed above, and I will be fair by giving the one big con that I can think of.

1.  The graphics, yes the graphics are a little sketchy but EA games decides that speed of play and quality of play is more important.  Now the importance you place on graphics is really up to you.  I really don't mind the sketchier graphics when the game play is so much better.  The comparisons made to ESPN NFL 2K5 are fairly accurate.

A lot like Wii Sports in the graphics, sound and overall feel. The graphics are better, and more fun the the original. You'll hear the same voices, you'll get points to get to Pro level, and your other Mii's will show up in the background, just like in the original.  You get basic games, as well as unlocking alternate versions of the games.  For example, after you play bowling, you'll unlock 100 pin bowling.  Other fun extras include being able to choose from a few different golf courses.

I was disappointed at first to see bowling and golf, why repeat those games? Once you play it with the new motion control, you'll see why. I'll never play Wii Sport golf again. It's so much more responsive, especially in putting. Same with bowling, making it a MUCH more challenging game!! I think people will love the updated versions.

I honestly thought the Motion control was just a new marketing trick to sell more accessories, but it truly does make a difference.  If you've ever played Wii Play table tennis, it pales in comparison to the Wii Sports version.  It's much more fun, it's much more accurate in movement.  The motion control detects not only left to right, top to bottom, but inward and outward.  Giving it a more realistic feel.

I've also played a lot with the sword play games, archery, frisbee, table tennis, and wakeboard.  All very fun! I played for over an hour, and only played half the games.  I think it has some good replay value. Not something you'll get tired of in a month. I already can't wait to get back to it!

My only complaint so far is basketball, a game that I'm terrible at in real life. That tells you just how accurate this new motion control is! haha  With some practice it will be a lot of fun too, I'm sure.  As with any game, there will games you enjoy less then others, but with so many to pick from, it's sure to please a variety of Wii fans.

You'll certainly have to retrain yourself in the way you play Wii, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be addicted!

You also learn several mind skills, not powers, but necessary exercises to prepare you for the coming hazards in the next challenge.

There is not much to say about the game. You have a colorful cast of characters and you can unlock more either through paid downloads or through achieving certain points in the game. Each race circuit is fantastic and they cover most of the best selling brands from Sega. New and young gamers will be able to easily recognize Sonic and friends, but will have a hard time recognizing Ulala, Nights or House of the Dead, which are from games from older generations.

The best aspect of this game is that since the karts transform in boats and planes, the game has higher degree of complexity, but stil manages to remain accesible.

The characters level by earning experience points that are collected from each win on the game, and this unlocks customization options on how the kart handles. For example, you can select a setting for improved speed but less maneuverability. This adds a lot of replay value.

It has online multiplayer as well as local multiplayer. It works with Xbox 360 controllers.

This is a magnificent family game that any video game fan can enjoy fully. I highly recommend it, specially if you can get it during  a special sale.

Oh, and one last detail. There are not many ""kart"" games for computer these days, which makes this a very special game. I know we all wanted a Mario one, but this fits the bill perfectly.","One of the best ""kart"" games in the market",1388707200,,,

After completing this game, I felt an immense epiphany; it is as if I have just finished viewing an epic onscreen. The story itself is epic. Following the grand tradition of movie sequels, this one picks up right after the first game. As Desmond Miles, you find yourself captive in a research facility run by modern day Templars. This time round, one finds himself transported back to the Renaissance era in 15th century Italy.

The sandbox world itself requires many moments of just gazing at its beauty. The various synchronisation points offer the gamer a kaleidoscopic view of the various Italian cities. The views are simply breathtaking and spectacular. Venice deserves special mention. The scope of the city is really immense.

Ezio Auditore, the protagonist, is a likeable rouge. More so than Altair. He starts off as somewhat a rich playboy but progressed into a master assassin through extraordinary circumstances. I like the fact that historical characters and even architecture features figures largely in the game. It's a joy interacting with Leonardo Da Vinci, Il Magnifico, Rodrigo Borgia (Pope Alexander IV), even the dastardly Machiavelli makes a cameo appearance!

This review is in regards to the PS3 version. I must say that I'm a bit disappointed with the quality. As [...] pointed out, there were a few visual glitches. Throughout the course of my gameplay, the game crashed thrice. Twice at the same spot, with me performing the same action - double assassination 4 guards in succession.

5.0,True,"04 21, 2015",A1E8EXMWOA7RT7,B005YR308S,Piaw Na,"It's a good thing I picked up and played Heavy Rain after The Wolf Among Us and The Walking Dead. It makes those two games look sad by comparison.

These games fall into the category of ""choose-your-own-adventure"". The puzzles provided per-se aren't particularly challenging, so what I evaluate these games on is the deepness and richness of the content: how often are the decisions meaningful? How many different ways can the story end? Does the story provide emotional impact? Is the story coherent?

By those standards Heavy Rain is outstanding. In fact, if you own a PS3, just stop reading, find yourself a copy, and play!

Still with me? OK. Heavy Rain is a story about parenthood. It starts with Ethan Mars' interaction with his family, and a defining incident in which he fails to save his son from a traffic collision. Years later, we find him depressed and subject to occasional blackouts. During one of those blackouts, his second son disappears, kidnapped by the ""origami killer"", a serial killer who focuses on killing children. The rest of the game follows Ethan's attempt to rescue his son and uncover who the origami killer is.

There are 3 other playable characters: Madison Paige, a reporter, Scott Shelby, a private detective also investigating the case, and Jayden, the FBI agent assigned to the case. The viewpoint of the game shifts between these playable characters, and you see them cross-paths, or even watch one storyline uncover clues while another storyline is oblivious.

The script is exceedingly well written. The characters are believable, and their interaction choices don't leave me frustrated. Furthermore, when the reveal happens, not only was I surprised, when I thought back to all the clues previously provided I felt that the mystery was fair: I had enough clues to figure out who the killer was, but the misdirection and setup had distracted me enough that I didn't put them together. This is exceedingly hard to do, and Heavy Rain succeeds.

What's even more amazing is the game play. In The Walking Dead or The Wolf Among Us, if you fail at one of the ""game"" section, the game restarts at a checkpoint and then you play it over until you succeed. Heavy Rain throws away such conceits. If you fail at one point, your viewpoint character can die but the game carries on! The story changes, and you can get a different ending. I'm not a great game player, so by the time I finished the game two of my characters have died, and poor Ethan Mars was a mess of injuries. But the ending still satisfied me and didn't leave me feeling as though I was cheated of storyline that I should have observed but didn't.

What's more, the game did a fantastic job making me feel what the characters were going through. Because lives were at stake and because I could fail, the story was intense. At several points I winced as the killer put Ethan Mars through trials to see how far a father would go to save his son. Whenever I failed one of those trials, I felt devastated. Some of those scenes had me shaking while pushing buttons on the controller, events that never happened in other games.

When I bought the game, I thought I'd sell it when I'd finished. Now that I'm done, I realize that like a good movie, it's a game I wouldn't mind playing again, especially since you can get different endings. (If you want to shorten the time it takes to watch all the different endings, you should save frequently so you can try both success and failure scenarios --- I wasn't aware of this feature until it was too late) I liked this game enough that I'll probably hunt down Quantic Dream's other games in the future.

What are the nits in the game? The controls are a little painful: sometimes you have to hold down multiple buttons and then shake the controller in order to get certain things to happen. If your controller is broken in that the six-axis sensor is inconsistent this can drive you nuts. This game definitely depends on a low latency screen as well. My plasma screen even in game mode made this game harder because of the induced latency. Being a PS3 game, the graphics are fantastic for that era but of course cannot compare to the PS4. I'm looking forward to Quantic Dream's future games on the PS4. Finally, the adult situations and nudity means that this game is unsuitable for pre-teens.

But despite these faults, I'd say that this game is exhibit A in why a dedicated home console (especially Sony's) makes sense. You can't get games of this quality on any other platform, and it's clear that Quantic Dream's efforts are of a level of maturity, sophistication, and emotional impact that makes other efforts on competing platforms look like they're multiple decades behind. Highly recommended!","A level of maturity, sophistication, and impact that make other efforts look like they're multiple decades behind",1429574400,7,,
5.0,False,"09 11, 2012",A1X4JO8EJ1U5BR,B00000F1GM,Mike London,"It's strange to me that in all the years since ""Super Mario 64"" was released in 1996, I never wrote  a review for this groundbreaking, utterly fantastic game that has meant so much to me over the years.

To give just a little history, when the N64 came out, I had some family who were in the middle of a divorce after an ugly affair in 1994 with a pastor of a church we all went too.  My friend, (who we will call Courty) who was born in 1987 and who I consider as close as a brother, was just a young kid and going through the hell of his family disintegrating.  His father was dysfunctional and drank a lot and his mother was an adulterer.  His mother and my mother grew up together and known each other since grade school.  His brother and my brother were best friends, being the same age.  And although there was a seven year difference between himself and I, we were super close (and still are), because of how close our families were (and still are).  I remember turning 17 in January of 1997, and my family had a big birthday party and I got my very own N64 and a copy of this game.

Those were brutally hard times for all involved with so much pain.  The parents divorced and the dad got his own house.  In the midst of that, the boy's dad bought him an N64, along with ""Super Mario 64"" and ""Star Wars, Shadows of the Empire"".  For me, this game is forever tied up into that emotionally turbelent period in our lives, because both my friend and myself would play this for hours and hours just to escape the hollowness and the pain we both felt at what was going on around us.  That, my friends, is the power of Super Mario.

Anyway, I grew up in the NES and SNES era.  Context is so important, because without the context of growing up in those years, the impact of ""Super Mario 64"" is completely lost to younger people.  To the generation that has ""The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"", ""Gears of War"", the ""Grand Theft Auto"" series, the ""Mass Effect"" trilogy, ""Assasin's Creed"", ""Metroid Prime"" trilogy,  and the ""Call of Duty"" series, playing through ""Super Mario 64"" now may feel like you're going backwards, and you'd be right.

The best analogy for those who didn't grow up during that time would be like watching a black and white television from the 1950s or 1960s, and then within a mere ten years, you are now watching a Plasma TV capable of 3D technology.  Or the 1939 movie ""The Wizard of Oz"", when Dorothy opens the door and everything goes from black and white to glorious colour.  ""Super Mario 64"" was THAT much of a gamechanger.

I've been with Super Mario since day one all the way back in 1985.  There is not a single ""Super Mario"" game that I have missed out playing at launch, with only two exceptions, ""Super Mario Land"" for the Gameboy and ""Super Mario Sunshine"" for the Gamecube.  Each Mario game was a revelation and just utterly fun back in that era, even though they were short.  My first exposure to ""Super Mario 64"" was sometime in the fall of 1996.  I just remember being in utter amazement - remember, though there may have been some 3D forays before ""Super Mario 64"", nothing, and I mean NOTHING, looked this amazing or played this awesome.  I would play the game for hours and hours, and felt like I was in a fully interactive novel or world.  I can remember thinking ""Where do game makers go from here?  This is utter perfection!""  I niavely thought the graphics would never be equaled, they were that good.  I remember telling Courty's brother (my own brother's best friend) back in the late 1980s ""Wow, just imagine if they go past 16 bit and go to like 80 bit or 100 bit!  Just think how amazing that would be!""  And with the 64 Bit, I felt that what I had been talking about had come to past.

For those who didn't grow up back then, it can be easily to forget just revolutionary ""Super Mario 64"" truly was.  Just eleven years prior to the 1996 induction of ""Super Mario 64"" to popular consciousness, we were playing such early titles as the original ""Super Mario Bros."" (the best launch game for the NES hands down), ""Excitebike"", the absolutely dreadful ""Ten  Yard Fight"", etc.  From 1985 to 1994 we saw some of the greatest games ever made in glorius 8-Bit, but especially the early NES titles are so far removed from current gaming that there will be those out there who find them hard to play.  Look at some of the old NES ads on Youtube or game magazines from the 1980s and 1990s.

But technology moves on, and the SNES and Sega Genesis were fighting for dominance in the early 1990s.  Once we graduated to the SNES and the Genesis, gamers moved beyond mere platforming to more expansive types of games such as the ""Final Fantasy"" titles, ""Act Raiser"", ""Sim City"", ""Super Metroid"", ""Chrono Trigger"", and ""The Legend of Zelda: A Link tot he Past"".  Either that or we were all playing Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter II clones.  By 1995 we saw Nintendo push the SNES to its limits technologically with such titles as ""Star Fox"" and the ""Donkey Kong Country"" trilogy, as well as ""Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island"".

The plot is simple.  Bowser kidnapped Princess PEACH Toadstool (the first time she was ever referred to as ""Peach"" in North America) after the Princess invited you over for some cake.  It is up to you as Mario to go forth and rescue Power Stars that are hidden throughout the castle.  Enough about the plot.  Let's get to the gameplay.

And the gameplay, oh the gameplay!  You are in a fully interactive 3D environment.  After turning the N64 on and getting a file set up (after spending entirely too much time messing with Mario's face at the starting screen - don't worry, we all did that!), Mario jumps out of a pipe, and you are in a field with a castle ahead of you.  You can jump, swim, scoot, crawl, kick, punch, wall-jump.  Yo  can do a backflip even and a triple jump and a long jump.  The game is so vibrant, colorful, and, at least back in the late 1990s, simply a beauty to behold.

You go to the castle, and after you are introduced to your friendly camera man (who everyone now very fashionably hates on), the Lakitu (in a rare state of not throwing Spinies at you), you are free to go where ever you wish, provided you have enough stars.  The castle is the overall hub, and by jumping into different portraits on walls, pools, down tunnels, and even looking into the sunlight in the castle will open you to one of the game's fifteen overall levels or a secret level.  Nintendo wisely made certain parts of the castle inaccessible until you have gained enough power stars, but these goals are quite easy to meet.

There is simply so much to do and so much to see, whether you are fighting King Bob-Omb and the Bob-Omb Battle Field, raising with Koopa the Quick, and navigating the snowy terrains of ""Cool, Cool Mountain"" and ""Snow Man's Land"".

The levels are just so memorable.  Mario controls the water levels present in ""Wet Dry World"".  ""Dire Dire Docks"" has an enormous sub and a cool stingray.  ""Tall, Tall Mountain"" pits you against a theiving monkey.  ""Shifting Sand Land"" features a great battle against a pair of hands called Eye Rok, a cranky vulture who will steal your cap, and a great pyramid.  ""Letha Lava Land"", a level literally likened to hell, has a volcano and a sea of lava that Mario must contend with.  The last two levels are particularly fiendish: ""Tick Tock Clock"" is an enormous clock level that speeds up or slows down depending on what time the clock reads when you enter the level, and ""Rainbow Ride"" (always my personal favorite) is probably the most difficult, with an expansive sky level where Mario gets to ride magic carps riding on enormous rainbows.

Then there's ""Whomp's Fortress"" (which was remade into a retro stage for ""Super Mario Galaxy 2""), always fun, ""Jolly Roger Bay"" (a nautically themed, very creepy level with a scary eel and an enormous pirate ship; it was always my least favorite), a haunted mansion ""Big Boo's Haunt"", and a level of either epic or bite size preportions, ""Tiny-Huge Isaldn"".  Each level brings new and fun ways to interact with the environment hithertoo unseen previously in other levels.

There are all three secret cap levels that are a lot of sun as well, including flying.  ""Super Mario Bros. 3"" may be the first time Mario flew, but it was ""Super Mario 64"" that Mario really took to flight like never before.  Also the Princess's Secret Slide is a lot of sun fun, and houses the most obscure star of them all (you must beat the slide under 21 seconds, and the most surefire way to do that is actually jump off the slide and land down much farhter)

One thing that I really love about ""Super Mario 64"", and which the other 3D Marios have not included, is how open ended the title is.  You can really go anywhere and are not limited to individual stars.  As great as the Galaxy games are (and believe me, they're fantastic, especially the second), they don't have the open ended exploration of SM64 and are more linear and streamlined.

The closest akin to the exploration factor is ""Super Mario Sunshine"" (a game I have tried and simply cannot get into).  However, whereas you are limited to whatever star you choose in ""Super Mario Sunshine"" (and this fact alone makes for some tedious gameplay in that title), in ""Super Mario 64"" has all six stars available (with only one or two exceptions) from the get go, giving you much more freedom to do whatever you want.  Streamlining is important, and when Nintendo removed the abilitiy to get any star you want at the onset of the level, they ended up with the somewhat confusing and tedious levels of ""SMS"".  It's a very fine line between streamlined and open ended, but SM64 has that balance spot on.

Going back now, yes, even though back then I didn't think it was possible back in 1996 when I first played this, we moved far beyond this game graphically.  The polygons look dated, and the camera has gotten a notorious repution, with IGN even calling the camera system ""broken"" by today's standards.  And yes, subsequent titles may have perfected the 3D gameplay, but really, it was Mario that led the charge, and even today the game holds up well.  Now I play ""Super Mario 64"" with my own kids who love it too.

This game has meant so much to me and got me and my brother (he may as well be) through some very rough times.  Add And for that I will always be thankful.  One of the best games out there, without a doubt!",The Power of Super Mario 64 helped my friend and I cope with divorce,1347321600,4,,

I actually thought NCAA 07 was a better game than Madden 07, even though I am not into college football.

This year I was definitely up for playing 08.  After reading a review in EGM, I took the advice of the writers and decided to pick up the XBOX 360 version.  It played very nicely and I was excited about the new enhancements, specifically to the Dynasty mode.  When recruiting players you now have a much more expansive option of convincing them to attend your school.  It seems that the developers really worked on improving this area.  The gameplay has also been improved and is much smoother than the previous year.

However, two weeks into the game my 360 broke down and while waiting for it to get repaired I picked up the PS3 version.  There was a noticeable difference right away.  I could see that the PS3 version was not as smooth.  I believe that the frames per second on the PS3 version are about half that of the 360.  Other than that I have not noticed any differences between the two version.

If you only own a PS3, it's not worth the extra money to buy a 360 for this game, but there is a noticeable difference in animation between the two.  The one nice feature I recently discovered on the PS3 version is the ability to move your controller (SIXAXIS) to perform certain in game moves like: fake huddle, big hit, etc.  You basically lift up the controller or push it forward to activate these moves.  It adds a nice touch.",Great Game ... But Better on 360 Than PS3,1192233600,5,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

5.0,False,"11 3, 2010",A1ITCVZ46MUB3A,B0045ZIENQ,Rise of the Tomb Whizzer,"I have had a great deal of difficulty getting into any given game recently, and it has often taken some pretty impressive games for me to put in more than a couple of hours. I started by getting the original Dragon Age: Origins preowned, and within a week, I knew that I would be purchasing this copy. It simply offers too much downloadable content and expansions at too great a value to pass up. I will rate the game as a whole, for those of you who don't know about Dragon Age.

Graphics: I have often heard people speak ill of the graphics of Dragon Age. I suppose the graphics are only slightly better than that of Xbox 360 games that came out on release day, but definitely not as poor as PS2 graphics that some people claim it sports.
Considering what they have done with the game, I can't say I would complain about the graphics. Every single piece of armor shows on every character on every cut scene. Cut scenes change based on what you have done and who is in your party, and every dialogue piece changes depending on who is in your party. It is remarkable to see little details such as what boots a character is wearing showing accurately in every scene. I consider this to be an impressive game. And it may not be FF 13 graphics, but it does some far more impressive things than FF13 ever attempted.

Glitches: Yes the game consists of glitches, are any of them game breaking? I haven't run into any as I had with Fallout 3. The glitches are sometimes audio fails to properly trigger, some characters outfits or beards tend to fall into each other, there was one scene where my character performed the killing blow on thin air because the monster had already fallen, so glitches exist, and they can be distracting. Once again, I point to the shear magnitude that this game accomplishes, and can forgive that some dialogue doesn't match up right, or a codex is inaccurate, given how much the game possesses. Compared to shorter games like Gears of War, Halo, and Darksiders, the game has considerably more glitches, and you will run across them. However, other than being minor inconveniences, I haven't experienced anything. Just follow the rule of save frequently, especially since the games autosave feature isn't quite as frequent as you would probably prefer.

Environment: This might be some of the reason people hit so badly on the graphics. The environments are pretty bland. You aren't going to see very much in the ways of surreal, artistic, landscape. Once in a while you might see something pretty cool, like in the deeproads, but for the most part, I have found the landscape to be relatively bland.

Appropriateness: Most people are curious about the content. A lot of games are labeled M for mature, but that can go in a lot of directions. In general, there is no swearing in the game, the characters rather using the softer words like ""Sodding"" when they swear. With regards to nudity, there are various enemies that will be fairly bare. Desire Demons typically where nothing but a loin cloth and some ""nipple covers"". A certain monster shows more boobs, but there was nothing sexual about a broodmother. You can have sex in the game, but it is done fairly tactfully, and every character wears underwear, the loose, unexposing kind. Homosexuality, threesomes, foursomes, and more stuff can occur in this game as well. With regard to violence, the game revels in how it shows blood. Your characters will become covered in blood after fights, and certain items have the unique ability to be ""messy"" and have more blood. Enemies will have pools of blood around them too, and will quickly decay into skeletons after a kill. So violence is a yes, although you can't just attack and kill anyone like in oblivion... in this game you would have to challenge and threaten to get into fights, and even then it doesn't always work. So yes, a violent, sexual game with surprisingly decent language. The environments are typically OK, I didn't see too many scary environments or inappropriateness like in Fallout 3. In one or two areas, you might see a few people hanged from hooks, but nothing like Fallout 3 does. There was one area that freaked me out and was scary, but that was the only area in the game I found to be that way.

Difficulty: I found the game to be pretty easy, but I suppose that depends on your experience with RPGs in general. I play on normal mode and might crank it up for my second playthrough. There were some challenges, but the more I play and get used to the controls, the easier it gets.

Variety: The game offers a fair variety of gameplay. Most of the time, it is simply clicking A to kill all your enemies, but there are plenty of ways to shake things up. If you are a mage, you will need to balance and run through your spells constantly. You can lure enemies into carefully constructed traps if you would like, causing them to fail miserably as they charge you. A boss or two require unique strategies to kill. So if you want to just hit A until it is dead, you can, or you can use your abilities strategically, the choice is yours.

Other characters:
You have the ability to fully control any member of your party, so don't think you are going to be helpless like in some other games. You can create fairly complex AI controls so that your ally acts exactly how you want him to. Learning to set these up properly is essential to the game. The redial menu is your friend, and while I originally tried to get away without it, I eventual realized it is a necessary part of the game. You will quickly learn that you can't learn everything, so you are going to have to give some of the slack to your allies. One of them will need to learn herbalism/trapmaking/lockpicking ect... you can't depend on the warden to master them all, making teamwork in your party essential, something I have not felt in any game for a while.

Improvements: My only two improvements that I think would have added greatly with the game is 1) allowing a second player to take control of one of the allies, which would have been remarkably easy to set up and 2) Perhaps a few less glitches would have been nice.

Overall: Other than that, I found this game to be the best game I have played in some time. It is fun, giving you an open game feel without the ""I have no idea where to go, what to do"" feel oblivion sometimes gave. Most of your paths are linear, and I can't say I felt like I missed too much without a strategy guide, but it still gives you options and multiple paths in any given dungeon/city. The additions were all great, and I enjoy awakening just as much. The addons are definitely fun and worth adding on, although I don't expect many of them are worth it to buy individually, they are a great deal within this edition.",One of the Greatest Games I have Played in long time,1288742400,57,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

5.0,False,"06 13, 2012",AMGGZCWY3VNZC,B000KRXA28,S. Morales,"Hotel Dusk Room 215 has been in release for a few years, and though it has never had heavy mainstream popularity, a very large and growing number of hardcore and more adult/mature gamers have found this gem and come to greatly appreciate its complete ingenuity and completely unique structure. Hotel Dusk is a Nintendo DS game that uses the DS capabilities to an incredibly long range, just short of the microphone. From what I hear, it has a similar structure to Trace Memory, another DS game that is very far from the typical action/shooter/platformer we have regularly seen from this system. No, Hotel Dusk is a completely story-driven game, working almost like an interactive novel, and sure to completely grip novel mystery/thriller/suspense readers as well as more open-minded non-readers. So no, even though the game is about 80% dialogue, it is not something that will immediately turn off someone who regularly plays action games. Although, I wouldn't see most gamers under the age of, let's say, 16 giving this as much thought.

Ok, onto the review. Hotel Dusk takes place in Los Angeles in 1979, and tells a story of a man named Kyle Hyde, an off-beat private detective and former NYPD police officer who now works for a sales company. Granted, his personality is very non-salesman like, he is sent to a small and rugged hotel in the middle of a rural area entitled Hotel Dusk. He is sent there to because a client asks him to locate some items left at the hotel. Kyle though reluctant, heads off and from there on he begins to have his own agenda in trying to unravel a mystery about his former partner who he had to actually shoot dead due to a bad circumstance. Kyle now believes his partner is alive, and his whereabouts have some big connection to the hotel.

Once there, you will meet a various cast of characters, each with their own unique personalities and with their own business at the hotel. Although in the beginning the characters dont' necessarily catch your eye, over the span of about the first hour of game time, you will become somewhat intrigued by the events that unfold. The game consisting of 10 chapters (or more like 10 levels), you become more and more interested, and even charmed by the cast the further you play in. I would say about Chapter 3 is where you tell yourself that you simply do not want to put this one down. It plays out like a really good book, and this one is a page-turner, one you won't want to let go of. After meeting and talking to many of these people Kyle begins to make connections to his mission and how much deeper he has to go to find out the truth behind not only his former partner, but what everybody at the hotel is really up to, the secrets they hold, etc. You need to find out who you can really trust, how to respond to their questions and what are the best ways to go about ""talking"" to them. This concept is greatly (although not perfectly) incorporated into the gameplay.

Hotel Dusk is a game that primarily uses the stylus, and really doesn't use the buttons for any reason other than to tap when having to scroll through more dialogue. The DS system is turned sideways, so the game plays like a book, and you use the style to do pretty much everything in the game. This includes, guiding Kyle as to where to talk (one screen showing his first-person prospective and the other you use as the map in order to guide Kyle throught the hotel). There are icons at the bottom of the screen in which you tap in order to perform certain tasks, such as going to your notebook, reviewing items, conversation summaries, but mostly to investigate certain spots in every room in which you'll tap on various objects for Kyle to investigate further - everything from cans, to pictures, to chairs, to notes and books. Investigating is the most important aspect of the game, and throughout the game you'll be put in little mini-games in which you will use the stylus to perform a task in order to further your investigation. For example, you rub it to use a nail file, to search through a garbage can, or even to write notes in your notebook for future reference.
Now when it comes to people's conversations, there are certain segments where Kyle must ask questions that are pertinent to his investigation. You will tap on these questions depending on who you're talking to, and get further information to the story as a whole. At some points Kyle will be given the option to choose 1 of 2 different things to say, and almost like a 'choose your own destiny' book, you must tap on the correct line or question in order to avoid ""losing"" the game. Once you get to know various characters, you will get a feeling as to how to approach certain questions and which of the 2 choices to ask, because doing the wrong thing will scare of turn the person away, or have you kicked out of the hotel completely, thus the game ends and you need to start again from the last checkpoint.

The game's puzzles and various choices are not based on the same sort of usual ""gaming logic"" that the vast majority of games have. Logic such as ""get armor key for armor lock"" or ""put the same colors together"" etc. No, this uses a VERY real world form of logic, and very real world forms of common sense, almost like what you would normally do if you were in the same exact situation. For example, at one point a character is upset because the hotel manager had to go through her things, and she says to be careful and Kyle tells himself that he better not be caught with certain items he's holding. Logic would state to IMMEDIATELY go back to your room and stash the items away so that you won't be caught with them. Me being a regular gamer, simply went ahead with these items anyway and was caught and questioned by the hotel manager. Since some of the items I was carrying were taken from the manger's own office (which I needed to investigate previously), he got angry and tossed me out of the hotel. Thus is lost the game and had to restart. This is the type of logic I mean. Anyway, as you go further you become more accustomed to this system and at the same time grow so fond of the story you simply DON'T want it to end! I can honestly say I was very upset when the game was over (although i did like the ending), and immediately had to buy the sequel to the game ('Last Window Secret of Cape West' which is sadly only in release in the UK and Japan, since Cing, the company that made this game, filed for bankruptcy, so the chances of this sequel coming to American shores may be slim to none).

Anyway, with this innovative system of gaming, one becomes incredibly intrigued by the story and like I said before, does not want to put it down. Now, lots of reviews I've seen complain that the game can get too dialogue heavy. I would ignore such reviews, as the game is mostly dialogue, but the vast majority of it is necessary. Only on about 2 instances (each taking about like 3 minutes) did I find the dialogue a little bit redundant. Almost like a writer who writes a great novel but has those 2 or 3 parts in there that could have been cut out. Big deal. These parts weren't terrible, but just sort of unnecessary.
But one minus I will say (and it's not really a minus per se), is that much of the game's puzzles can sort of leave you feeling clueless, and you may end up wandering all over the place with seemingly no clue as to what to do next. This is mostly due to the fact that you need to use an item you retrieved last chapter (and may have forgotten about), and need to use it on an object which you may have investigated hours ago and never really thought to go back to. This simply means that sometimes it's hard to put two and two together in this game, so you may have to resort to an online game guide. I had to do this several times because I found myself lost and without the common sense or patience to try and figure things out on my own. I did this because I really wanted to further the story which was way more intriguing than some of the puzzles. There are lots of items I didn't even end up using and clues around the hotel that were never necessary, which can sort of confuse to player even more depending on who you are.

Other aspects of the game, such as the soundtrack, stand out greatly. The soundtrack to this one feels more like a mix-up of elevator music, but one that has tunes set to a more old-world style, set to relax the player and not get in the way of the gameplay. It meshes beautifully, and you may find yourself checking up these on Youtube or simply wandering certain areas to hear the great music go on and on. I for one loved the music, and look forward to other tunes the sequel will bring.
The animation of this game is also brilliant. There is no audible dialogue, as this plays out more like a novel, but characters are pencil drawn in a old Noir style and move and express themselves through various frames and not smooth cartoon animations. It brings a great sense of coolness and charm to the game that can't really be cxplained unless you play it.

But this aside, any gamer looking to take a break from the usual shooting things, blowing stuff up, or going off to various fantasy realms and wants something with a fantastic involving story, a GREAT soundtrack, and incredibly unique gameplay won't make a mistake by picking this title up. Given its price now it's a very affordable and very enjoyable sleeper hit.","A Masterpiece, Perhaps the Best Game I've Played This Year",1339545600,,,

It looks and feels pretty much just the same as a standard Sony controller, but the wireless performance is fantastic, and It's still on the first set of batteries that I put in it about 4 months ago- even with an average of about 3-6 hours of gaming for about 5 days a week. It should be noted that I turn the vibration function off, which supposedly makes the batteries last MUCH longer. So far this seems to be true. The controller goes into sleep mode if you go 5 or 10 minutes without pressing anything so batteries are conserved that way as well.

The performance is outstanding. In our room, the PS2 system is fully blocked from plain view by a large bedpost, and therefore the wireless receiver is blocked along with it. Yet this controller still works, with no stalling whatsoever, even though it's blocked by a solid object (and even if I don't point the controller anywhere near the receiver). In fact, the controller has passed the ultimate test I could give it. My girlfriend often sleeps while I stay awake at night to play the PS2. The buttons are a bit clicky, so to not wake her up I've folded a blanket on top of me to muffle the sound. Yet the controller still works perfectly as well as a connected one. Under a thickly wadded blanket, from ten feet away, with an object in front of the receiver. The controller STILL works. I just have to make sure the receiver senses the controller at first, and then I'm free to move around with no problems at all.

This is the best wireless controller I've had for a system, period. It's just as solid as a default Sony PS2 controller but with the addition of full, forgiving wirelessness. I haven't had a single issue or problem with it, and if I can play it under a thick blanket, with the receiver blocked, without even pointing the thing at the system, I can't imagine that it won't meet anyone's gaming needs. I swear by this one and won't get another wireless brand again. In fact, I've since bought the Logitech wireless Xbox controller, and though I've only had it for a couple weeks, I'm getting the same results. Fine build from what looks to be a solid company. Definitely reccommended.","Excellent range, performance, and battery life",1132790400,5,,

For starters, the main function of the game is the rhythm game, where you play different songs with different characters, at different difficulty levels. If you've played any rhythm games before, the fundamentals will be familiar. Here, you can chose to use ""tap mode"" or ""button mode"", where you either touch the screen, or press the A/B/X/Y buttons, respectively. Since I'm a bumbling oaf, I figured button mode would be the easiest, but it turns out I like playing with tap mode better.

When you start the game, you choose which character you want to be, and the style of room. I chose Miku and the green room, but you can change that. The game uses StreetPass, so make sure you have an open StreetPass slot (Nintendo really needs to increase that). Since I've only had the game for less than a day, I haven't tagged anyone, nor have I used the AR cards. Dunno exactly how many AR cards there were, but seems like about 10.

When you play songs you earn points so you can buy new decorations for the room or outfits. There's some mini-games you can play. So far I've played Go, which you activate while in Hang-out mode. There's also a Tetris-style game on the main menu. You can collect different different stamps for accomplishments. You can take photos in game, which are saved to the SD or post them to Miiverse in the usual manner (there's a new Miiverse community for the game).

In the interests of brevity, I'm going to cut this short, but there are plenty of other things I haven't mentioned. If you like rhythm games, or just like Miku or the Nendoroid Vocaloids in general, this is a fun game so far with plenty to keep me occupied.",Project Mirai DX,1441756800,6,,

At the time, the ""FX"" chip was marketing hype for some new 3D technology. Nonetheless, it has become a classic at my home. My dad was hooked on StarFox since the beginning!

I bought some old N64 games and a N64 system about 2 years ago and starFox 64 was one of the games. Naturally, I'm hooked. The graphics are fairly pre-21st century but its a very natural progression for StarFox SNES.

Thd 3D graphics are colorful and saturated. There is also voice acting and some interesting levels.

The fun thing about this series is that while it's an RPG series, is that the combat is actually multiplayer, so you can enjoy playing through the stories or powering through the bosses with your friends.  I'll never forget those days with me and my friends sitting around trying to beat the hardest optional boss in this game on the hardest difficulty, timing combos together and screaming each time something went wrong, there aren't many other RPGs that can do that..if there are any outside of this series at all.  This includes Tales of Symphonia and the sequel to Tales of Symphonia, where all of the characters return a few years later, though you are playing the game from a more outside perspective, it's fun and interesting to meet your old heroes through someone elses eyes later in the story.
All of these Tales game have similar motifs, where its the story of a group mostly comprised of children being flung into this crazy unwinding story where they are forced to grow as individuals and as a team, and unlock mysteries about the world.  Both of these games have plenty of plot twists, it is kind of what these Tales games do after all.  Several interesting characters with interestingly different play styles.. the second game even has a sort of pokemon-esque mechanic where you can collect monsters and have them fight for you.
Overall I just have to say that these games are great, and this whole pack is great. The figurines are a nice addition to my collection - I've always wanted a Lloyd figurine. They are great quality little chibi figurines. And the soundtrack is nice too.

I have been carrying my hardware on the astro mission bag for over a year.  I got what i used to call my ""mobile command unit"" which is based on the PS3, X360 (on a separate backpack), A40s and the vizio 15 inch led.  It was fine and all, and since the G155 was not released when i decided to go mobile it was the best solution i could think of at that time.  Throughout this past year i saw the G155 and all the great reviews kept pilling up.  I was tempted, yet i decided to be satisfied with the vizio and the mission bag.  Time kept passing and the more i used my solution the more obvious it became it was not mobile at all, just decent.  So now i have the G155, and this is my story.

I use the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ultra-High-Performance-HDMI-Switcher-3to1-Switch/dp/B0015YWKYY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ultra High Performance HDMI Switcher, 3to1 Switch</a>&nbsp;to connect my X360 (inside the G155) and the PS3 (outside the G155) simultaneously and the experience has been a HUGE upgrade in simplicity and easy mobility.  I still use my mission bag for the PS3, A40 and other accessories, with the G155 next to it.  When open i like how the G155 has space on both sides of the console to put the controller when not in use, the A40 mixamp and the charging cable for the controller.  It just looks clean.  I used to have the vizio and a bunch of cables flying around and it was all just a mess.  Now i got the G155 and it provides a personal environment for a neat and beautiful gaming desk.

As for the G155 itself, i have put it on marathons with the X360 and PS3 and the performance of the screen is just awesome.  ZERO lag, fps are fluid and look great.  Skyrim looks awesome.  The screen performs as advertised and then some.  The speakers are better than expected, no gimmicks here is all about performance.

The case itself is just right.  Hard plastic, rubber feet in the right places, stable in vertical position, console sits tight and safe with the straps.  At some point i like using my x360 on the G155 than on the big TV.  for some reason i like the up close and personal feeling the G155 provides.

In my opinion, the G155 is not exclusive for mobile action.  If you are in college, or have one tv in the house the G155 can provide a perfect solution for that gamer in the house that needs to get its gaming fix.

Great product, great company, once you buy it you will know why the great reviews keep pilling up.

UPDATE
I have been using the ps3 with my g155 and noticed that the fans were getting way too loud and the heat build up around the console worried me. Because the ps3 does not allow full games install it gets pretty hot.
My tip is to take the storage pouches that come with the g155 and fold them in a way that when put under the ps3, one in each side, the ps3 is lifted just enough to allow better air flow through the side vents and the bottom is not compressed against the cushion. Also with this adjustment he usb ports are more accessible for charging the controller and using the ps3 wireless headset.  The straps will keep the ps3 in place, so don't worry about that. Hope it helps","This replaced my 15 inch vizio and made traveling with my consoles a LOT easier (UPDATE, nice ps3 tip)",1344470400,2,,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51aDgh7-SfL._SY88.jpg']

I watched tons of videos on youtube of people trying to play this game. After watching them i questioned the responsiveness of the controls because it seemed like the player would do the motion but it wouldn't be translated in the game...

...after playing the full game finally, I can safely say that the video reviewers were a bunch of no-flair flabby fannies. I was launching Ultra chains left and right. Blasting and punching my eniemies into oblivion!!!!

 The key to this game is THINK LIKE A POWER RANGER!!!

You have to really get into this game in order to really kick ass with it. The kinect picks up the moves so precisely. I can chain and ultra chain like there is no tomorrow. The trick is to visualize each move and plan ahead! Pay attention to the moves and move your body the way it asks. You will not be disappointed!!!

If you watch the same videos that I have, don't be discouraged by the sloppy play style. Every punch kick and block registered with the kinect. This game is alike a dream come true for me and I feel like a little kid again. it.

It is also packed with feature rich content like Practice, 2 Player splits screen, and online versus. You get more if you link your Ubisoft uplay account.

So last night i pop it in with some versus and I went 5 - 0 UNDEFEATED!!!!! (after 5 matches I was tired as hell!!) I got a PM from a kid asking how I launched the moves so fast and I told  him, exactly what I am telling you now..act like you're a real super hero! The guy got it and I think he got the hint.

5.0,False,"11 26, 2006",A23HCR977WY1YN,B000BC38LA,Adam,"Character Setup:

 You can become one of several races all with different attributes and special talents. Each race is better at certain skills than others, such as marksmanship or hand to hand. Be an archer, mage, warrior and much more. If you do not like your particular ability tree, you can customize your own. You can also customize your characters looks. You can make it look like you if you wish. The only downside is that it can take a good deal of time just to make a character look half decent.

Gameplay:

 In Oblivion, you are thrown right into the action as you sit in a prison cell(for no known reason) and suddenly confronted by the king and his body guards. From here the adventure begins. The Country side is perhaps the most beautiful you will see in a game. Each town is quite different than the other. Some towns are in the warm climate on level terrain and some are on snowy mountain tops and harder to navigate. Depending on what your character setup is, you can choose to join the theives guild, fighters guild or mages guild. It is quite obivious from the start of the game that you should partake in as many side-quests as possible. Not only to bring your skills up, but because it adds a whole new level of gameplay than if you were to just do the main quest. The biggest issue I had with the game was with the dungeons, keeps, caves and oblivion gates. They are all pretty generic in layout. It can get tiring (especially the oblivion gates) doing something you feel like you just did. Aside from that, interaction with characters in the cities, in your guild, and throughout the country makes the game all the more interesting. You'll run into highway men demanding money, theives and all sorts of ghostly and or monster like beings. Many, many hours of gameplay.

Graphics:

 Now this is perhaps one of the most demanding games on your computer. I did not have the greatest computer when I first got this game. When I built  my new computer, I was blown away by how much I was missing. With a fast processor, plenty of memory and a good video card, you will be able to run this game more towards the high end graphics wise. Unfortunately for those who have an older computer, you will not be able to see the game in all its glory.

Story:

 The story is pretty straight forward. I will not delve into it at all, but it is compelling enough to keep you playing.

I thoroughly enjoyed the game and will continue to. There are so many things to do and places to go that this game could very well be the last game you get for a while. Kudos to Bathesda for making an excellent game.","Fun, Entertaining Game",1164499200,5,,

So I went into this not expecting to be impressed, given some of the things I've read about servers being down and game bugs galore.  I can honestly say that, a month after the official release, I've experienced none of that.

Instead, I found a golf game that's quite possibly the best Tiger Woods PGA Tour game, ever!  Yep, I really really like this game.  It combines all the good parts of past TW PGA Tour games and none of the bad.  You even get--count 'em--a generous serving of 25 golf courses included (in the Historic Edition)!  Better still, unlike the last Masters edition I bought, if you don't have the course that's next on the tour, no problem.  You're not forced to buy the course, you can simply substitute an existing one to your tournament.

Pin Packs, which are collectible pins that boost your stats for a round, are available at the Store, but you don't have to buy them if you don't want to, and you don't have to feel you're missing out on something if you don't. In fact, after I purchased a Pin Pack just to see what it was, I haven't bought any since.  I don't need them to play.  You can purchase Pin Packs with either MS points, or with game coins earned from playing.

Country Clubs are back. Start your own or join an existing one, reap the benefits of club bonuses with friends.  Plus now, Night Golf!  There's even an achievement called ""Find the Werewolf""! (google this for a Youtube video)

I find the golf mechanics are pretty much perfect this time around, from the swing meter to the putting, although sometimes the camera on the putting surface is in the wrong position.  There's a demo available on Xbox live so you can see for yourself.  By far, the best feature of the Historic Edition is the ability to play against legends from the past.  This is presented in scratchy sepia tone and is just so much fun to see the old courses, clothes and of course, golf clubs--cleeks, jiggers, and baffing spoons etc.

If you're an armchair golfer who has played past TW PGA Tour games and are on the fence with this one, give the demo a try.  I did, then I came right back to Amazon to purchase it!  Great golf game!",Best Tiger Woods game in a long time,1365984000,10,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

5.0,False,"05 24, 2012",A6BHE6E9VV5BE,B0009A4EVM,Nishi,"Story:
Like all the other Kingdom Hearts games, the story is amazing. It follows Sora a year after the events of Kingdom Hearts one and Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories which he has been sleeping the entire time. Everything just starts fitting into place as you progress through the story and it has a ton of meaning playing through it again after the spinoffs.

By far this game has the best tutorial I have played in any game. You control Roxas at the start of the game at Twilight Town and while you are progressing through the days you are getting a recap of what happened during KH1 and CoM. All the characters that are introduced along the way are pretty awesome, and we get a ton more Final Fantasy characters in this segment (Which is always cool, ya know?).

Once we play as Sora we are revisiting a bunch of worlds we went to during the first game and a bunch of crazy stuff is happening with Organization 13. We even get to visit some new worlds, including a really cool one called Space Paranoids. Everything just flows really nice and we get a more time on the Disney world's than what Kingdom Hearts 1 had, with a really awesome story to make sense why.

Gameplay:

Fighting:
They have updated the fighting in this game so much over the first game. Not only do normal attacks, rolls, and blocks feel more fluid, they feel much more fast pace and powerful. On top of that, they learned from their mistake with the first game and set the camera to the right analogue stick.

Magic gets a little revamp as well, and it's more of an mp bar (like the HP bar) and not MP segments. When enemies get killed they drop little bubbles that restore your MP. Magic also seems more powerful in this game to me, and I noticed Donald Duck not dying a ton like he did in Kingdom Hearts 1 and killing enemies more often as well. Summons is based on your MP now (Since the Drive Gauge is for different forms).

While killing enemies you are building up your Drive gauge. Once it is full Sora is able to transform into different Keyblade style forms (Like a magic one, a physical one, etc). This makes killing enemies a ton of fun, while making you more powerful at the same time. Some of the forms even end up transforming again, making you even more powerful for boss fights. This can backfire at times and an end up turning you into the Anti-Form, which is resembles something from the first game.

While visiting worlds they sometimes add some fun little gameplay additions to the game. For example, in the Mulan world you have to make sure your Morale Gauge is full or its game over. Or in Space Paranoids you can do a Light Cycle Mini-game. They really add to the levels and make them unique in their own way so nothing gets to grindy over time.

Gummi Ship:
The best mini game of Kingdom Hearts makes a return in this game and its better than ever. Now they have set up missions in-between worlds, so you can replay them any time you want, and make it easier to travel between worlds. When you select one of them you have the option of starting the mission or editing your ship.

At the editing menu you choose from the blueprints you have collected or create a ship from scratch like the first game. At the editing menu is where things really change. You have options of placing Gummi parts, copying some parts and placing them on the ship, rotating pieces, editing the color of all or one piece of the ship, editing already created ships, adding ability units, undo/redo, how the blocks will show up while your editing the ship, changing the mode (Which is the same as this, but instead of normal parts your placing weapons and exhaust systems), saving and exiting.

From there editing the ships is the same idea of placing the blocks where you want them, within the cost (CPU) that you have available. Cost upgrades later will allow you to place more pieces. Once you progress a little through the story you unlock Teeny Gummi ships which fly with you and shoot projectiles out just like you do, but sometime blocks attacks from enemies or use their own special abilities.

Levels are quite different than the first games ones, and you are fighting nobody ships this time around. During the level you may need to turn right/left/behind of the area you are in to flank and beat some ships, which leads to more strategy and ships to kill during the levels themselves. The music changes up as well, and really make the levels feel unique and if this wasn't just a mini game, but an actual on rails shooter title game.

You can also choose to have full auto fire or semi auto fire of the weapons to your liking. During the levels you can defeat special ships that unlock parts and other ships and each mission has its own treasure list of things you can collect. At the end of the mission you get a briefing on how you did, the points you earned, amount of enemies you destroyed, items you unlocked and if it was your first time through you get an additional prize.

Soundtrack:
The amazing Kingdom Hearts soundtrack is still great in this game. All the worlds have recognizable and memorable themes to them, which never really get old when you're exploring the worlds (even after playing multiple Kingdom Hearts games). The main theme and song return in this game and they mean so much more after playing the Kingdom Hearts games. Atlantica's Under the Sea was really awesome, and hearing Sora sing it is priceless.

Speaking of voice actors they did a really good job again with finding the right voice actors to represent the characters. Like the voice of Mushu wasn't Eddie Murphy, but I couldn't tell the difference at all and only knew that when I looked up the voice actors. All the characters sound right (Even the Final Fantasy ones without voice acting in their original games) so even if they couldn't get the original voice actors for the characters in the games, Square knows how to pick people who sound just like them.

Graphics:
I really think these graphics have aged well. The main characters mouths move to the words, they look detailed for a PS2 game and mixed with the Disney look to the levels I think they did a good job making sure everything looks nice.

This is another PS2 game that looks fine when stretched out on my TV, all the text is readable and the CGI cutsceens still look amazing to this day. Seeing all the worlds again in upgraded graphics is really awesome and all the world based characters look great. Speaking of the worlds, they all have their unique look based on the Disney movie they are about. Especially Space Paranoids, that place looks amazing and it's my favorite Kingdom Hearts world.

Verdict:
With this being my first Kingdom Heart game, I really love this game and the epic tale it takes you through. With a really fun battle system, great update to the Gummi system and tons more to do on the worlds, I say this is a worthy addition to the Kingdom Hearts franchise. Along with that, those who played 358/2 days will have so much more value to the story. I will stick to my thinking that they have planned this epic, multi game tale since everything is just fitting into place perfectly.

The races are tighter and faster, therefore, it seems like either the game engrosses my attention span too much or the campaign is that short. I played through roughly 15-20 races last night and 5 hours had passed. I guess that's good, right? But at the same time, the game is so good I guess I just don't want it to end. Played non-3D first, and my jaw hung open during every race. Then, I tackled 3D for a few races.. my jaw is now dislocated and I'm seeking medical therapy. I can only type this because I can't talk. This is somewhat a nuisance.

All jokes aside, the game is great.

For those skeptical and turned off by other reviews saying that the campaign mode is non-relevant and a horrible addition, I kindly disagree. The motion comics are for the most part fun to watch, and garner a laugh from time to time. It's a fresh idea, and I commend developers for adding a little life to the franchise. If it bothers you THAT much, you can skip each cut-scene with a simple press of the 'X' button. These scenarios remind me of the cut-scenes in inFamous, and they are very colorful and interesting to watch between races.

My ONLY gripe is that all races in the campaign look to have PREDETERMINED vehicles chosen, whereas previous Motorstorm games would have a few predetermined races set up but most would give you the option of which vehicle to battle it out in. There is an option in ""Wreckreation"" mode on the main menu that allows freely choosing vehicles and tracks to FREE PLAY as many you like, which is fine. Therefore, I suppose you could say they covered all their bases, but it would have been fun to have vehicle choice within the actual campaigns.

It is a first person dungeon crawler with turn based combat. If you aren't into turn based combat avoid this game, but if you like turn based combat or are on the fence I highly recommend this game. You will encounter monsters in the various caves/dungeons/labyrinths and there is a color coded indicator of when you will encounter an enemy, so it is not entirely ""random encounters"", like dragon quest/final fantasy games. Also the graphics are great and the skill system and subclassing are extremely fun and pretty simple and intuitive. I extremely enjoyed drawing my map as I explored on the bottom screen. Everything about this game is so much fun, but bear in mind it can be very difficult if you don't take your time and level up and/or have a solid strategy for each fight.

Game play - 10/10 turn based combat and exploring at their FINEST

Graphics - 8/10 I would have liked to see your characters on the battlefield but the scenery and monster models are fantastic, but the 3D is kind of lacking

Music - 10/10 I didn't care much for the town music but once you leave the town the music in this game is some of the best I've ever heard and I've played games for 15+ years.

Difficulty - 8/10 I haven't had too many problems, but sometimes you kind of have to trial/error some battles but make sure you SAVE OFTEN.

Much has already been said about the difficulty of this game, so suffice it to say that yes, this game is really hard.  I continually went back and forth between loving and then hating this game, then hating & loving it at the same time.  I actually almost gave up entirely on it after only a few hours into it, but then went on to spend way too many hours playing through not one, but two playthroughs.  I know what you're thinking, because when I heard there was a New Game Plus, I thought, who would be insane enough to not just finish this game, but then go ahead and subject themselves to it again.  Insane, but when I finally finished the last boss, and got dumped right back where you start the game, I barely paused before I started back up the hill like Sisyphus.

That's the nature of this game, it gets under your skin, and you keep pushing forward over and over again, despite the frustration there may be in each repetition.  Besides all that though, they really created such a perfect mood through lighting, overall look & feel, and subtle use of music, to get across the feeling of existing/non-existing in an undead nightmare world.  And it is a very rewarding feeling to finally accomplish a task that constantly stymies you.

Here's a word of advice for new players: avoid ""traversing the white light"" with a bunch of souls that you would be very sorry to lose.  Before facing a boss, just go back and farm enough souls to level up, or spend them at a merchant.  You'll play much more effectively if instead of worrying about your accumulated souls, or getting crushed when you lose them, that you focus entirely on the problem in front of you.  Good Luck.  It does get easier.  (then it gets harder again, but don't worry about that right now.)","Fun, or Self-Inflicted Torture? You decide.  (hint: it's both.)",1343433600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Back in my Playstation One days I can remember my cousin purchasing Metal Gear Solid, while I picked up Xenogears.  I blew off Metal Gear Solid when I was younger because I was into JRPGs and I didn't like the thought of stealth games.  About a year after it was released my cousin mastered the game and decided to force me to play it.  I'm glad I listened to him because it started one of the greatest love/hate relationships of my gaming history.  I have loved the Metal Gear Series for it's intricate story design (or confusing to some), awesome weapons and accessories, and constant improvements to gameplay with each iteration.  The hate comes from me completely sucking at stealth gameplay.  I have never been a sneaky player and every Metal Gear had a semi-linear path for me to get from point A to point B.  This linear path gave many players the ability to master the routes and mannerisms of the AI (see youtube videos of gamers manhandling the AI), but not me.  I would start a section of the game and Rambo my way to the next cinema.  I understand the feeling of immersion that Hideo Kojima and his team is trying to convey to me, but it never worked for me until The Phantom Pain.

Now this game takes everything great about the Metal Gear Series (stealth, gunplay, action, story, crazy characters) and adds the most magical triad in gaming - an open world, crafting, and allowable upgrades.  In other words, we have a glorious sandbox game with heavenly RPG elements tactfully inserted in the right places.  I mentioned immersion before and how it didn't work for me.  In this game, I care about being stealthy because I don't have a linear path to follow.  Each small village, prison camp, and road checkpoint allows for multiple ways to subdue enemies.  In previous Metal Gear games, I didn't care so much about the rating because I was more interested in the next cinema.  Now I actually care about my rating at the end of the mission because I am more involved.

If you're like me and didn't care for the previous Metal Gear games because you felt like they were missing something, don't let it stop you from purchasing The Phantom Pain.  This game is awesome and deserves your money and praise.",Stealth Sucks,1442880000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Web of Shadows takes everything was great about Spider-Man 2 and adds more. The combat is simply incredible. Not only can you engage foes on the ground, but now you can take the fights to the side of buildings, and even into mid air (something I have always wanted to do.)The swinging controls are also good and very smooth. All the controls integrate very well with the Wii-mote and nun chuck.

There are lots of things to do in this game, and although the story mode is a tad short, it's made up for by a large number of side missions.

Currently you have the option to spend $80+ on a used 3rd party wireless SNES controller from the 1990's or you can go with this, the controller does feel kinda cheap in quality and I wish they would have used better plastic but it feels pretty decent with batteries installed. I put this side by side to an official SNES controller and it's the exact same size, there is no noticeable lag unless you sat there and timed everything down to  millisecond's and with a wireless controller using this technology I think extremely minor lag should be expected anyway, I can lay in my bed 10 to 12 feet away from the receiver and play without any problems at all and it feels great in my hands.

One major flaw though is there are no instructions on how to pair the controller to the receiver unless you scan some bar code on the box with an app on your tablet which is by far one of the stupidest things ever, I don't think it would have been that costly to include a small sheet of paper telling you how to pair it. You push the button on the receiver and hold down the Select and Start buttons to pair it.

Personally I do recommend this if you want to get rid of those controller cords and be able to sit away from your TV without worrying about someone tripping over the cord and pulling your precious SNES off the entertainment center.",A must have for a SNES or Super Famicom owner,1437609600,4,,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714Y1SvhLML._SY88.jpg']

The only thing that kept Gears 2 from feeling like an expansion pack for Gears 1 was its sheer epic scale.

There is no such issue with Gears 3. The game play is instantly familiar and as rock solid as it's ever been, but the look and feel is a bit different and improved. That ""extra year"" of development this game had is right there on the screen. Some of the character models have been updated to the point where they're off-putting at first and take some getting used to (I'm looking at you, Cole and Baird) and that's the closest thing I have to a gripe about this game so far.

5.0,True,"04 30, 2015",ADVH7U8NNI8FV,B00O8B7D02,Taylor L,"I had previously purchased the t100 steering wheel before purchasing this one only to realize that wheel just wasn't going to live up to my expectations. I needed something more advanced, more serious and the T300RS wheel is just what I was initially looking for and more!

Main Points:
- The steering wheel itself, not including the base, has some nice weight to it and it feels like it's about the same weight as a real detachable racing wheel. It's covered by rubber which makes it very easy to grip onto during some hard racing, even with sweaty hands. The wheel base is very nicely made out of smooth, but tough plastic. I think it will last for quite a long time as the motor works very well and efficiently. The fan kicks on rather quickly, about 20-30 minutes depending on your in-game force feedback settings, albeit quietly, to prevent overheating. You won't hear it over your racing setup.

Tip: This may be going over the top, but I usually have a house fan running in the room that I'm using the wheel so there's proper air circulation for the fan inside the wheel base. It's just a preventative measure I take considering how expensive the wheel was and is. Hard telling if it actually makes a difference or not. Just something to try.

- The pedals themselves are made of metal/steel however the pedal base is made from plastic. The pedals are adjustable and it's as simple as unscrewing a few screws to move the steel pedal heads (not sure what to call them) where you want them. If you're not using a wheel stand like I am, I could see the pedals liking to move around on a surface like the carpet because there are no grips along the bottom. I suggest pushing them up against a (sturdy) table or box to prevent this, although, I've heard that if you use both feet on them at once (one foot brake/one on gas) while racing that the pedals will stay put somewhat. I am not at liberty to say if that actually works or not as I've never tried it with two feet at once without a stand.

- The force feedback is very strong and accurate, although it varys by game, obviously. For the most part though it is incredibly realistic. If the back tires are slipping out, you can feel it in the wheel right away. If you get in a big wreck, you can also feel that quite well. Got a tire going down? You can FEEL it. I guess that's the whole point of this little section. Absolutely no problems or complaints with the force feedback from this guy. Thrustmaster put a great little motor in the wheel base and it sure does the job well.

All in all I highly suggest this wheel as it can be used with the PS4, PS3, and PC (when used on PC make sure its on PS3 mode, not PS4). Yes it is pricey, but it is very much worth it if you want a serious sim racer wheel. It will last a very long time if you take good care of it. I would personally suggest buying this wheel with a stand, however. It is much more enjoyable to use it that way for me anyways.

Connection:
This headset has three plugs.  One for Audio, one for the Mic and a USB for lights.  When connecting to a PC with sound card it is flawless and easy.  I tested with a laptop and an Xbox as well.  In order to connect to my laptop and Xbox and use the Mic I needed an adapter to convert the two plugs to a single one.  This would be a nice addition to add in the box.

Size & Fit:
The headset was very comfortable and easily adjusts to my head and my sons.

Look:
They are a nice headset without excessive flare but also unique.

Sound:
I am not an audiophile expert but I have tried many different headphones/headsets over the years so have experience with both good and bad sounding ones.  I have found these to sound quite well.  The bass was good and essentially acted like noise cancelling headphones.  The Mic was nicely placed as I didn't want to have a long protruding one.  I was told that I sounded clear on the other end of the game.

Pros:
Cost - It is a good price for the quality
Sound  very clear with decent bass
Mic  Doesnt have a long protruding Mic!

Cons:
The only thing I would recommend is for these to include the adapter so can be used with laptops and gaming consoles with only a single plug.

Overall:
I am pleased with these headphones and would recommend these as a good sounding, gaming headset with long lasting comfort. This is the first headset/headphones from Sades I have used but would recommend them.","Nice headphone, small Mic and good price",1427760000,30,"{'Size:': ' Arcmage White', 'Color:': ' white black'}",

Honestly if you've never played any of these do yourself a favor and start with the first one. It's still an amazing game even today.

That being said when it comes to dark souls essentially you either love it or hate it. i still remember when i picked up the first game because a buddy of mine was telling me about how he was getting destroyed in it. i thought sure, why not. a few days later i load it up and watch my character, who i designed to look like a member from the blue man group, awake to a body falling on his head inside a prison cell. soon after i wandered through a dank disturbing prison until i found myself attempting to fight off a massive monster 10 times my size while wearing a loin cloth and wielding a broken sword. This was the moment i knew that i was playing possibly the best game of all time.

I have never stopped feeling this way about dark souls. Its one of the few titles out there that give you the feeling that your not really sure what your doing but you know that whatever your doing it feels important and you have to keep moving. In that same light there is always a sense of exploration, of anticipation of whats around the next corner. It gives you the uneasy desire to continue even after something devours your face, stabs a spear through your back or smashes you with a giant fist. There is always that perfect ""YOU DIED"" screen that pops up every time you fail that somehow entices you to continue on in your misery and fight harder to retrieve the one thing that can make you stronger .

The world is dark, the enemies are all out to destroy you at every opportunity that you give them, and your only hope is to overcome the endless abominations that plague a land drenched in death. you'll find a multitude of various items, all with their own strengths and weaknesses. You will wander through ruins, traverse through poison swamps, and find your way into snow capped buildings wrapped in a magical aura. Along your path you'll meet allies and enemies in great number, and while some my seem incompetent or treacherous they all have their part to play in the fate that leads you to your ultimate destiny.

This is what dark souls is to me, an experience that isn't like anything else out there. something that was born from the best imaginations and the cruelest of intentions. It to me is a perfect example of a gripping adventure that your able to immerse yourself in and create a character that you feel is your own. While the story might be the same for everyone that plays it, it does still feel like its your story when your in it. It seems that you are the hero or the villain of your own tale.

Over time and with practice over the three games the mechanics have become easier both to do and to understand, but i never felt that it took away from one of the most enjoyable games i've ever played. The only faults i found in the game was that hollowing seems not to really do anything anymore and that your unable to upgrade armor. these are small gripes though and certainly don't take away from the game in general.

Do yourself a favor, at least give it a try if you haven't already. Its well worth your time and it will remain one of my favorite games for years to come.

The unit is designed very simply. You sit your 360 into this stand, and it cools the unit from below. You can put one game box to the right side, and your remote to the left. Really, that's not why you get the unit though :) It's all about the fan.

If you haven't been watching the news or hanging out with other gamers, the XBox 360 is VERY prone to crashing and completely melting down due to heat issues. Part of this might be that gamers lay their XBox 360s down on the ground - blocking all the vents so the system can't get normal air flow - or they jam their unit into a corner where the heat builds up. This system really needs to have ample air cooling around it and be in a vertical position. This stand helps to make sure you get that vertical position and that you have extra cooling. You REALLY want to keep the unit - like any computer or electronic device - away from lint, dust and other air-junk. Hopefully you are vacuuming frequently - and if you have a carpeted floor - have the unit on a piece of wood or something else to protect it.

By default the unit is USB powered so that you can plug it into the XBox 360 and then plug an USB item into the fan. However, it's sort of silly to make the XBox 360 work harder (and get hotter) to then power a fan to cool it down :) It's much better to plug the fan into the wall directly so that the XBox 360 gets as cool as possible while the fan draws its power from the wall. Most gamers have the necessary USB wall plug to handle this pretty easily - and if you don't, it's a cheap item to get.

The only real down side is that the fan has a manual on switch, but in the grand scheme of things, that's not a huge issue especially since you want it to turn on and off independently of the XBox 360. Also, I suppose you could complain about the fan's quiet noise, but since the XBox 360 is already a noisy machine, that's pretty much a wash.

Considering how much money an XBox 360 costs, and how frequently the average owner plays with it, it is VERY worth it to keep it cool and running well.",A Fan's a Must-Have for XBox 360 Owners,1168732800,11,,

Elevated by a fierce attention to detail and setting rife for ethical pondering, The Witcher 3 stands out against the roster of high-fantasy role-playing games on the strength of storytelling and structure. This is a game where even the most seemingly mundane side-quest can quickly spiral into a sprawling, multi-tiered tale of wit and woe. NPCs are complex and often crafty, working toward their own goals at Geralt's expense (and sometime vice-versa). It's elaborate, clever, and never anything less than engrossing.

Excellent dialogue, pacing, and variety drive the Witcher 3 to gaming greatness, but there are a few issues CD Projekt Red can look to improve on with future titles. Interacting with certain objects in the environment can be challenging to the point of frustration: there where numerous times where I had to scale narrow ledges to reach an obscure interactable object, only to have the game's touch-and-go character movement send me careening off a cliff-side. Likewise, there were a number of bugs that rendered some of the lesser quests unbeatable, but these seem to have been corrected with the latest patch (which made massive improvements to the menu and inventory systems, to boot).

Overall, The Witcher 3 is an essential next-gen RPG experience, perfect for high fantasy genre fans and everyday gamers alike.","A Wild, Sprawling Ride from Start to Finish",1466294400,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I was pleasantly suprised after playing this even though it doesn't seem to be getting much praise. This game is a blast  with tons of eye-candy, very fun and challenging levels, at times, very challenging. My kids(10 and 7) play most of the time but every once and a while they have to call upon ""The Master Video Gamer""(Me-38) to help them through a section. I can't help but get caught up into it while playing, so much so, the kids have to remind me to give the controller back. It's fun!

Look, I've been a Crash fan since the beginning(PS1) and this is a fantastic addition to the series. Even though there's no furriness(I don't think that's a word?) to Crash like the first XBOX Crash and the graphics are alittle on the PS2 side(which isn't bad by any means) the game is very fun and beautiful to look at.

FFT is a great game but it got too easy -- this game keeps the challenge going unless you grind to the max. The maps are large enough to create different strategies and plans of attack.

5.0,True,"10 5, 2008",A254QJ5BTEUH85,B001383L36,Magus,"Well I played Metal Gear Solid 4, and after I beat it I wanted to know more of the back story. I looked up Metal Gear Solid: The Essential Collection, for this offered $30 for all 3 games. This was perfect, no searching around everywhere buying separate overpriced games.

MGS1 was early PSX technology, it was one of the newer 3d games at the time. Like all MGS's it's mainly stealth gameplay. The enemy soldiers are the easiest of the MG series. It's a good introduction into the gameplay until later titles. Your main character is Solid Snake who has to rescue 2 hostages, but the mission becomes much more. He has to stop the Metal Gear, a weapon of destruction. The villians in this one as well as other Metal Gear's are strange and introduce you to their back stories along the way. You'll meet up with Meryl in the game, a lady soldier who helps you out at times. This game is actually my 2nd favorite MGS game after 4.

MGS2 has some mixed reviews, let's just say you won't play Snake the whole time. You'll also play as Raiden a new soldier being sent out to rescue the president, and prevent an explosion and environmental disaster on a water base. You do get the impression of him being a rookie, he complains at times, and seems to be learning with each new sitution. He's an ok character to me.

The thing I don't like in this game mainly for me is the base itself, it seems like your going back and forth in circles. Like go to Strut A and to Core 2, to Strut AB. You do this alot. The spy robot are also a pain, I prefered the cameras. Now the story is good, like the other MGS's. This is the least favorite game still out of the series, not good exactly overall but ok.

MGS 3 is the hardest out of all MGS's for me. I've died quite alot. You play Big Boss when he was younger, known now as the original Snake. You'll have a lot of enemies bunched together. It's a harder to stealth enemies. You have the added camoflouge in this game accordingly to the envirionment your in. For example dirt plantless environment, dark, forest, etc. The enemies are hard to see themselves, they take on the color of their environment. This game has the best story in my opinion, but it's hard and can be frustating.

The enemies in this are crazy as always, a guy with bees and a 100 year old sniper or some of them. In all the MGS's you get a radar, in this game you only get sonar. The sonar you have to click the R3 button, so it's tougher in this one. You can change the camera angle in this subsitence version, the older MGS 3 you couldn't. The camera change in this does help somewhat.

There's just no beating this deal. If your interested in even 1 MGS game, just get the whole pack it's $30 anyways. I'm glad I have the whole story line now, and going through them a second time should be easier. Remember some of them you get away less with stealth than others, so be wary. I really enjoyed this series.",Liquid Snake,1223164800,,,

Not content with a mere visual upgrade, NBA 2K14 on Sonys next generation system plays a totally different ball game to its existing sibling  and while some of these enhancements undeniably have niggles, they're still terrific additions to an already excellent game.

This is a title thats drenched in more authenticity than a players vest at the end of a high-octane quarter. Recognisable commentators Kevin Harlan, Steve Kerr, and Clark Kellogg narrate with considerable clarity, while Doris Burke interviews various athletes at half-time. Meanwhile, sponsor video transitions pop up alongside NBA logos and help to sell the television broadcast feel as if it were real.
And this is, of course, where the visual prowess of the PS4 comes in, with each court feeling alive due to the varied crowds and immaculate models. There are moments where the immersion is so great that youll forget that its a game  even if the uncanny valley will creep in eventually when a player fails to convey the right emotion, or a couple of identical twins pop up in the audience and make the same cheering motion. The issues are more noticeable due to the outstanding achievements elsewhere  but the game sure does hint at plenty of promise for the future.

In fact, given that sports games have historically struggled with the generation jump, its amazing how realistic this title looks and feels. Animations are much more fluid and realistic, and theres a sense of physicality to the play that wasn't quite there before. In addition, the artificial intelligence is competent and, at times, lifelike  and thats without even mentioning the wealth of new modes and features.
For starters, My Career now plays out like a more structured narrative  a soap opera even. Cutscenes, dialogue trees, and personal objectives form part of your career and the story of your player. Upon picking a likeness, youll start shooting some hoops in the Rookie Showcase, discovering a rival that will follow you through your career and sculpting a personality that affects your team interactions and fan support.

Throughout your career, you can chat with your manager, coaches, and fellow players, having general conversations as well as more meaningful, life shaping ones. Youll begin by watching matches unfold from the bench, ready to jump in should an injury impede the game or the coach decide to take a chance on you. Then its all up to you to prove that you're worth a place in the starting line-up. Its a neat addition that provides a sense of progress to the campaign  even if the voice acting is weak and the coach interactions are restricted to text.
There are other issues, too. Youll encounter some of the same conversations with your coach multiple times, while youll often be given strange mid-match objectives that don't necessarily gel with your teams playing style. For as cute as the idea is, its not an especially engaging narrative either  but its at least a refreshing change from the bland campaigns that are otherwise so common in the sports genre.

Other modes include My GM, which allows you to manage an NBA franchise in a socially interactive style. Youll be able to converse with the teams owner, players, coaches, media outlets, and other executives to solve problems, help grow your franchise, and try to find the right balance between keeping everyone happy and managing your players on the court. As with the campaign, though, the dialogue is atrocious throughout.
Online, you can now play The Park street matches with buddies, as well as the standard head-to-head option. Meanwhile, the collectible card game My Team makes a return, which challenges you to create a fantasy squad in a similar style to FIFAs popular Ultimate Team. One new addition includes Domination, which allows you to pit your assembled squad against all-star teams and real-world rosters.

Conclusion

NBA 2K14 on the PS4 is a stunning digital facsimile of basketball. The titles visually jaw dropping, technically stunning, and represents a whole different ball game to its PS3 counterpart. The new My Career and My GM campaigns don't always score a slam dunk, but they're engaging enough to dribble your way through, making this is a top option if you're eager to shoot some hoops on Sonys next generation console.",Definitely Worth It,1387497600,7,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I had this game for some time now, and I finally decided to right a review about this. Well the game is great, there is more then a 100 cars in this game, and a lot of cool weapons.
To be hounest the only bad thing in this game is that there is only 1 level but it's huge. The levels were hard so I used cheats. I think its funner with cheats. Some diffrences from vice city, and GTA3 is that in vice city there are motorcycles. You can buy houses/clubs and get money for that. The guy Tommy Vercety (im not shure if I spelled his name right) is talking in Vice City, but not in GTA3. You can ride helicaptors in vice city. You cant ride a train in vice city, and I think GTA3 too.
There is a lot of sweet new cars in Vice City.
Basiclly the game is exellent and you should get it.
Playing Vice City on PS2 is better than computer because the countrolls are easyer, though I played this game on computer.

5.0,False,"11 19, 2008",A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000FRS9II,Cloud,"Let's face it: hype can really bring down a game, especially post-launch when after all the buzz and expectations have been quieted down and you look at it not in terms of ""will this game rock?"" but rather ""does it deserve to be called that awesome?"" In the case of Gears of War, one of the big premier blockbusters for the Xbox 360, it's one of those cases where, indeed there is some entertainment to be had and it's the perfect game when you want to just kill stuff without having to go online to deal with annoying brats. But then again, this game does have its flaws and they're pretty easy to spot but since it's Gears, people go ""meh, no big deal"" whereas most games get called out and criticized heavily. All this being said, Gears of War is still a fun game but one that can get maddeningly frustrating while it delivers balls-to-the-wall entertainment.

Story: On the planet Sera, the inhabitants have been terrorized by an alien race known as the Locust Horde who suddenly popped out of the ground on Emergence Day (""E-Day"") and are gradually reducing the number of the survivors. While fighting through a prison, Dom Santiago rescues his friend and your main guy, Marcus Fenix, and it's up to you to make it through dangerous cities and areas to hopefully nail a crippling blow to the Locust Horde.

Yep, that's it. That's the story and I'm not trying to be mean here since there's not much plot here and what plot there is tends to be skipped over or not given as much depth. Fans who have played 2 will note 2 references to Maria and yet even that plot wasn't given as much attention despite Epic saying it's more ""epic and personal"". There's one line about the ""sham"" of a trial that Marcus had, well what kind of sham? Still don't know. As far as the game's story is concerned, I wasn't a big fan of the pacing. While indeed it's fairly short at 8-10 hours give or take the difficulty and skill, the pieces never really felt connected and there was some really slow parts. Not an in-depth story by any stretch but likable enough to push through.

Graphics: This is really a cosmetic nitpick than anything but I never liked the blood in games that uses the Unreal Engine like Uncharted since it was seemed more mass-like and gooey than a liquid but in a game like this, it seems to go hand-in-hand. But one can't deny the graphical power of the engine and from the extremely detailed character animation, scale of the firefights and architecture make this a showcase for what the 360 can bring to the table. Really small nags are the famous Unreal Engine texture problems, occasional pauses, slight framerate things but they're usually never an issue or distracting enough to cause frustration. One thing though is despite how stunning it looks, it's very drab looking with a lot of mild colors and desaturated colors but that's sort of a Gears look I guess.

Sound/Music: The movie 300 was something that I tried several times to get into but I never could and one theory was that it was basically a movie for the frat boys who'll cheer at the violent parts and revel in the weird use of heavy metal music yet it has quote-unquote ""depth"" that made it different than most action movies. Not. Gears of War on the other hand knows it's basically a dumb summer blockbuster movie and just rolls with it from the line readings and one-liner dialogue. It's not meant to elicit tears but it's not eye-rolling either. The music however is fantastic from the creeping sound design to the big bombastic moments during firefights, this is one to have a stereo on.

Gameplay: Whereas shooters like Call of Duty or Halo are all about strafing a little bit from a wall or cover just enough to nail the enemy, Gears of War is all about taking cover. From columns to big blocks of stone, doorways, ruined cars etc, just press A and your character slams his side and is able to avoid enemy fire. Pressing the LT lets you take aim and RT to fire or pressing RT is just covering fire, inaccurate but helpful for nailing charging Locusts without wanting to pop up. Carrying up to 4 weapons at a time, we have the Hammer of Dawn, a laser-targeting system where a satellite will beam huge rays onto the area and all but vaporizing the enemy to standard pistols and shotgun. The highlight of course is the Lancer, which is basically a normal assault rifle only it has a chainsaw for a bayonet. Just hold the B, get closer to an enemy and zzzzzz!, you saw them in half. Only problem is that getting shot stops the revving and it's really frustrating to try to chainsaw someone only to get shot and have it stop.

The big problem with the game is the AI and not the enemies who'll flank, throw grenades and do whatever it takes till you're lifeless on the ground. The AI problems come from your teammates since they are, to borrow a Yahtzee phrase, ""pants-on-head retarded"". They'll openly go out of cover for seemingly no apparent reason other than wanting to get closer and they'll end up crying for help to be revived which you do by pressing X near the body. It happens with such frequency that I even saved one guy only to literally need help 4 seconds later when he got out of cover instead of just staying put. While co-op in most games is more fun, here it's more beneficial you go through it co-op since the players will be smarter than the game itself. You can issue squad commands like attack, cease fire and regroup but more often that not it's like ""I can't do that right now"". Hope you like to babysit.

Another issue is that the A button becomes a multi-use button from slipping in and out of cover, doing a ""roadie run"", swat turns and rolling out of the way and many times I'd try to get away only to take cover and it's like ""no, I want you to roll"".  Oh and there is some incredibly trying moments in the difficulty where Hardcore is fairly hard at times thanks to the AI of your squad but also it's very frustrating to all of a sudden be shot by a rocket launching bugger or the Torque Bow users when you're trying to do something else. One time I was in a battle and enemies literally spawned right behind me and I had no idea they were even there. Strangely they fixed this in the sequel where it was more easier yet more funner so least that's an improvement.

As far as the multiplayer is concerned, you gotta admire Epic releasing so many maps, especially for 2 (they're up to 29 now) but it's slightly disappointing. During ""join a quick match"", after 3 refreshes it literally cycled between the same 2 matches almost as if out of the, I'm sure thousands, that still play this online, there's only 2 matches that even pop up. Plus the match itself is a race, who can find the sniper first, who got the boomshot first and for the most part it's not like Killzone or Call of Duty where at least you have balancing between shotguns, RPG's etc but here it's like ""I have a grenade launcher and you don't"" which usually means an easier win for them. Despite the matchmaking and lag of the sequel, I found it a way funner multiplayer and this one is probably one of the few I'd consider boosting then leaving it alone.

Is it game of the year? No, well at least not to me but considering the huge release and fanfare the game got, it sure seems like it. But it's like a lot of movies out there that get exceedingly popular for no reason other than it's fun yet it's got a couple of issues.",A few bullets short of perfect,1227052800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

1. The graphix, the graphix in this game are trully awe inspireing.
2. very few bugs, this game released practiclly flawless and they work hard to keep it that way.
3. Trion, this company and its Devs trully care about what they are doing, the customer service, and security, and actually comunicating with the community is beyond reproach.
4. there is so much to do in this game, It takes the very definition of the word Sandbox and brings it to a whole new level.
5. the sound, they put so much love into the attention to detail in the graphix it also shows in the sound as well, some of the sounds are as beutifull as they are haunting.
cons
there are very few cons but the only one i can think of is:

1. most of the game is adjustable including the UI and all aspects of it except for one, and that is:

The Mouse curser, its too small for the UI and its also colored Red, most of the spells are red and it sometimes blends into the background. It would be wonderful if they made it so it was both adjustable in size / shape / color.

5.0,True,"01 7, 2015",A15CPR2THP14BO,B00149ILDO,Alderaan,"The Saboteur is set in Nazi infested Paris during World War II. Irishman Sean Devlin, the protagonist, joins the Resistance to end Nazi occupation in France. Devlin is loosely based on William Grover Williams, a French Grand Prix racer as well as a member of the Special Operations Executive back in the WWII era. The SOE was an organization who would sabotage Nazi equipment and assist local Resistance.

Gameplay for the Saboteur is similar to the GTA series: it has an extremely open world. Most of the map takes place in Paris, while there is also two small towns in Germany. In addition, you can do side missions and ""free play targets"" (such as use dynamite to blow up tanks, Nazi sniper nests, rockets, AA guns, kill Gestapo generals, etc.) as well as do main story missions. Every building in Paris can be climbed, often leading to free play targets or hatches to hide from Nazis. Climbing is kind of like Uncharted but more advanced. It will take time getting used to, but when you finally do, you'll find yourself climbing and jumping/ziplining from building to building just as often as driving to get around. There is also a stealth system similar to that of the Hitman games as well. You can sneak behind Nazis and snap their neck, then disguise yourself as a Nazi to access otherwise restricted areas. The combat system is also really good: you can punch, kick, and throw Nazis into other Nazis. There  are also around 50 cars to collect. Once you collect a car, you can drive it at any time by going to one of the garages. There are also black market dealers throughout Paris where you can buy an awesome arsenal of guns, including a Tommy gun, silenced handgun, silenced SMG, sniper rifles, bazookas, etc.

The Saboteur also features a Sin City esque environment: the game is in black and white, but certain colours show up (such as blood, Swastika coat of arms, people's irises, etc.) By completing certain missions, you will increase Resistance presence in a particular area, thus decreasing Nazi occupation and restoring colour. The soundtrack for the game is also perfect to set the mood. It makes you feel like you're actually in the 40's! I'm a huge metalhead, and I loved the music so much, I downloaded the full soundtrack via youtube converters.

The story could not have been any better if they tried. Sean almost won first place in a Grand Prix tournament, but lost because Nazi colonel Dierker cheated by shooting his tire. Enraged, Sean and his best friend Jules follow Dierker and drive his car into the river. Dierker captures the two men, and tortures and kills Jules, leading to Sean making a vow for revenge on Dierker and the Nazis. The main plot of the game is to hunt down and kill Dierker. The end of the game has a rather emotional feel to it, instead of just being an extremely violent shoot out. Pandemic Studios really outdid themselves for their final game, before EA (who bought Pandemic a few years prior to The Saboteur) shut them down. Pandemic spent tons of money and put hours and hours into making a game based on the Dark Knight movie, however. EA costed hundreds of jobs with this greedy decision.

Only downside to this game is that EA shut down the online servers. Although online gameplay never existed, it prevents gamers from using the Midnight Club DLC, provided with every copy of the game. Fortunately, no trophies are associated with the DLC. The only features of the Midnight Club (from my understanding) is ability to show nudity, a hotel room where Sean meets up with hookers, and a new car.",Wonderful game!,1420588800,4,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

They never just ask a boring question in a plain way; you always have to figure out what the question is REALLY asking, which adds a fun layer to a trivia game, and it makes you feel even more clever when you get the answer right. It's also more than fair that they added this challenge, seeing how only one player can buzz in and get it right, so they only expect one person out of your group of two or three players to actually get it.

I'd recommend any You Don't Know Jack game to anyone who even remotely likes trivia (and is at least 13 years old!!), so this isn't a bad game to add to your PS1 game collection. If you're trying to get all the YDKJ games, add this one in as well!

YDKJ for PS3, Xbox 360, and Wii is from 2011, so that's also not too bad when it comes to time and relevancy.

5.0,False,"05 2, 2009",A2R8DQN388EHB5,B000UU3SVI,M. Gaskill,"Fallout and Fallout 2 were some ground breaking games.  They were amazing additions to the wonderous variety of open end (sandbox) type Role Playing Games.

Fallout 3 is no different.  Now a first person shooter with the option for second, Fallout 3 is definately related to it's siblings.  Even though Bethesda purchased the rights to Fallout they did not screw up this game with unfamiliar aspects.  This game very much feels like Fallout and is much deserving of praise.

Like every game though there are a few problems.  For Fallout 3 this is mostly bugs and a few gaming concerns of mine, nothing really taking away from the awsome experience I had playing.

Pros:

1.  I love the sandbox style gaming.  Just like it's predecesors, Fallout 3 does not require you to stay on the main quest.  In fact most of the game are side quests and hidden missions along with hours of fighting, item collecting, skill honeing and plain fun.
2.  The Weapon selection while not extremely large is still very impressive.  Many melee weapons to choose from and a resepectable display of firepower with the guns and futuristic energy weapons.
3.  You now have your own house.  Fallout 3 has the options of owning your own house or penthouse with multiple themes and house add-ons.  Definately a supper plus and new addition to this game series.
4.  Downloadable content.  Fallout three already has addon missions that can be downloaded with also the promise of more.
5.  This game is definately set up for endless sequels and expansions.
6.  Specialized weapons.  I really like the idea of the blueprints used to create the special weapons.  The repair skills and the weapons combining was also a pleasant addition.

Cons:
1.  This game can be short.  Don't get me wrong this game in no way is short.  The main storyline is great but the main mission is rather short.  I understand the other games in the fallout series were like this but it seemed I was halfway through the game in my first sitting until I sidetracked from the main quest to do side missions.  Not a bad one but something I was concerned with.  However the downloadable content has reassured me this game will have fresh playtime constantly.
2.  Small gameworld.  Fallout 3 is based on Bethesda's Oblivion engine and really shows this in the game world.  The game map is only slightly larger than Elder Scrolls Oblivion's.  The map is of course large enough to enjoy but I found it lacking as there were only two fairly large towns and the first one you run across has the chance of being blown up by your character.  I felt better about this concern when it was revealed new towns will be added in future downloads.  ""The Pit"" being the newest.
3.  I was slightly disappointed with the weapons.  I think there is a great variety but it seems the melee weapons greatly outnumbered the projectile weapons.  It seemed Fallout 1 and 2 had a greater number of weapons.  Like my other cons this problem is solved with downloadable content.
4.  I was also a little disappointed you could not have more followers.  It seemed in Fallout 2 I had three followers helping me out with the fighting.  I am sure there is a logical explanation for limting the followers to one and your pet Dogmeat.  Not a real downer but a tiny disappointment anyway.

Even though I had a few concerns about this game it seems Bethesda has done great with bringing out new content in the form of downloads and expansions.  I apploud this idea and give this game five stars instead of the four I was going to give until I discovered the downloadable content.

Again Bethesda has really done a great job in giving gamers another fallout and also following up with expansions and addons that should make this game stay in the light for years to come.  The possibilities of endless involvement in the Fallout world has been open and Bethesda deserves an A for excellent game mastering.

Overall Game Play - 9/10

This is an amazing prequel to the Tomb Raider series and in my opinion is probably the best game out for the PS4! The puzzles were challenging but not so challenging that they ruin the game experience. Graphics are amazing, there were a few times when the game went to a cut scene and when it went back to Lara Croft it took me a minute to realize that the cut scene was over and I was back to playing! The player has the choice of whether they want to be stealthy or go for a full on assault or something in between. Personally, there is nothing better than sneaking up on unsuspecting enemies!

The online play is terrible, I would definitely not get this game for that! You have to wait forever for the game to find enough people for a match and once you manage to make it into a match if people drop out it just shuts you down and says that there are not enough people for the match. I don't think I was ever able to finish a match! Personally I don't care about online play which is why this did not affect my rating at all, I just know that there are a lot of people who do enjoy online play so I thought I would mention it.

My only real complaint (and it is a small one) was the voice audio. Sometimes I could not hear the voices at all and had I not had the subtitles on I never would have knew there was dialogue happening. This is a small problem because it is easily fixed by turning subtitles on. I loved this game and would recommend it to any fan of the adventure genre!

5.0,False,"08 27, 2010",A3OOIS6U00QJJX,B001D7T2VM,Dev,"I feel so very sorry for this game. Why? Because this is a great game, people just don't know about it. Even I didn't know about it until I played 60 min demo through Playstation Network (also available on 360). In demo they allow you to play through a whole ""dungeon"" (a huge level). Once I played it, I liked it so much that I had to play the whole game. Now that I have finished the game once, here is what I think about it.

Pros.

CREATIVELY DESIGNED WORLD: The thing that I liked the most about this game is it consists of 6 huge ""dungeons"" (huge stages like in Zelda games) connected with by a even bigger open world. Each of these dungeons is very creatively designed with plenty of puzzles (don't worry not boring ones). They can very from greenery filled open fields, destroyed towns, beautiful swamps, gothic towers, magma caves, deserts and more. Such variety in stages really encourages you to explore more and move forward in the game so you can unlock more stages. Just loved it.

TONS OF WEAPONS: You start out with just a sword, but then you can purchase, find and unlock A LOT MORE short, mid and long rage weapons as you progress in the game (such as deadly scythe, gauntlet, revolver etc.). Furthermore, anything you see lying on the ground can also be used as weapon (Cars, pipe etc.). Also, certain weapons such as shuriken can target multiple enemies and objects. Their creative use is a MUST to progress through the game. All of these weapons can be leveled up and customized (by use or purchase) which adds a great RPG element to this game.

INTRIGUING GADGETS: Other than weapons you will also obtain variety of gadgets in this game. Some of these gadgets are horn, grapple chain and a HORSE (YES THERE IS HORSE RIDE IN THIS GAME). There are some cooler gadgets that are unlocked toward end. Really don't want to spoil it for you, but if you want a hint look at the title of this review. Creative use of gadget is required to progress through the game.

INTIMIDATING BOSSES: Each dungeon has a mini bosses and when you get through the whole dungeon, you are presented with very imaginatively designed MAJOR BOSS. Let me tell you one thing. These bosses are no push over. Beating them takes combination of skills and creative thinking. I personally enjoyed battle with each of them (almost all of them, except one).

DIVERSITY IN ENEMIES: A lot of heck and slash these days have the same looking enemies from the beginning to the end. Fortunately, this game offers variety of different enemies. When I speak diversity, I am not taking about size, shape and color, but also strategy required to beat them. If you just go around button mashing, you won't go anywhere. A lot of these enemies require you to dodge, block and perform certain stunts (for example light your shuriken with fire and then hit them with it) to critically hit them.

FANTASY NOVEL LIKE STORY: While all may not enjoy it, this game has a deep, unique and suspenseful novel like story. You have angles, demons, guardians and what not. I would describe more, but don't want to spoil it for you.

AWESOME VOICE ACTING: While the central character is a bit dry (for a reason), all the others have done wonderful job (especially a character that is your colleague). I don't know the particular names, but some Hollywood grade actors are doing voice acting, so you won't be disappointed in this area.

CONS:

FEELS LOW BUDGET AT POINTS: While the most of the game looks gorgeous because it is competing with games such as God of War 3, at points it will feel cheap. However, don't get me wrong, for most part it will amaze you.

DIAPPOINTED BY FINAL BOSS: While all the other bosses are SPECTACULAR, the final boss was somewhat disappointing. I truly can't tell you much without spoiling.

GOOD STUFF IN THE END: I am talking about gadgets. Some of the best gadgets are given to you in the very end. I truly wish I could have had them earlier.

CONCLUSION:

Contrary to minor cons, this game has a lot to offer as it takes the best games out of popular games such as Zelda, Devil May Cry, God of War and Portal (YES PORTAL).

The buttons are intuitively placed and plentiful. The thumb portion swings out and forward and back via an onboard Allen wrench. I added weight to it via extra solid iron bits I have in an old toolbox.

About the Precision Aim feature, any serious FPS gamer will love it. Assign your ""Scope-In"" command to it, and when you hold it down, it adjusts your on-the-fly DPI to somewhere below 500 (customizable). Makes shooting faces much more efficient. The only ways that it would be better, would be to re-assign the feature to any key (RMB for most FPS junkies), and give it a toggle feature for those who toggle their scope. Now, I won't shoot faces without that feature.

The only gripe that I have with it is in the Precision Aim button. For a button used as frequently and as important as ""Scope-In"", it is small, recessed, and somewhat insensitive. This button should be huge and Hyper-Sensitive! Not to mention that the ""Precision Aim"" feature should be wholly remappable to any key that you wish, as nearly all of the keys on this mouse are. They fixed the physical deficiencies of this button in its successor (MadCatz MOUS), but they scrapped a lot of the physical customizations that make this one ooze the awesomesauce.

Being creative, as I am, I have an easy fix for the physical deficiencies of the Precision Aim button. You will need a standard paper hole punch, some scissors, a small piece of that 3M double-sided foam tape, and a half-inch rubber or plastic foot (like you find on the bottom of most electronics). Punch a hole in the foam tape, peel the upside wax strip off, center and attach the foot over the hole, trim the extra foam tape from around the diameter of the foot, peel the other wax strip, and apply to the PA button. Don't press it too firmly against the PA button, as this will cause it to become even less sensitive. Let it set for a couple hours before use, as the foam tape will adhere more strongly as it cures over time.

5.0,False,"02 21, 2011",A3OZY0SCKSXQ64,B00434FED2,andrew806,"For many people, Michael Jackson is the greatest pop star in history. With a career spanning more than 40 years, his songs, dances, and electric on-stage persona are the stuff of legend. While Michael Jackson: The Experience doesn't succeed in offering particularly deep gameplay, it manages to capture the magic that made Michael such a legend of the pop world, with great routines set to some of his biggest hits. Unpredictable motion controls, and the lack of both a career mode and any meaningful bonus content, detract from the experience. If you're a Michael Jackson fan and have a group of friends to play with, you'll have some fun dancing to his classic songs, but unpredictable motion controls will put a kink in your moonwalk
Michael Jackson: The Experience is extremely easy to pick up and play; up to four people can dance together, picking from of one of 26 of Jackson's hits. To play, you simply hold the Wii Remote in your right hand and replicate the actions of a virtual dancer onscreen. You're awarded points based on movements tracked by the Wii Remote, with each successful move being scored as bad, OK, good, or perfect. A score bar on the left of the screen fills up as you perform, hitting star markers along the way. Depending on how many stars you hit, you're awarded a star score at the end of each song, showing you how well you performed. Sadly, the game isn't great at recognizing your movements, and you often encounter moments of frustration as you wonder why you're not being scored correctly. However, this isn't too significant when you're performing because no matter how few points you get, it's impossible to fail out of a song.
This can be quite beneficial because the choreography is very difficult. Most routines are based on those in Michael's music videos, with a few original creations inspired by his dancing thrown in too. Signature moves, such as high kicks, toe stands, and moonwalks, all make an appearance and are extremely tricky to replicate if you're not blessed with Michael's skills. You do have the option of performing as one of the backing dancers, who have less-complicated moves, but this is only available on a limited number of tracks. Despite the difficulty, songs are a blast to perform, with the famous routines from ""Thriller"", ""Beat It"", and ""Billie Jean"" particular highlights. Playing with friends just adds to the fun because it's hilarious to watch them take part, and friends sitting it out can sing along with the lyrics displayed onscreen. Fans will be pleased to see most of his celebrated back catalogue in the game, including songs from his Motown days, such as ""Rock With You"" and ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough."" From the '80s, ""Bad"" and ""Smooth Criminal"" are available, as well as more recent songs, such as ""Ghost"" and ""Money.""",NOT good,1298246400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

5.0,True,"12 25, 2013",A3TG0T00XH7YUQ,B003O6ECOM,Hilda,"This game exceeded my expectations after I bought it for $10.  There is finally a story in this game.  While it may not be the best and may only be a timed sequences where you press a button to perform an action during a scene like Heavy Rain, it still is good.

Graphics:  Excellent.  The Frostbite 2 engine in this game that they use for the Battlefield series really shows.  Colors are bright, saturation is balanced, and lighting is, of course with this engine, spectacular.

Sound:  I knew the sound would be excellent from the start.  I am using a home theatre system, and the cars sound GREAT.  Some of the cars that you know should sound mean, sound...mean.  This may be a small thing, but even the tire screeching impressed me.  It is not overly annoying like in Gran Turismo.  The sound perfectly matches the attempts the car tries to get a grip of the road when you turn.  The music choice is excellent too.  Strolling through the country side and transitioning into country is some kind of upbeat pop country, really heightens the tension.

Gameplay:  As cars blaze upwards in a series of streets in an incline only found in San Fransisco, the car doesn't stay LASER STRAIGHT.  If you pay attention, the car actually slightly moves left and right in an attempt to regain traction with the car.  Great realism!  The handling of the cars is also impressive because it is more realistic than previous Need for Speeds.  No turning on a dime doing 100mp around a corner.  You can still do that, but still takes a little skill.  The car choice in this game is a little overwhelming.  Not only do you have supercars like Murcielago, but some standard cars too.  Sound familiar?  Need for Speed Underground has this kind of car selection, because sometimes you need to relate yourself to the typical driver, not to some millionaire who affords a Ferrari, as well as the police somehow...My favorite car, the Nissan GT-R is in this game too.  NOW, considering there is actually a story line in this game, expect guns.  The opening scene has people shooting at your car, yes shooting.  Some of you might be skeptical.  ""Guns in a NFS game?""  Let me remind you that the famous movie Fast and the Furious wasn't just about racing, it had a storyline too with GUNS in it.  So what if there are guns?  The more guns, if you ask me, the more there is an actual story line, rather than the typical Need for Speed ""I need to make a name for myself by working through the ranks"" story.

In conclusion:  This game is like a racing game and an action movie combined into one.  If you want to play Need for Speed Pursuit where you go 500mph and have police chasing you at those speeds and have to crash through a police blockade at those speeds sustaining little damage, so ahead.  I'll be right here soaking up the game that is as close as you can get to the Fast and the Furious movie, as close as you can get to an action movie, and as close as you can get to some sort of realism involved.","Need for Speed, finally...with a story",1387929600,5,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The graphics are detailed to such a degree that it is actually worth zooming in on battle, (not just for fun) as flames blast out of damaged ships. It's actually easier to judge a ships health from it's seared off armor and internal fires than a health bar!

Gameplay itself is traditional homeworld, with the ability to pan and some other balances. This makes movement on the screen effortless. 3d movement is easy to master, and really gives a sharp tactical feel to the game...

On balance, both sides are equal in power, and they are different enough to be truly separate races. (Not just 3rd tier new unit)

The campaign slowly but surely increases its difficulty as you grow. So while you while you may encounter difficult missions, they aren't over your head. The story is interesting, though I HIGHLY suggest playing Homeworld 1 first.

On Online play, it's just as great. Also, with the plethora of MODS (game modifications) out there you can enhance the already great essence of the game.

Some MODS of note: Star Wars Warlords, a Kadeshi Mod, a Star Trek mod, a Battlestar Galactica Mod, and a Descent Freespace Mod. (Only Star Wars Warlords is a real name. The other MODS are real, but I can't remember their names.  [...].",GREAT!,1152057600,,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

The one I am using is finally breaking (the plastic used to connect the leather headband to the earphones is breaking after heavy use). I tried a number of other headsets and a lot of them are USB, or SIMULATED surround sound.  I even put down $160 to try a wireless headset.  (Btw, if you need wireless, the best one out there is the Creative Soundblaster World of Warcraft headset - insanely expensive but very good.)

This is the best surround sound I have experienced in a headset as it actually has 8 speakers and the mini-plugs for each channel.  You DO need a 5.1 capable sound card (most Mobos have them standard now anyway) but it's well worth it.

This version does not use USB and so ignore those people complaining about static.  It is as clear as your soundcard is capable of.  It's the same as plugging in a surround sound speaker set.  It is durable, comfortable for hours of game play, actually helps a LOT in games to hear people around you (I can track footsteps anywhere around through walls in MW2) and is amazingly dirt cheap at only $70 right now.  Buy this, you won't be disappointed.  I'm returning my way too expensive wireless set for this one...It's better sound at $100 cheaper.

-It includes a splitter so you can plug your speakers in as well with no fiddling with plugs.  It has adjustable volume for each speaker and sub in the line.

I've read other reviews that are knocking the game's short length and lack of options, but I think those people are missing the point of this game. This is not Civ for the PC. This is as close to pick-up-and-play Civ as you can get and still retain the deep level strategy aspect of it.

Some would argue that since it has been scaled down that it loses its deep strategy. I disagree. After all, chess is a game with only 64 square and 16 pieces but unlimited depth of strategy.

The graphics are more than good enough for a game like this. With this being a turn-based strategy I wasn't expecting much, so I actually think the animations are just overkill.

I do have some gripes. I would have liked the world to be bigger. I like the exploration aspect of the game and with its limited size, you've seen everything in the first hour or so. Also, I expected a greater variation of units, helicopters, jet planes, APCs, snipers, etc.

The wii has been able to involve workouts in a fun and comprehensive way that has made it much cheaper, fun and enticing than going to a gym.  If you were a little overweight and ashamed of going to the gym, or had a lack of time/ money to make it to the gym this is for you.

Controls

Wii balance board and remote.  The balance board is the best device i have ever seen constructed.  It works on carpets and on hardwood floors.  The board weighs you every day and is able to determine how much preasure you are placing from one foot to the other or how your balance is distributed.  While doing the exercises it shows you where your ideal balance should be placed and helps you align your body properly to get the most of your workout.  The wii remote is used for some tasks like running or jogging.  While in your pocket or in your hand it can determine how fast you are moving just by it being on you. 5/5

Graphics

The graphics are typical wii 3d graphics.  Nothing above the ordinary but what you should be expecting.  If you go for a jog and take an island lap you see a very pretty island with the water along your side.  Its enough scenery to keep you running because you want to see it all.  The side games like balance and skiing look pretty good. 4/5

Gameplay

You get Aerobics, Strength, yoga, fitness, and minigames all in one.  Personally they are all fun to do.  Aerobics and strength are my favorites.  If you want a break you can cool off with some yoga and or minigames to work on your balance.
-Aerobics you can do jogs walk up and down on the balance board and do some boxing along with other things.
-Strength you can do crunches, pushups, twists and so on.  These are the workouts people dread but they are executed flawlessly and actually add fun to the game.  As you start out you might have a task to do 10 crunches.  As you do this and complete this task a few times then a new version of 20 crunches will appear. And it will go up further and further untill you get to a challenge mode which lets you go 1 on 1 with your trainer to see who can do more of the task before quitting.  This is the real challenger right here.
-Yoga you get simlar yoga poses like the half crescent, or the tree.  You are required to keep your balance while preforming these poses and giving deep inhales and exhales.  The board measures even the slightest movement in your balance and encourages you to do better and better every time.  This is more relaxing and can be used pretty well inbetween things like running and crunches to give your body some cool off time.
-Games are there to help you learn how to balance and align your body properly for other various activites in wii fit.  Some tasks might require you to balance on the board to move marbles around.  Or even move a character around an obstacle maze with the balance on the board.  The games add some fun and excitement to the game and are a nice breakaway from working out.

5/5 for gameplay.

All and all the wii fit is a recommendation for everyone.  Adults and kids alike will have fun enjoy themselves and keep in shape.  You are given a personal trainer that guides you through your workouts.  At the beginning you get a body test that measures your weight and determines what your body mass is.  Then you are allowed to determine what you want to accomplish with your weight, within a certain time line.  You can set goals for yourself that include loosing poundage, gaining pounds or staying in the same weight class.  You can then check in on your goals every day and see how your overall weight control has been going on a daily basis.  On a side note there is a clock that measures how much time you have invested each day.  When the clock hits 30 minutes you have reached your daily goal and it will tell you.  On a side note the game is designed to warn you when you have worked out for an hour time.  Once you hit the 1 hour mark it gives you a notice that asks you to take a 10-15 minute break and drink some water.  This is a great tool and encourages people to not overdo it.",Wii = Fun,1256860800,,,

I thought this game was awesome. Especially the beginning, Forest Of Silence! The music and sound effects are great and the game story is good. The controls may take a while to get used to but if you like games with a challenge, get this. I think that fighting skeletons gets boring after a while but I think when you get to higher levels, (I'm not sure of this) there will be more vicious enemies to fight for your pleasure. I thought the game could have been a little more...well....diverse and detailed, but where I am now, is awesome! I have to say, I bought this at Fucoland and I had no idea I would like it this much. I rented it once before and I hated it because it was so hard. Really, I just didn't put my mind to it and look where I am now. I'm in the 1st castle! This is a great action-RPG game that will keep you hooked for hours. I would recommend that 10 and up should play this game because of the theme and the bloody scenes. There isn't much of a story to this game but for me, that's okay. But for serious gamers (I think I am but this game is so good that I don't really care about the story) you might be a little ticked off because of the lack of story. There many levels for you to get through and they all take a long time. The Forest Of Silence took me about 3 hours to figure everything out (no cheats no guide no nothing). There are two charaters to chose from. Reinhart and a girl (I forgot her name). Now Reinhart has a sword and a whip to fight off enemies and to destroy other things. I think he is better than the girl because he has a stronger weapon. The girl has a energy ball that takes 2 seconds to charge up. I don't like that because if an enemy is comming towards you, you have to charge. She also has these two....rings they look like. She uses that to slice things, just like Reinhart's sword. There are two modes you can go through. Easy and Normal. Normal is not that hard but there is quite a difference between that and easy. There are some options that you can do like the controls and stuff. As I mentioned before, their isn't much of a storyline but when you start the game, there is some. So that makes the game better. Be prepared to do a lot of jumping.

I have been playing games since the old Intellvision days and I must say this will be one of my favorites to keep in my collection.  I enjoyed it a lot more than the GTA games mainly due to the fighting and in my opinion a better story. The fighting mimics the Batman games and I found myself often going out of my way to fight at the fight clubs to try new moves. Driving was fun, sometimes frustrating, but I must admit thrilled when I won a race. I liked the arcade feel of driving.  The side quests were entertaining and a nice diversion.

I must admit I would have liked to see tougher enemies with different fighting styles and character models.  Instead of using the same enemy types over and over again. Some other little cons are the in game GPS which can be frustrating as it does not always guide you on the shortest and direct path.  Also the mini surveillance camera game should have mixed it up with different character models instead of using the same character model that you picked over and over again.  It could have been more engaging as you should have watched the deal going down and then select the person to arrest with different character models.

Pros:
-Fighting system
-Upgrade system
-Arcade races
-Story
-Environmental hazards

Cons:
- In game GPS system sometimes frustrating
- Same character models recycled
- Repetitive surveillance camera game
- Same fighting moves with enemies need more diversity with fighting style and character models.
- Camera view will sometimes flake out when driving around corners or backing up in traffic.  Drive straight for a moment and the camera will correct itself.

The gameplay is your standard FPS fare, nothing new or boundary pushing in Singularity.  The story is interesting, I like the sci-fi elements.  There are too many ""war"" FPS games out there so Singularity fills the void nicely.

Over the course of the game, you receive a Time Manipulation Device, or TMD.  As you play, your TMD is upgraded with powers such as slowing down time, reverting enemies into creatures that go on a rampage, picking up and throwing objects around the environment, and using TMD power as a thruster to knock back and harm enemies and objects.

I like the variety of enemies in this game.  You have Russian troops coming after you as well as different types of mutated humans as a result of the explosion and E99.  Enemies use a variety of weapons and the mutants can throw exploding barrels at you.

The graphics in the game are average, similar to the ""war"" type FPS games where objects and textures appear somewhat blurry/pixelated when you stand next to them.  It's nothing serious and it didn't affect my enjoyment of the game at all.

There are a number of different weapons, your standard rifle and shotgun, pistol, grenade launcher (with a remote controlled rolling bomb secondary attack), sniper rifle, and more, I don't want to give away everything.  Each weapon's clip capacity, reload speed, and damage can be upgraded twice using weapon kits you find in various places around the levels.  First level upgrades require one kit, 2nd require 2.

Scattered everywhere in the game is E99, an element used in everything in this alternate reality.  You collect various containers of it and it's used as a currency to purchase different upgrades such as carrying more health packs, using health faster, longer sprint, more oxygen for swimming, extra weapon precision, and what not.  These different upgrades must be found on blueprints around the levels.  They are generally easy to spot but there are a few that you may pass by.

Overall Singularity is an extremely underrated game.  I'm sad that it hasn't sold more copies because Raven is a good developer.  I thought that by sharing my opinions of the game, I can sway people to check it out.  I've put about 8 hours into the game and I'm not finished yet.  I still have another chapter and a half or so.

I will not be touching on the censorship of the fans as I find it had zero impact on the quality of the game, which is the only thing I care about.

The game is great...borderline amazing. I'm not sure I've ever played an rpg where everything works like this game. The characters work, the mirages work, the j-pop idol theme works, the dungeons work, and most importantly, the battle system works. In fact, the battle system is one of my all time favorites, and it's always fun. Playing on hard mode requires real thought and execution to take down powerful enemies, and that's when the game really shines. Sure, I could play on normal and fly through the game, using session links over and over again with little worry about my health and buffs. But to me, that would be stale. Hard mode forces me to use everything, health, buffs, recarns(lots of these), defense, charges. It feels like old RPGs where beating bosses was an accomplishment. Yep, hard mode is where it's at!

The unity adds even more depth to what is already a deep game, and there are even class changes. This game oozes charm and is everything an rpg fan could ever want. I wasn't sure about the theme of the game from the start, but it's grown on me. Watching Tsubosa and Kiria and Itsuki and all the rest grow in their professions(while becoming more efficient battlers) is truly interesting and heartwarming at times. What else can I say, I can't recommend this game enough. It's simply one of the best RPGs I've ever had the pleasure of playing.","It's gold, Itsuki!

The PlayStation button works just the same as any playstation device, pressing the button brings you to the main menu, and holding it brings up the options for the system (IE the brightness, wifi settings, etc.).

As for the actual physical design, it's not too bad. It's one of the few electronic devices that the developers actually used their brains and put the speakers on the front of the device. They could be louder, but if they're not loud enough you can just use earphones. With earphones it's more of a normal volume level. The triggers are springy and work well, as does the D-pad. The other four, the X, O, triangle and square, and the joysticks, are a little small for my liking, but it is a portable system, so it makes sense. The screen is big, bright, and vibrant. The back touchpad works well, and while I wish the back handholds were a little bigger, it still works fine. Battery life isn't incredible, but for basically being a portable PS 2.5, it's great. The device has enough weight to it to feel solid without being too heavy. The camera kind of sucks, but hey, it's still there. One thing that I wish they incorporated, or that was able to be incorporated with an external case, is that with normal game controllers, you have both of the triggers. The L2 and R2 triggers help me balance the controller in my hand and use L1 and R1 more efficiently. I know that there couldn't be a case that would incorporate additional triggers, but I wish that at least you could have a case that would extend plastic below the triggers so that I could rest my middle fingers on it, to balance the vita better in my hand. If that makes any sense... It's kind of hard to explain without any visuals. Lol.

I have the 3G version, but the 3G is a joke. First off, you can't play any games online on 3G. You would have wayyyyyyy too much latency to play any sort of a shooter or competitive game. Over wifi you're totally fine. But secondly, it's way too expensive. I don't remember exact prices off of the top of my head, but I want to say it's like 20 or 30 bucks for 250mb of data. 250mb of data that is ridiculously slow. Like what? Come on. At least incorporate 4G, or don't charge anywhere near as much. But it is still cool that technology is getting to the point where you can do that with a gaming device.

I only have two games, the PlayStation Allstars, and Uncharted. Allstars doesn't really use the rear touchpad, but Uncharted does, and I have to say that I really like how it's incorporated. The touchpad, both front and rear, and like the motion detection is used in a way where you're not being forced to use it every 5 seconds, but you still get the use out of it. I've always thought incorporating touch screens into gaming was a bit of a gimmick, it's not my favorite, but so far it's been incorporated in a way where it's not overbearing, but you still get your use out of it. I really like how it's been used so far.

Now, for my favorite thing, the remote play. It is as cool as people say it is. If someone is using the TV, you can stream any game from your PS4 straight to your vita. You can even do it on someone else's WiFi, as long as your PS4 is in standby mode. How awesome is that? When streamed, the games look amazing. I don't know how the specifics work with the resolutions and everything, but it looks exactly like it does on the PS4, it doesn't tone down the resolution or anything. One of my favorite things though, is that you can press the PlayStation button and click on the option ""Button Mapping"", which will completely map the PS4 game's controls on the vita controls. Another really cool thing is that the ""Start"" and ""Select"" buttons work as the ""Share"" and ""Options"" buttons respectively, so you can still use the Share function and capture the awesome moments from the vita. Like that's amazing!! I know that a lot of people had problems using remote play with the PS3, and I think that's because they made the vita after the PS3, so they weren't really able to incorporate that functionality into the PS3. I'm glad that they worked more with it on the PS4. To me, using the vita for the menu of the PS4 is laggy, but once you get into the game there isn't any lag at all. It really is amazing what technology has come to.

Anyways, I think I covered everything I meant to. Obviously everyone is going to have their own opinion, and since I've gotten older I haven't as much as a flair for portable gaming as I used to, but I'm really enjoying the vita so far. But I think it's especially awesome if you have a PS4, they really made all of the features work extremely well together, and I've been really pleased with the responsiveness of everything. Let me know in the comments if you want to know about other features, or if something I said didn't make sense! :)",Playstation Vita - Amazing accessory for the PS4,1406505600,,,

Just repeating the review I posted on the other X52 Pro:

I bought this joystick for a friend in Brazil in dec of 2006. He plays frequently and never had a problem.
It was love at first sight. I didn't want to give him the first unit and I couldn't buy myself one at that time, however I finally bought mine.
Installation in Windows XP was easy and painless.

Didn't have a single problem, I downloaded the newest driver and programing software from Saitek (I didn't use the CD). Installed them, plugged the Joystick and all worked.

I think that the customizable lights (thee options) in each button are very neat. I have mine to play falcon AF, which has lots of different functions and the different colors help me remember the functions of the buttons.

PROS:
-very customizable
-feels like well built
-a friend has used it for a long time and never had problems. I have mine for 2 weekends and no problem whatsoever.
-has a 2 year warranty

CONS:
-Didn't find any so far. I will update this with time.","Same stick, better price also by Amazon..",1245196800,,,

5.0,False,"11 26, 2009",A2J3MR64L567OK,B000NJH6YG,Yossarian,"I'm late to the game with Two Worlds, but I was so disappointed with Dragon Age:  Origins that I found myself looking anywhere for a real RPG that is both playable and actually fun.  I took a chance on Two Worlds despite the poor reviews, and I am extremely happy that I did.

For the longest time while playing, I couldn't figure out what the game reminded me of.  And then it hit me:  Gothic/Gothic 2.  Two Worlds is extremely similar to both games, in everything from the way your character moves, to the equipment, to the magic items and spells, to the layout of the world itself.  This is a very good thing, as anyone who has played Gothic or Gothic 2 will tell you.  Some specifics:

Difficulty.  The game is indeed quite difficult.  Just like Gothic/Gothic 2, you can't simply run off into the woods and hope to survive.  You have to slowly work your way up by first picking off weaker creatures near the main roads, and build up both your levels and your equipment to survive the bigger encounters.  I recommend starting on ""Easy"" which is at least the equivalent to ""Normal"" in most games.  But one key consideration is missing from most other reviews:  dying is not really a punishment in this game.  If (and when) you die, you simple reincarnate at a nearby health shrine.  You don't lose experience, stats, or even any gold.  Moreover, you reincarnate at the nearest health shrine even if you haven't found it yet -- I've accidentally teleported onto the other side of a mountain range by dying and coming back at an undiscovered health shrine.  So the difficulty is not nearly as frustrating as it sounds because you can, if you have to, just die a lot to whittle down a tough monster.  Or lure them close to a mana or health shrine that will constantly power you up as you get hurt.  And when you eventually have that awesome platemail or greatsword and can start 1-shoting monsters that have been killing you for hours, the gratification level is HUGE.

Graphics.  The graphics are a little dated, but not nearly as bad as people say.  Some of the atmospheric effects, particularly fog, are very cool, and there are lots of pretty looking rivers and streams and sunsets to keep up the eyecandy level.  I'm running on 1080p HD and the graphics are as least as good as Dragon Age:  Origins -- despite being 2+ years older.

Gameplay.  This one of the places the game really shines.  There are lots of different ways to play this game.  You can be a warrior with a huge axe, an archer, a mage (with many different sub-types like Earth mage or Water mage to specialize in), an assassin, a hunter, a booby trap specialist, or some combination therein.  Combat is actually a lot of fun, and there's even a backstep/dodge button that works quickly and lets you avoid big hits from other monsters.  My preferred playstyle is to set a few explosive traps, pepper foes with arrows so they charge into those traps, and then smash them with a halberd or greatsword.  But you can also summon hell knights, cast lightning storms, trap foes in magical tentacles, or do almost anything else you want.

Loot.  There are tons and tons of items in this game.  You can customize your character with everything from rings (4 of them!) to armor to boots, to even an assassin knife you use only in backstabbing, or perhaps magic robes and a wizard's staff.  Items have a wide range of powers, but you can improve an item by combining it with an identical item.  This has many subtle effects, like letting you make mediocre equipment really powerful if it is common and you find it a lot, or letting you use something that looks awesome by ranking it up so it's better than the more powerful -- but uglier -- base item.  For example, I found a suit of white mirrored half-platemail that looks fantastic, but is a bit weaker than some other heavy plate.  By combining multiple sets of the white platemail, I both look good and have great armor protection.  Like Gothic 2, there are also tons of alchemy items you can find out in the woods, like mushrooms, flowers, gemstones, and the like.  Some have permanent effects, so you can quickly learn to make potions that give you permanent boosts to all your stats, or even your resistances or physical armor.  This is another great way to toughen up early in the game.

Plot.  The storyline is also entirely adequate.  The voice acting in most (but not all!) places is a little amateurish, but you can skip right through it with the press of a button.  The world map is gigantic and filled with villages, towns, castles, necromancer towers, crypts, graveyards, and everything else you'd want in a fantasy world.  There are tons of side quests, and you will always have something else to do.

Foes.  Another great thing about this game is the huge range of enemies.  You will face all the standard enemies from skeletons to zombies to wolves, but how about death knights, wyverns, dragons, giant scorpions, and even huge preying mantises?  Or perhaps a cave full of enraged dwarves, or huge half-demon half-snake monsters?  Enormous flesh, stone, or wood golems?  Huge orc encampments?  The possibilities are nearly endless, and there are always treasure chests and loot to be found.  Your enemies don't scale much as you level so you can go back and punish them later, but some of their inventory does scale so it is always worth checking to see what they carried.

There is a lot more that can be said about this game (both archery and booby trap setting deserve their own entries) but some things should be experienced directly.  In my opinion as a long-time gamer, this game has been unfairly maligned and should be given another close look.  If you have ever played Gothic or Gothic 2, you will find this game very similar -- and a heck of a lot of fun.

5.0,False,"11 9, 2013",A36NMMVWY6BP1V,B006OI3CTS,evani1997,"The mega-popular Kingdom Hearts series has been going on for ten years, continually giving fun games with interesting stories. As unusual as the Disney-meets-Final Fantasy concept is, the series has become one of the most popular modern RPG franchises. The latest entry in the series, Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance, is a challenging yet enjoyable game. The new flowmotion mechanic, dream spirits, and colorful worlds make Kingdom Hearts 3D the all-around best game in the series thus far!

The story of Kingdom Hearts 3D picks up where the game Kingdom Hearts Re: Coded left off. The protagonist Sora and his friend Riku need to prove themselves as true masters of the keyblade, a key-like weapon that is used throughout the series. To do this, they must rescue worlds that are lost in slumber by unlocking the keyholes found in the worlds. The story is interesting, but it gets complex. There are some things that take place later in the story that I still don't fully understand. However, unlike many other games, you can actually understand most of this story without playing the other games in the series first (although I would recommend playing the others). This is because the game comes with a glossary that defines key elements in the series, and also with a section called Chronicles that tells the basic plots of the previous games in the series.

The play style for this game is the best in the series. It maintains the elements that made the series so great, and adds more to it. As with the other games, you go to several worlds fighting enemies in real time battles. Fighting enemies gives you experience points which, when enough are gained, will allow you to level up. You also have deck commands, which let you do things like cast magic or do special attacks such as throwing the keyblade.

In the game, you play both Sora's and Riku's stories. Both characters have a drop meter that depletes as you play. When the meter runs out, you switch to the other character's story. This is called ""dropping."" You can also manually drop by pausing the game and tapping the drop button on the touch screen. The problem with dropping is that unless you manually drop regularly, you can end up dropping in the middle of a fight or boss battle. If you drop in the middle of a boss, you have to restart the battle when you drop again.

The main element that makes Kingdom Hearts 3D so great is the new flowmotion mechanic. Flowmotion allows you to dash into a wall, a pole, or other object and perform either an extended dash or special attack to have your character interact with objects in unique ways. Some things this lets you do is grind on rails and spin around large enemies. When used in combat, the flowmotion mechanic creates very flashy battle sequences.

Another new addition to the series are the dream spirits. Dream spirits replace your usual teammates of Donald Duck and Goofy, and they resemble animals such as dogs and bats. You can raise your dream spirits like pets by naming, petting, and painting them different colors. You can also put them in tournaments against other dream spirits. Depending on what kind of dream spirits are on your team, you can equip different upgrades to your character such as health upgrades and attack boosts. I honestly think that the dream spirits are a great improvement over Donald and Goofy.

The final new feature that this game introduces is reality shifts. Reality shifts are special moves that either damage your enemies or help you get around in the worlds. These are activated when a purple icon appears on the enemy or obstacle, and you slide the stylus down on the touch screen. Another way to activate reality shifts is to press the X and A buttons at the same time. Reality shifts vary depending on the world you are in. Some include flinging objects like a catapult or making grind rails that allow you to reach other areas. Reality shifts range from average to really cool.

The graphics to the game are true to the other Kingdom Hearts games. The 3DS' graphics capabilities enable the game to look just like the PS2 games.

The worlds in this game look great! As with the previous Kingdom Hearts games, most of the worlds you visit are themed after Disney films. Aside from a world or two, all of the worlds are brand new. The worlds featured are colorful and unique.

Also, the 3D in the game works really well. Menu screens pop out, and when you use flowmotion, things appear to be flying out of the screen. Unlike most 3DS games, I actually enjoy playing this game in 3D.

The music in the game is excellent. Although some of the tracks are reused from previous games, there are still enough new songs to keep the soundtrack sounding fresh. The voices of the Kingdom Hearts exclusive characters, as well as all the other Disney characters, sound really expressive.

The controls in the game are simple. You run with the slide pad, jump with the B button, attack with the A button, roll with the Y button, and activate deck commands with the X button. You can scroll through commands with the directional pads and move the camera with the L and R buttons.

My criticisms for the game are few. My biggest complaint is that even though basic gameplay is challenging, boss battles get extremely frustrating sometimes. The flowmotion ability is usually the best strategy in these situations, but sometimes they cause you to die even more. When you level up enough, you can unlock an ability called ""Second Chance."" This move allows you to keep at least one HP when you die, which makes these bosses easier. As mentioned earlier, unless you manually drop regularly, you will probably drop in the middle of a fight or boss battle, which can get really annoying. My final complaint is that the dialogue sometimes gets really odd. For example, the line, ""Well, I guess the rules of the worlds don't apply when your hearts are connected"" makes the infamous ""lamers"" line in Kingdom Hearts II look like poetry.

Kingdom Hearts 3D is an incredible game and one of the best 3DS games out there. The gameplay is even better than the other Kingdom Hearts games, which is saying a lot because I loved the gameplay in the other games.  Because of the fast-paced flowmotion mechanic, the colorful new worlds, and the useful dream spirits, Kingdom Hearts 3D is to me the best game in the series.

Final Score: 9.1/10

5.0,False,"08 26, 2009",A2N60VDBR10N18,B001E8VB6O,Tyler Johnson,"Batman: Arkham Asylum is the best Batman game ever made. But that is not the reason that you should buy it. You should stop what you are doing and get this game immediately because it is one of, if not the best, game of the year. It excels in every category, and is alot of fun to play, a quality that is fast fading in this modern gaming age.
The game starts off with you escorting the Joker back to his home away from home in Arkham Asylum. Just before he can be safely stored in his padded room, all hell breaks loose and you are trapped on an island filled with your fiercest foes. The story only gets better from there, and you see villans ranging from Harley Quinn, to the Scarecrow in some of the most psycologicaly thrilling levels since Eternal Darkness.

The Graphics are gorgeous. Period. The voice acting is so good I go to geek heaven every time I hear Mark Hamill give us the greatest Joker laugh ever concieved. Many of the voice actors from the excellent Batman: The Animated Series reprise their roles in this game to great effect. Paul Dini penned the excellent story so have no fear, you will not be rolling your eyes at cliched dialogue the entire game. Think of this as one of the best episodes of the animated series ever.

As I stated in my title You are the Dark Knight, and it has never been this enjoyable. As Batman, you have at your disposal a wide array of gadgets ranging from your standard issue Batarang, to grappling hook, and blasting gel. Every item has a unique function, and often has combat applications for the more adventurous players. Which brings me to the combat. As Batman you have the ability to jump into a group of ten thugs and put generations of Jet Li and Jackie Chan movies to shame. After a few fights you should have the basic mechanics down, and by the time you have logged in a couple of hours you will be racking up 20 hit combos. There are times however, when you won't be able to charge into battle, but will need to use stealth, and badass scare tactics to defeat the more heavily armed foes. There are few things as satisfying as swooping down from the ceiling, tying your foe up, and leaving him to swing, scaring the crap out of the rest of his friends while the Joker taunts his men for their incompetence.

While the combat is fantastic, the area of the game that most impressed me was the exploration. In games past exploration was barely a sidequest and treated more as a distraction for after you had completed the game. In Arkham Asylum you have a ton of interesting things to find from awesome recordings of the villans psych evaluations to engravings chronicling Amadeus Arkhams slow descent into madness. While most games make you turn over every rock and look in every cranny in AA you can find maps that point out the approximate location of the items. And once you find said secrets you are rewarded with extra experience to boost your abilities.

The one gripe I have with the game is that you do not have a jump button. You jump automatically when you reach a ledge. While this seems like it would be a hindrance, in many case it is easier than a jump button. There are a couple of times I wished I had more control over my jump, but not to the point that it affected my performance.
The playstation three version allows you to use the joker in the challenge maps so if you own a ps3 get this for that.

Put your mind at ease if you're in the second camp like I was: Super Mario Galaxy 2 is everything I loved about the first one, plus better controls, more imagination, and more fun!

Some people complain about the cruder graphics on the Wii when compared to the other latest generation consoles, but the bottom line for me is that a game is either fun, or it isn't.  And SMG2 proves that Nintendo can still make games that are insanely fun, don't require blowing people's heads off, and maximize the graphics abilities the Wii does have.  The game looks fantastic, is easy to pick up, encourages continued play, and is so mind-blowingly creative that it's a shame other companies can't reach the same level.

Then they compalin about the defense. First of all they compalin about haivng auto fielding then they complain about fielding being too hard! Fielding is very easy.
The pitching is amazing. Every pitcher pitches exactly like they do in the Major League's. From Curt Schilling to Tom Glavine to Roger Clemens. They all pitch just like they actually do i the MLB. Also having hot and cold zones for each batter helps you get your opponents out much easier.
The hitting is also great. Last year it was impossible to score at all, but this year there's always a mix of pitching duels and games with a lot of runs. Hitting only takes the use of the joystick and one button unlike some other systems games where it takes 3 buttons to do one thing.
There are only a few things that bug me about this game 1) You are called out stealing a lot when you should bbe safe 2) After hitting a homerun wheter you're Sammy Sosa or Livan Hernandez they all run around pumping their fists int he air, no Sosa leap, no nothing. 3) Every once in a while you will hit several homeruns in a row, which leds to blow-outs against the computer 4) On rookie level you can see where the computer is going to pitch before they pitch, it is so easy I scored 22 runs before the ocmputer got an out

In Black Flag you take on the role of Edward Kenway, a Welsh-born privateer turned pirate and eventual member of the Assassin Order.  Kenway has travelled to the Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy in order to provide for his newly expecting wife.  Due to an unexpected turn of events Kenway turns towards a life of piracy and assassination in order to survive.  Kenway inadvertently becomes involved in the war between Templars and Assassin's which has been secretly waging for more than a millennium.  Here are my thoughts on Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag;

Pros

+ First Assassin's Creed game that delivers an open world experience.

+ Seamless transitions between navigation, naval combat, boarding ships and exploring islands with minimal loading screens.

+ Addictive gameplay makes you want to achieve 100% synchronization.

+ Engaging story that keeps you interested through the entire experience.

+ Unique and rewarding multiplayer mode.

+ Brilliant original score by award winning composer Brian Tyler.

+ Plenty of side activities to do alongside the main storyline.

+ Kingston, Havana and Nassau were all beautifully designed even though they felt a bit small.

+ Freeroaming gameplay was fun as always.

+ Gorgeous graphics as with all previous titles in the series.

+ Fast-paced ship to ship and melee combat.

+ No beggars!

Cons <Contains SPOILERS>

- Less variety in gadgets and utilities.

- No puzzles to solve or challenges to complete.

- Missions are slightly less varied than in previous releases with a bit too much emphasis on tailing missions.

- Story can meander and doesn't do much to advance the overall tale of the Assassin's Creed franchise.

- A few quirky camera issues, especially during naval combat when you're attempting to board enemy ships.

- Courtesans and fighters were of little use.

- Limited armor customization.

- Game crashed a few times while I was playing it.

- Story felt a bit short but the side activities lengthen the overall play time.

- Limited ship piloting.  Overall you primarily only pilot your own ship, the Jackdaw.

Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag is yet another solid release in Ubisoft's franchise. The introduction of Edward Kenway added a new and interesting character to the game as did the ability to fully pilot your own ship throughout the games story.  The game boasts beautiful graphics, a compelling story, engaging gameplay and delivers an open world experience unlike any of the previous releases.  I did feel at times the game tried a little too hard to be a ""pirate"" game rather than an Assassin's Creed title.  However, that being said Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag is sure to please the majority of fans of the franchise, especially if you enjoyed the ship aspects of Assassin's Creed III. I logged over 80 hours in this game and am eagerly looking forward to the next installment in 2014.",A spectacular sixth installment in the Assassin's Creed franchise,1388102400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
5.0,True,"02 8, 2003",A2UP4COAQ7UGBY,B00000I1BG,maninblue,"I actually did purchase this game two times.  I lent it out some years ago and never got it back. I recently noticed that the price is very modest so I picked it up again.  Why? This game is an older generation game (PS1), but it is better than some PS2 games I have played that only advertise graphics but have poor gameplay or short game time.  Tenchu is a satisfying game that lets you creep around, slice necks from behind, and hide out on rooftops. You will avenge the death of a crooked merchant, rescue a captive nijna, save a princess, destroy a fiendish cult, stop the spanish pirates, and fight a big boss with a bigger sword. Of course there are those who opppose this type of activity and thus will try to stop you.  Its lots of fun running around, hiding, killing from the unseen.  Its better while doing it while the great game soundtrack is playing.  This game has very catchy music that brings you you right in. The graphics, like I said, are mediocre, but that won't make or break a game anyway. Gameplay makes the game and this game has plently. Plenty of enemies to defeat, two selectable characters, a bunch of ninja items to utilize, and the percect amount of levels.
What isn't so good about the game? Each ninja only has a small amount of stealth kills to use. There are plenty of regular attacks to be diverse but only 3 stealthy kills. One kill is rarely used due to the fact that you have to be iun front of you r enemy to use it which is dangerous because he will see you. You usually do the neck slice (yawn).  Another downside is that many of the ninja items you acuire will be useless.  Since you can only carry 4, you will take ninja stars, bombs, paralyzing rice cakes, and the grapling hook.  The others are junk or rare objects recieved as bonuses for completing the missions on a master ninja score. Again the graphics are dated. The enemy AI is a pretty stupid. You can run past an ememy warrior and duck behind a bush or tree and he won't know where you went.  He will look around himself quick and resume his patrols, ""Where are you!?""
Its still a load of fun and can be a challenge at first to get a perfect rating and unlock secret items. Replay value is pretty darn good. You might get tired of it after beating it with both ninjas, but you will get a taste for it some time later.  This game will not sit in a closet.

the game is similar to an old arcade title named Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara from capcom. a 2d side beat em up scroll-er with rpg elements/ dungeon crawler.

5.0,True,"04 2, 2013",A283X7MG53SJ9V,B009DL02E6,K. Childers,"First off, I'd like to say that I've never played any of the other Saints Row games, nor had I heard of this series before discovering this.  I'd also like to say that I've played several of the GTA games and I generally dislike them, finding them to be boring after a few hours of play.  So Saints Row: The Third, being an obvious GTA clone, is a surprise hit for me for no other reason than that it succeeds in keeping me entertained and thus coming back for more.  At the time of writing this, I'm about 34 hours into the game and there's no reason to think that I won't be putting another 34 hours before I'm done.

Story:  You're the leader of a gang who is trying to wrestle power away from rival gangs in the fictional city of Steelport.  Who cares?

Gameplay:  This is where the SR shines.  The game has a way of rewarding you for every stupid notion that you have.  And even things that aren't meant to progress the story end up being huge time consumers, such as collecting and customizing one of every vehicle in the game.  Don't want to steal cars for yourself, then steal them for other people in the vehicle theft missions.  Get bored with that, then go take on a few assassination contracts.  Then go base jumping.  Then go see how many mascots you can find and kill.  Rob a few stores.  Take a few hostages on a joy ride while running from the police.  Get in a shootout with a rival gang over some territory.  Take a tank on a rampage through the city.  Buy some new clothes.  Find blow-up dolls hidden around the city.  Commit insurance fraud by getting yourself ran over.  Go streaking!  Yes, the game even keeps track of and rewards you for how long you run around naked.  And after you're done with all of that, you still have all of the story missions to play through, which are mostly of the ""bat-s*** crazy"" variety and include starring in a sci-fi movie, selling yourself into sex slavery in order to infiltrate a rival gang's HQ, and chasing a hulk-style clone of one of your friends around town trying to stop his destructive rampage.  And that's just what I've seen so far.  Did I mention that I'm only 35% through the main story?

Graphics:  I'm not a graphics snob, but SR does look good.  Not great, but there's plenty to look at and enjoy.  It runs in DirectX11 fairly smooth on my pc, with only the occasional stutter or slow down.  No big deal to me.  The game will also run in DirectX9 but I've never launched it in that mode to see what it looks like.  My only complaint is that on certain customization screens (cars particularly but clothing also), the lighting is a little dark which makes it hard to see color differences.

Sounds:  Guns go boom.  Explosions go BOOM.  The real standout here is the music.  Every vehicle that you drive has a radio so you'll spend a lot of time just cruising around, listening to it.  There's a nice assortment of stations to please almost any musical taste (no country music).  The only complaint is that after a while you get tired of hearing the same songs over and over again.  It would have been nice if the developers would have included a way to upload your own music into a custom station, Sims 3 style.

Controls:  I've read that one of the biggest complaints about Saints Row 2 (on the pc at least) was terrible controls.  Well there are no problems here.  It plays fine with my xbox controller and equally fine with my mouse and keyboard.  In a few particularly hard shooting missions I even used both a controller (to move around) and a mouse (to aim and shoot) at the same time.

Overall, I love this game.  I wouldn't list it as the greatest game ever made, but it is fun and it doesn't take itself very seriously.  We play games to have fun and this game is all about letting you have fun.  It's funny.  It's chock full of extreme violence.  Saints Row is that guy at the party who is a drunken ass, but he knows that he's a drunken ass and so do you and you invited him anyway, so there's no need to get pissed at him.  Just watch him and see what he does next.  I for one can't wait to see what SR does next.",GTA on Drugs,1364860800,,{'Platform:': ' PC Download'},

Before I start, I want to get a few things straight. Unfortunatly, Sega made the Dreamcast its last system. The Sega Saturn turned most people away from the Dreamcast, mainly because the Saturn (...). Production of Dreamcasts has stopped. This is why I own two. Sega moved from a First-Party developer to a Third-Party. They have started producing games for other systems, starting with Sonic Adventure 2 on the GameCube and Sonic Advance for the Game Boy Advance. Why they're hugging onto Nintendo, I don't know, but I thank them for not going to Sony or Microsoft. With that said, let's start talking about the game.
First off, if Sonic Adventure is too fast or hard for you, just go sell your Dreamcast; you can't handle it. The game wasn't made to be fast or hard. It was made as an introduction to the Dreamcast's awesome power, and to carry the Sonic legend on. In my opinion, Sonic is easy. There is no point in buying a guide. It is just the right speed and I wish it was faster. But this is just my opinion.
In a graphical standpoint, Sonic Adventure is amazing. The crisp visuals and not-so-often slowdown turned most people on. Rock on, Sega. 5 out of 5 for graphics.
The sound. Whoo boy, there's the problem. It has an awesome soundtrack. But the voice acting? Did they hire a 5-year-old for Tails? Big sounds like a (...). Good voice choices elesewhere, but the acting (...). 3 out of 5, Sega. Redeem yourselves.
Replay value? It skyrockets. There are five characters to play as, all with their own stories and objectives. The game doesn't end after each character has been completed. Instead, one more character is introduced, one that has been in every Sonic game to date. Can you guess his name? The first word rhymes with ""cooper."" 5 out of 5 for replay.
The overall score? If you don't know that, you must be flipping. How many stars did I give it, genius? Read the review, for the love of Pete.
Those who just pass up the Dreamcast because of Sega's past image are missing out on a treat. Happy Halloween, gamers. Go buy this system while there are still ones on the shelf. Pick up Sonic and Soul Calibur while you're at it. Good gaming.",My Second Review; Afterthoughts,1008892800,,,

Looking at gameplay videos on YouTube, I knew I was missing out on a good game. But it wasn't a good game, it was a work of art. If this was the only game I could purchase on the PS4, I'd be satisfied. The Last of Us is that good. The story, the characters, the voice acting, the character development all done beautifully by the fine folks at Naughty Dog. Every thing in the game from the dialogue to the crumbled buildings feel authentic.

You play as Joel, a man who has been surviving in the post apocalyptic world since it began. He is soon hired to escort a girl, Ellie, across the US as she posses the possible cure to save humanity. Along the way, the two will have to fight through all the zombies and corrupt survivors they come across. I know that's a bland summary, but this is a story I don't want to ruin. It's something you need to experience yourself. It's epic and gut wrenching a lot of the time.

You carry a backpack that holds all your weapons and collectibles and where you craft first aid kits and other weapons. The catch is that it's done in real time, so you need to make sure the coast is clear before going in your bag. The controls feel real smooth and shooting feels great. One nice twist is that if it's possible, you can sneak through an entire area if it's too overwhelming to get through by force. The graphics....They are gorgeous. I have never seen such an incredible and detailed game like this.

What Naughty Dog has created is a masterpiece. Beautiful story, characters, and graphics. No game has made me care about its characters and made me hope they succeed more than I do in The Last of Us. The gameplay is fun from start to end. There's a reason this game has won more than 200 awards. If you're like me and owned an Xbox 360 and switched over to the PS4, pick up this game. This is truly  a one of a kind game and and a work of art. This is the best game I've ever played.

Far Cry 2 throws the player in a fictional African country to hunt an illegal arms dealer known only as ""The Jackal"". The player (who can choose from 12 different characters in the beginning, the remaining 11 becomes the player's ""buddies"" throughout the game) will ally him/herself with various factions to accomplish this task, while dealing with a heavy case of malaria (which is not as annoying as it sounds). However, there is a huge plot twist towards the end of the game, but I won't spoil it with you (<cough>...ally...<cough>...with...<cough>...main target).

Here's a brief breakdown of the pros and cons of the game:

Pros:
1. BEAUTIFUL graphics and environments (no dark corridors in sight).
2. Realistic sound effects (the gunfire sounds, however, are not as good as Rainbow Six 3, but that's no big deal because RS3 represents the pinnacle of gunfire sounds in games).
3. Authentic African music that is very appropriate for a game set in Africa.
4. Various little things that enhance immersion: Guns rusting and jamming, pulling bullets out of your body, 24-hour cycle (1 minute real time = 5 minutes in game, strangely), changing weather, wildlife (no lions or alligators, thankfully), and many others.
5. NO TRIGENS!

Cons:
1. Getting from place to place can be a bit of a pain sometimes.
2. Some quirky AI.
3. Pop-up objects and textures from a distance (but considering how impressive the rest of the graphics are, this can easily be forgiven).
4. Slight repetitiveness (but all games get repetitive over time).
5. The ending is a little bit disappointing.

Simply put, Far Cry 2 is an amazing game. Don't worry about the Securom thing that everyone is whining about, I had no problem with it (nor did I have problems with Securom in Crysis: Warhead or Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway, or any game with copy protection systems).

I really hope that this game will be able to sell more than Call of Duty 4 (which I think is the most overrated game in history, I give it 6.0/10), FC2 is such a unique shooter with enough ""ooh"" and ""aah"" moments to justify its price (you can buy this game here for less than $[...], what a bargain!). I bought this game here on Amazon for about $[...] (this includes S&H) and I would've been more than happy to dish out the full $[...].

Let me put things in perspective. I've played over 200 games throughout my lifetime (if you e-mail me at tidalwave7451@yahoo.com, I can give you a complete list of all the games I've played through with a score out of 10), and let me tell you, this is the best game I've ever played. Sure, it's got some quirks, but all games have their share of good things and bad things, and the game's shortcomings never hamper gameplay or overall enjoyment.

For those of you that like this game, good for you.

For those of you that hate this game, sucks to be you.

For those of you who can't seem to get this game to work, get a new PC.

For those of you that are afraid of this game, don't worry. This game has nowhere near as many bugs as S.T.A.L.K.E.R. or Boiling Point has.

For those of you who are looking for a refreshing twist on the FPS genre, I got three words for you: BUY THIS GAME!

5.0,False,"11 4, 2007",A7Z6VFJVVVXBP,B000T4PCSW,Rich T.,"If you own a DS and enjoyed the movie Cars, don't hesitate to buy this game. Unlike the minigame collection that formed the DS version of the first Cars game, DS Maternational is everything you'd want from a DS Cars game: Fast, fun racing with all the humor and personality of the film.  It lacks the virtual-Radiator Springs world to drive around that forms the hub of the console versions, but the racing is smooth and well-done.

This is, hands-down, the 2nd most enjoyable racer on the DS (after Mario Kart.)

The game delivers a fully animated opening cinema (later cinemas from the console versions are presented as slide shows), a solid 3D racing game engine, voice acting for all characters during races (they're a very talkative bunch!) and imaginative tracks with hidden shortcuts that trigger in-race special events.

You begin with a choice of 2 racers (Lightning and Mater), unlocking more characters as you discover secret routes. Unlockable cars include Sheriff, Doc, Sarge, Flo, Lizzie and several others.

As a fan of old Sierra games (even though I was too young to have played the early LSL games), I was incredibly pleased to see the series resurrected and brought to new heights!

Important note: ""Magna Cum Laude: Uncut & Uncensored"" has now been released for the PC, and it features full frontal nudity and none of the pesky ""censorship bars"" that are present in this version.

Obviously, nudity is the main selling point of this game. Anyone who says otherwise is trying too hard to justify his or her purchase. The college co-eds are voluptuous, they are animated in a sexy, often provocative, ways, and the main quest of the game is to get Larry laid. Because of the time and attention put into creating realistic (though cute in an almost-anime way), this game is more titilating than any of the ""Dead or Alive"" series of fighting games, more fun than any of the WWE wrestling video games that feature the strip matches, and the females are more desirable than Lara Croft ever has been.

The women are mostly stereotypical ""college girls"" -- we have the head cheerleader Barbara Jo Bimbo (B.J. for short), the Italian castoff from ""The Sopranos"" Analisa, the Russian exchange student Zanna, the hot but nerdy college professor Beatrice, and so on. Chasing after each woman requires different approaches, and the result is never the same twice. And no, Larry *does not* get with all these babes. I hate to spoil it for you, but he only has actual intercourse a few times during the entire game. But every encounter is sexy, funny, and most importantly, packed full of eye candy!

The gameplay is fun. It is not very involving and has been criticized for being mostly a string of ""mini-games."" That is true; however, the variety of the games keeps it interesting as you progress through the storyline. The script is absolutely hilarious, and the comedy is equal to the nudity as a selling point for this game. If you are a guy, or even a gal who likes to laugh at guys, you will laugh at Larry and the things coming out of his mouth. He rambles on a lot, gets off-topic, tries horrible pickup lines, lies constantly, and even staggers around drunk and farts. If you've ever known a man who made you laugh simply because he was, to quote Steve Martin, ""a wild and crazy guy,"" then you will enjoy the story of Magna Cum Laude. And the voice acting is wonderful; there is not a bad actor or actress in this entire game.

Now a few words on the Mature Audiences rating: This game is about sex, breasts, drinking, jokes, and other things guys find enjoyable. For some people, this is disturbing. Those people need to get a life. I can play Grand Theft Auto, in which my character is able to walk down any street and at any moment cut off the head of a pedestrian with a sword. Or gun down dozens of policemen, only to enter a cheat code and get away with it all at the last possible minute. Yet somehow, the ESRB (game ratings board) finds Larry's girlfriends more offensive when they drop their shorts. Give us a break! Violence is much more detrimental to society & to teenagers than sex is, and yet we still can't get over our fear of pixelated private parts. It's ridiculous!

All in all, I give ""LSL: Magna Cum Laude"" a totally positive recommendation to anyone old enough to purchase it. It was definitely one of the best games of 2004 simply because it is like nothing else on the market today: a fun, sexy romp through college life. 5 stars! 2 thumbs up!

There is nothing like playing not only Jack Bauer, but others from the series. At one point, you even play Kim Bauer. This game is full of action and puzzles, but it being written by those who do the TV series makes it even more incredible.

Things that were left blank between seasons two and three, such as how Jack met Chase, are explained in the game. That is why this game would mainly only appeal to fans, like the series, there is a lot of dialogue and it may turn non-fans off if they don't like a lot of talk in their action games. But, what the characters in the story are saying is very interesting and you will be hanging on to every word if you are a fan of the series. A lot of people who were still alive by the end of season two are on this game, which just makes it all the better.

The game also has it's share of puzzles that are not extremely difficult but can take some time to complete. You also have to interrogate people on some levels to get information which is probably the most tedious and frustrating part. To question people on some levels, you have to stop the marker in a blue bar, but the blue bar sometimes moves.

There are also special features that include interviews with the people who voice the game, but all extras besides the season 4 trailer have to be unlocked. Overall, if you really enjoy the show and it's characters, then I would recommend this game to you. It is fun and I definitely think I'll be playing this game again. If you are not a fan of the TV show or have never seen it, then I would recommend renting to get a feel of the game.

5.0,False,"03 24, 2005",A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F,B0002A6CPA,Mike,"The story is basically between gladiator fights and stealth missions. The stealth missions are bad. At the end of the game you just control Agrippa over and over again because even the creators couldn't find an interesting way to end the game with Octavionus. The gladiator fights are the highlights of the game.

You control Agrippa, and you must complete different objectives, in order to obtain victory. There are team battles, rescues, sieges, animal fights, dominations, chariot races, and one called sword struggle which is real fun.

You can get tons of weapons to cut off foes arms and head. Halberds, mauls, schimiters, gladius', maces, torches, bows, daggers, rocks, spears, slings, and an awesome two-handed sword. There are several variations on these weapons, such as power gladius' and apollo's spear. The fun thing about the game is killing your opponents in different ways. The game rewards you with different salvo moves. You can cut people in half and watch blood shoot everywhere. You can grab a chick from behind, cover her mouth, and stab her in her stomach. You can suplex someone off a really high castle. There are so many creative ways to keep yourself entertained that you will want to fight gladiator battles over and over again.

Once you play these missions once on normal, or hard, you can play them again whenever you like in battle selection. You can unlock new salvo moves and get more salvo points. Although these salvo points don't count to your total salvo points in the actual game, you can get better trophies. Unlocking all bronze trophies in normal gives you a stupid art gallery, but I plan on unlocking more stuff later.

The stealth missions of this game are stupid. Some people like them, but I can't do stealth missions like this after playing games like Splinter Cell and Metal Gear Solid. You do the same stuff over and over again.

First, you get a disguise. Then, you are forced to walk around for 15 minutes in that disguise. If you run for .8 seconds, a guard will run up and kill you in one hit. You are not allowed to run at all. Any running whatsoever results in the guards killing you. Occasionaly guards will stop to talk to you if you have a disguise on. They may say a few different things, but I have learned that only once choice out of the three is correct. Actually, I once encountered a guard who would kill you no matter how you responded. I constantly had to reload and I finally realized that I should just run past this guard into the next room, where the guards won't follow me. That's another thing. If you hide from a guard for 3 seconds, they give up and stop looking for you. If you were a guard and saw someone sneaking around, would you look for 3 seconds and then give up on him? The AI is stupid like that.

You can buy stuff with the coins you find. This stuff doesn't really do anything. It makes your room look cool, but that doesn't save the Octavionus missions.

Imagine walking around for 15 minutes, while hitting guards on the back of their heads with urns. Now imagine running around in an arena filled with blood, while a crowd cheers you for breaking the arms of a man then slicing his head off while he begs for his life. The gladiator fights are awesome and fast-paced, the stealth missions are stupid and slow. The gladiator fights are perfect, and If you can put up with some stupid crap you won't be dissapointed.","Good gladiator fights, crappy filler stealth missions",1111622400,10,,

2. The prequel story is already coming together - I can tell where they are going to be heading with Tron: Legacy in 2 weeks, and it's good!
3. The graphics are awesome.
4. The gameplay is a 3rd person, Prince of Persia / Ninja Gaiden / Matrix sort of hybrid, like nothing I've ever seen.
5. The multiplayer was great! I've scored first place in two matches already! The ability to jump right into and out of matches during campaign is good.
6. Includes the original Tron as an in-game character, along with Kevin Flynn. I don't know if it is their real voices or not, but it sounds just like them.
7. The music by Sascha Dikiciyan (and SOME Daft Punk) is outstanding. It is electronica at its coolest.

The Amazon version I received contained a card in the box with a code that let you download a Sam Flynn skin and 2 multiplayer maps. I don't know if this is included in all versions, or pre-orders only. There are no multiplayer maps on Xbox Live DLC as of now (12-7-10).

I'll probably add more to this review later. All I can say is, if you like Tron at all, BUY THIS GAME NOW!!!

5.0,False,"02 11, 2014",A27OW0P38B28OP,B00GV4V8YQ,Relytia,"By now, many people have reported how their Bravely Default CE was shipped to them poorly and ended up arriving damaged if you ordered directly from Amazon. If you ordered yours' from Amazon, you have my sympathies, as I can imagine the pain you'd be in seeing such a lovely package delivered in such a unfortunate way. Thankfully, I pre-ordered mine from Best Buy, who packaged mine very well. That been said, I thought I'd try my hand at actually reviewing this package as a Collector's Edition specifically, as many reviews on the page here are about the game only, OR they're just about the Amazon shipping debacle. So, how does this rate as a CE specifically?

- The Game. Obviously, this is the biggest draw of the overall package. I already posted a detailed review of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bravely-Default-as-a-game-on-the-standard-edition-s-page/dp/B00GV4V8XC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bravely Default as a game on the standard edition's page</a>&nbsp;and I don't want to go into such detail here. For this particular review, I'll just sum the game up thusly: Bravely Default is an exceptionally designed, impressively refined JRPG that evokes tons of nostalgia for Squaresoft's era of PS1 JRPG masterpieces. Think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chrono-Cross/dp/B00004TC6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chrono Cross</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Xenogears/dp/B000038IFX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Xenogears</a>, and especially&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Final-Fantasy-IX/dp/B00004Y57G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Final Fantasy IX</a>, and you've got a good idea of what to expect. The game adds its own interesting twists to the traditional JRPG formula, which makes BD feel like a fresh, modern take on a classic genre. The hand drawn graphics are jaw-droppingly gorgeous, with a style that combines watercolor paintings and old-timey children's fairy tails. The visuals light up your imagination and immediately suck you into the game's world. The soundtrack is nothing short of brilliant (more on that later). The story itself is not necessarily the most innovative for the genre, but it is told exceptionally well. It moves at a mostly fantastic pace and is full of charming, likable characters that are developed really well. Bravely Default may have some nit-picky aspects here and there, but for the most part, it's a masterfully executed game, and any fan of the classic JRPGs of yore who has a 3DS owes it to themselves to pick this game up. It has the kind of intangible magic and refinement that the Final Fantasy series has&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/been-sadly-lacking-for-several-years/dp/B000FQ2DTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">been sadly lacking for several years</a>. BD is a wonderful game, plain and simple. So that's the game, a solid 8.5-9/10, and as the main attraction to buying this CE, it's a big incentive. So how's the rest of the CE, you may wonder?

- The box. The package the CE comes in is very well designed. It's the size of a large book and opens up like one. On the cover is a classy silverish image of one of the game's main characters, and the back features lush screenshots of the game and its art. Lovely. Once opened, there are several compartments where the rest of the CE's treasures comfortably sit. It's a fantastic presentation. I totally understand why so many were upset when they found theirs mangled by poor packaging, as the box is gorgeous when intact.

- The AR cards. One of the more unique and unusual features of Bravely Default is its use of AR cards. Not many games have used this feature at all really, let alone well, but BD has integrated it in unique ways. To that end, this CE has a tiny box no bigger than a standard card deck would come in, filled with 34 AR cards. Each card features a lovely portrait of one of the many characters from the game, whether primary and secondary. The art on these cards is very nice, and the printing is fairly  high quality. Even if you never used these as AR cards, they are still pretty nice as collector quality items in my opinion.

- The soundtrack. As I said earlier, the soundtrack in BD is incredible. If you told me that the music in this game was some long-lost collaboration between&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yasunori-Mitsuda/dp/B000006XL9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yasunori Mitsuda</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nobuo-Uematsu/dp/B00025E1TO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nobuo Uematsu</a>, I'd believe you. Seriously, the music in BD has the beautiful melodies characteristic of Mitsuda's music, and the elegant sophistication of Uematsu's work. I also hear&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Joe-Hisaishi/dp/B00006HCT7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Joe Hisaishi</a>&nbsp;in it as well. There's even a bit of kick-@$$ rock thrown in the mix at times. Seriously, what an amazing soundtrack. To get a CD featuring ten songs from it, lasting 35:42 in total, is quite the treat. Really, my only complaint about this part of the package is that it's only a fraction of the great music that went into the game, but that just serves to compliment the soundtrack itself more than anything; it really is that good. Revo, the composer for the game, did a superb job. In my opinion, the mini album is worth the extra ten bucks for the CE by itself.

- The art book. What a treat this is. I really can't emphasize how beautiful of a game BD is, and that really is all thanks to the gorgeous art design behind it. The hand drawn style really lends itself wonderfully to the game, and that becomes apparent thumbing through the art book included in the CE. It is roughly as long as the CE's box is tall, and a little shorter than the width of the box, if that makes sense. It's a decent sized book, coming in at a little over 60 pages of jaw-dropping, splendid art. There's a really good variety too, with concept AND promotional art for many characters, locales, and scenarios. Almost all of the character design was done by Akihiko Yoshida, famous for his work on games like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Final-Fantasy-Tactics/dp/B000SSPH3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vagrant-Story/dp/B00004SPW9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vagrant Story</a>, many of the recent FF DS remakes, etc. There's also lots of space featuring the spectacular locales from the game. It's great. The printing quality is really done too, for the most part. Sadly, there's one page in my copy that is marred by a very small printing defect. Other than that, the art book is excellent. Much like the music CD, I think it'd be worth getting the CE for the art book alone.

- The price. Ordinarily, I don't stop to talk about pricing, but I feel compelled to with this one. This CE is $50. The standard edition of the game is $40. That's a mere ten dollars for a neat pack of 32 AR cards that can be enjoyed as collector's items OR as AR cards used in the game, a musical CD featuring over 35 minutes of incredibly awesome music, and a gorgeous little book featuring tons of art from one of the 3DS' most visually beautiful games. Again... Only. Ten. Dollars. More. Wow. I would've been happy to spend 60-70 for this CE, but to get it for a mere $50 almost feels like I'm getting away with robbery. I personally think it's a great value. If you can still find one for that price, buy it immediately.

So there you have it. Pretty much everything about this CE package screams 5-stars to me. I know a lot of people complain that we didn't get the statue of Agnes like other regions did, but when you consider the price tag and the amazing things we do get, I still think this is a top-quality package. They just don't make games like these that often anymore, sadly. They don't go all-out for collector's editions like this anymore either. Bravely Default is such a lovely game on its own, worthy of pretty much every 3DS owner's attention. If you are a fan of the legendary Squaresoft of yore like I am and yearn to experience some of that good ol' magic, then I heartily recommend this CE. Just make sure you're careful that whoever you order it from packages it with the care such a great CE deserves. Hope you found this review helpful. Thanks for reading.

General Tips

  In character creation we can't choose our height but we can modify our body type.
  The difference between the six difficulty modes, apart from the obvious damage dealt/received multiplier, is that the higher the difficulty the greater the chance to find Legendary Enemies that drop better loot.
  You start with 21 points that you can distribute into various stats, and 7 points that are already distributed, because each SPECIAL starts at 1. This will determine you character through the entirety of the game. You'll actually have 28 distributed when you're done assigning them. (thanks Rekalty)
  You get +1 Perception bobblehead and a ""You Are SPECIAL book"" (+1 to anything you want) early on, so plan as if you had 30 points at start. (thanks DaneelR)
  Perks at INT 1 and PER 3 are mandatory - they will make the game much easier.
  Collect bobbleheads and perk magazines [...]
  Finding and collecting Perk magazines [...] unlocks and upgrades unique perks that are otherwise inaccessible.
  Bobbleheads are hidden throughout the Commonwealth. They increase a S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stat or upgrade a perk
  Some Magazines add new construction items to settlements
  When you discover a location's name by visiting it, you can fast travel to it afterwards.
  Use quicksave all the time, but also save manually (through the menu) twice an hour.
  You can't go back in the dialogue to choose another option
  When an item has a ""+"" next to its name, it means that item is better in some way than what you're currently using.
  Stealth mode is similar to Skyrim but more improved. Lots of perks related to stealth and theft.
  If you're missing some crafting items, you can tag them for search, which will highlight them in the world when you explore.
  Sleeping in beds regenerates your health. Sleeping in nice beds gives you the Well Rested perk for a limited time, which increases your XP gain by 10%.
  Use Cooking Station to prepare food that will heal you, increase your AP, damage, resistances, etc for a while. The ingredients are free and most of them are pretty common (like Molerat meat).
  Grab all the plates you can find - you're going to need the ceramic for crafting.
  You can earn a lot of experience by crafting - keep this in mind even if you don't like that part of the game.
  Holotape Games are mini-games you can play on your Pip-Boy in Fallout 4. There are five of them, and all except the first one have to be unlocked.
  Some dialogue options are colored to indicate the chance of success depending on your charisma level (red, orange, green).
  Loading time depends on the type of activity. For example: big buildings require some short loading time (black screen), fast travel requires longer loading time
  Some ideas for starting builds / stats [...]

  Bobbleheads boost your special stat to 11 ONLY if you area already at 10 when you pick them up, otherwise they simply boost it one stat point and you are UNABLE to manually raise it to 11 later. [...] (thanks Dustin1280 and Metal_LinksV2)

Power Armor

  Power Armor needs a fusion core to run.
  There's a perk related to its duration.
  You can sprint and jump while in Power Armor.
  When in power armor carry weight threshold and rad resistance are higher but you'll move much slower.
  You can enter buildings while in Power Armor without problems.
  Even though its robust, you can sneak and fast travel while in your Power Armor.
  Equipping it will increase your Strength to 11.
  Power Armor has the best radiation resistance, and can be modded with jetpacks and other useful mods.
  You can get modes by completing quests or defeating enemies with proper equipment.
  Traders that sell Power Armor parts usually have some fusion cores in stock as well
  Always thoroughly search around Power Armor stations, and in camps where you fight enemies using these suits, you'll find fusion cores there.
  Power Armor can be damaged, and needs frequent repairs.
  While wearing Power Armor you lose any bonuses from other armor items.
  Power Armor can be stolen!
  Approach the stand and exit the armor to store your power armor on the stand

  If you want to take off Power Armor hold the button you used to enter it.

Fights

  Cover system is contextual. You don't have to press any button, just walk towards the object you want to cover behind.
  Enemies are really adaptive and extremely smart in harder modes. Damage resistance of enemies, and appearance of legendary enemies are different on harder modes.
  Giant enemies (like deathclaws) can't go through regular doors.
  When an enemy doesn't see you, the fight will be interrupted after a few moments, even if he's close to you.
  Let friendly NPCs and companions fight your fights whenever possible - it conserves ammo.
  Your accuracy increases when you crouch.
  Use VATS whenever you start a fight, then fight in real time while your Action Points regenerate.
  Hold the reload button to holster your weapon (square on PS4).

  Hold the pip-boy button to turn on your flashlight (circle on PS4).

Weapons

  There will be about 50 weapons in the game, along with over 700 mods.
  In order to customize your weapon you need to have the appropriate perk  Gun Nut for regular weapons,Science for energy ones.
  Each weapon will consist of several parts, any one of which can be swapped at the workbench.
  New type of weapon damage is radiation.
  You can optimize your guns for speed, accuracy and handling
  Unique weapons have their own names, and beside the regular stats, they provide one-of-a-kind bonuses.
  Legendary enemies have a chance of dropping legendary item or weapon with unique characteristics like better critical chance, or something that refills your action points much faster compared to other weapons.
  Weapon stats can vary based on your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. ranks, active perks, and any mods that are currently applied.

  Commando perk affects all automatic pistols and rifles except heavy guns.

Settlements

  You'll get a message or notification when your settlements are under attack. You have options to go and help your people or leave them.
  Settlementsare completely optional, but if you decide to get into it, Settlements are going to be a full-time job

  Workbenches (used for crafting weapons and gear) can be found throughout the world, but some may not be usable because someone else may have ownership over it, so you'll have to undertake a certain quest to really please them and gain access to their workbench.

Companions
* You can choose between 13 companions * You may only have one companion with you at any given time.
* When you dismiss a companion, theyll either go to your settlement, or the place where you found them.
* Companions cannot die  when hurt badly enough, theyll get knocked out until the end of combat.
* There are commands you can issue to companions, like sending them to pick up items, use objects or go to certain places.
* Some companions are romanceable, regardless of your characters gender.
* In order to begin a romance, youll have to raise your Relationship Level with companion.
* When you reach maximum Relationship level with a companion, youll unlock the Loveable achievement.
* You'll be able to romance 7 companions: some humans, a ghoul and a robot [...]
* Various actions you do in the games world affect your relationship status with companions differently. For example: lockpicking is something Strong will dislike, while protecting and being nice to ghouls is something that will increase relationship status with Hancock.
* Actions you do in a settlement that has multiple companions stored in it can affect all companions at once. For example: giving Mama Murphy drugs for telling you your future will be disliked by all companions in the settlement you're in.
* Each companion has a unique perk [...] which remains active as long as the companion is following you.
* Companions perk is active regardless of the distance between you and companion.
* Dogmeat can be equipped with armor and handkerchiefs
* You don't get XP when a companion kills enemy solo (you have to do some damage to the enemy to be granted XP reward for its kill).",general tips,1447113600,64,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I long for games like this that have the graphics and gameplay to take advantage of the hardware Sony has brought to market.  I would have preferred a more 3D environment in the game, but they do a very good job of exploiting this 2.5D format.

My only complaint ... and it's not small, but it is only one ... is that with all this powerful hardware, we still can't get full versions.  I'd like to see the full Arkham Origins on Vita, not a pared down spinoff.  The game is great, but I'm tired of feeling like the leftover pot roast whenever new games come out for every system but mine.  Sony has a monster console on its hands with the Vita, and they do very little to recognize that.

If you want to use your Vita as it was intended, get this game ... it's great.

And the more players buy games like this the more good games they will bring to market.  I showed this game (on Vita) to my brother in law, who was playing it on his 3DS ... and he was blown away.  The graphics and controls made for a totally different experience.  That's not a swipe at the 3DS, because it is a great console too ... but Vita has a lot to be proud of, except for its game catalog.

The story is pretty good, but for me it wasn't the story that kept me going.  It was the sheer awesomeness of the combat.  It was just so fun and so varied.  Stealth kills, run-and-gun kills, and more.  For me the best part was capturing the enemy bases (which unlocks fast-travel points).  Each new base was a new challenge that I'd spend a few minutes on observing, trying to develop the proper tactics and strategy.  I don't know that any other game has made me want to do that.  Something about this game is just so addicting.

The only negative that I can come up with is that some of the Path of the Hunter side quests were a little frustrating (hide and seek with an animal essentially).  And vehicle control left something to be desired.  But these are very minor things that do not detract from my overall enjoyment.

Final word: Buy this game.  Truly amazing.",This should be the model for future games,1367193600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Not without its fair share of controvesy and complaints from shocked parents, this Mature rated game is just that mature. Children really shouldn't play this at all. Cursing is not as apparent as the scare tactics would have you believe, and when you do shoot someone it is pretty gory, but you usually don't have to. Some of the missions revovle around ""working girls"" and this can be a cause of concern. If you are mature enough to handle all this you should defineatly buy Grand Theft Auto.
 It has more to offer then any other game I have ever played. You can play the missions for the mob bosses in pretty well any order you want, or you can steal an ambulance to do the ambulance missions, a firetruck to do the firetruck missions, and a poilce car or a tank to do vigilante missions. If this doesn't tickle your fancy, you can just go around the huge 3-D enviornment of Liberty City and go on your own crime wave. Liberty City is huge and you steal any car that's not tied down and drive till your blue in the face. Very simillar to the gaming experiance on Driver II. Or you go around on foot, like a prototype version of Max Payne. Driver II plus Max Payne equals a great replay value. This game is definatley worth your fifty bucks.
There are three huge areas, Portland, where you start out, Staunton Island, then Shoreside Vale. Each area adds some new cars. Cars aren't the only way to travel in Liberty City though, you can go by train, by subway, by boat, plane, and on foot, at different ocassions through this great game, that never gets old. There's really only three buildings you can go into to but the game doesn't lack for anything as a result. You can go into a gun shop called Ammu-Nation, spray shops, and 8-ball's bomb shop. There's seven gangs, a great cast of characters and great writting, with great graphics,sound, and value.

5.0,True,"12 26, 2011",A2N60VDBR10N18,B002BRUTT2,Tyler Johnson,"Let me quickly qualify why this is a big deal for me to call this my favorite RPG. The first RPG I ever played was Mario RPG: Legend of the seven stars, a game that is considered a masterpiece to this day. The game that solidified my love for the RPG genre was final fantasy 7, which remains one of my favorites to this day. I have played and beaten final fantasy 6,7,8,9,and 10. I hated 12 and 13. I've played and beaten kingdom hearts 1 and 2, chrono trigger, paper mario 1,2, and super. I have run through every fire emblem game I can find, and with all that being said, Nier is STILL my favorite RPG of all time.

Nier is the story of Nier and his daughter Yonah, who is afflicted with the incurable disease, the black scrawl. In his pursuit to find a cure, Nier comes across the ancient, and very funny talking book, Grimoire Weiss. Together they set off to find the sealed verses that hold the key to saving the life of Nier's daughter.

 The relationship between Nier and Yonah is different from most relationships in gaming. Nier is a hard working, loving father, who will do everything in his power to see his daughter healed. They live in an idealic village full of kind hearted people, who care for Yonah while Nier is away searching for a cure, and are not shy about asking for favors.

An important note is that to get the full experience, you NEED to play through this game at least twice. This game features a new game plus that drops you at the halfway point of the game the second time through, and unveils the second side of the story. This adds depth and context to the game that most of the professional reviewers missed. Nier has one of the most affecting and heart wrenching stories I've ever had the privilege of playing, and it demands to be experienced.

Throughout the game, you have the option to take sidequests for the people of your village, and later the residents of other towns,in exchange for money. Many critics have complained of the repetitive nature of many of the quests. I myself enjoyed them, and there are many quests that have humorous and sometimes tragic story lines attached to them.

The biggest gripe that nearly every professional reviewer had against this amazing game is that the graphics aren't very good. This is a non issue for me. I personally enjoy Niers graphics. They are clean, bright and uncomplicated. One of my favorite games of all time is final fantasy tactics; a truly hideous game, with a terrible story, but some of the most enjoyable gameplay of its kind. Nier trades flashy, pointless graphics for wide open spaces and lightning fast loading times; a trade I with more games would be willing to make.

The gameplay is solid. Nier is not turn based, but more hack and slash. Nier does what you tell him to do, when you tell him to do it; you really can't ask for much more. The physical attacks are pretty simple, but it is the magic attacks that are spectacular. From launching multiple magical spears to forming an enormous hand to crush your foes, the magic attacks are numerous and varied. Nier moves quickly, and even has double jump, making traveling and exploration hassle free. The Boss battles are fun and varied. They do a good job of mixing up the boss encounters. Very rarely will a boss fight devolve into hit and run tactics, which is a good thing.

The characters Nier and Weiss are terrific company, and you will never be bored. Their witty banter is dotted throughout the game, and they have a lot to say. I often found myself smiling and laughing along with them, which is rare. The strongest point in this game though has to be the music. Never before have I been so entranced by a games soundtrack that I put the controller down so I could listen to it without any ambient noise to get in the way. Some people have complained about the endless musical loops that inhabit each area, but when the music is this amazing, I doubt many people mind.

All in all, Nier is the complete package. The graphics are clean and effective. The gameplay is fun and efficient. The characters are fleshed out and engaging. The story is deep, complex, and moving. The music is breathtakingly beautiful. Most importantly the game is a joy to play; it gets my highest recommendation.

First, the background. You're an adventurer in the 1930s whose father is missing. You track him down on an island, where you hook up with a woman to take on a mad scientist.
The basis of both of your armies is creature morphing. In essence you go around finding new creatures and snagging their DNA. You then go into your lab and can combine the body parts of ANY TWO CREATURES, and create your own uber-creature with the best of both!
This means the game is pretty much infinitely playable and is amazingly fun in multiplayer. Do you like dolphins and zebras? Why not combine the sleek swimming of the dolphin with the kicking hooves of the zebra! You can combine tigers and wasps. Leopards and oxen. The combinations are pretty much endless and it is quite a thrill to see how each one works out.
The missions in the game each call for certain tactics, as you learn how to go over, under, and through obstacles. But really the best gameplay comes when you take on other humans, and see how your favorite combos fare against their favorites.
Even if you're not into the fighting part, the creature creation can be quite fun on its own. An enjoyable, imaginative strategy game for all ages.","Fun, imaginative strategy gameplay",1047686400,12,,

When the PC version of Medal of Honor (Electronic Arts) was released in late 2001, I and many other gamers immediately realized that game design had just taken both a technical, as well as an artistic, leap forward.  No doubt, Medal of Honor raised the bar substantially.

But, when EA and DICE released their much anticipated multiplayer demo of Battlefield 1942, it became immediately evident that PC game design had dramatically pushed the envelope of both artistic and technical achievement.  This game is so different, so awe inspiring, so technically advanced that I predict it will do more than just raise the bar - it will change gaming forever.  In fact, it is so different, that I hesitate to call it a game, I'd prefer to call it a battlefield simulation!

The incredible complexity of Battlefield 1942's game engine is what is most fascinating.  Think about the gameplay experience that is available in this Battlefield simulation:

All four major WWII theaters of operation!

More than 30 vehicles to ride, fly, or float around in, including surprisingly realistic look and feel of the original jeeps, tanks, and aircraft!

The Bad Guys (Axis) and Good Guys (Allies) in all their glory!

All of the classic WWII weapons!

Gameplay experiences that are both exciting,  realistic, and true to the original experience!

State of the art graphics engine!

There is no other way to say it - this game is destined for greatness!  Write it down in the history books - Battlefield 1942 is more than a noteworthy and significant event in the annals of gaming - it's a legend in the making!",A LEGEND IN THE MAKING!,1031011200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
5.0,False,"01 27, 2009",A2OD43W7EGDH97,B000ZKDOV2,John Berger,"I have avoided violent, sandbox games because I don't like the thought of shooting law enforcement (even in games ... yeah, whatever), and I just never understood the desire for people to play ""the bad guy"". Call it my own moral and ethical compass or something.  But I decided to throw caution into the wind and actually buy one of these games.  Considering how popular they are, they must be doing something right.

I was amazed at how much fun and expansive ""Saints Row 2"" is.

When I first started playing it, I walked/drove around for hours just marveling at the attention to detail in the buildings, landscape, and activity that went on around me.  Even sidewalks that you would have zero chance of seeing under normal circumstances, hidden behind derelict buildings, can have small details like gang symbols painted on them.  The attention to detail in Stilwater is just amazing!

I'm the kind of person who has to play a game to the utter completion when possible.  When playing fantasy RPG games like ""Neverwinter Nights"", I hate leaving side-quests unfinished.  I hate having incomplete maps.  If I'm playing a game, I want to experience the whole game.  ""Saints Row 2"" has such a huge amount of side material to play that I anticipate at least 80 hours of gameplay from running around, exploring, and performing side quests, before I consider it to be done to my satisfaction.  Getting 80 hours from any kind of game is utterly unheard of!  I've already played for over 24 hours, having done a large number of side quests and activities, and I'm only at 20% completion!

What really helped me to overcome the ""playing the bad guy"" issue is that Volition loaded the game with just utter silliness.  They clearly made the smart move in removing some of the realism to add humor and goofy playability.  Whether the humor comes from the outrageous commercials on the radio or the sheer toilet humor (pun intended) in spraying sewage all over the place, there is a ton of off-the-wall humor and irreverent activities in this game.  Even being able to just wave ""hello"" to passers by and have them respond adds another bit of over-the-top silliness.  Here you are trying to take over the city, having just ruthlessly killed rival gang members, but wave ""Hi"" to a person walking down the street and they respond like you're the friendliest person on each.  It's one of those stupid, subtle bits of humor that had me chuckling not because it was genuinely funny but because of its absurdity.

I share the frustration with other reviewers that cars, people, or objects have a tendency to disappear once they are out of your view.  There have been many times where a car that is wanted at the chop shop would pass me, and by the time I turn around to try to carjack it it's gone.  Other times I'm just so frustrated with running that I turn around to steal the car in the parking lot that I just ran past.  The car's not there any more.  This happens often and can be incredibly annoying.  This game should be fixed so that there is a certain radius around your character where all items or people stay where they are until they are completely out of that radius.

The only real WTF moment was when I saw that the ""streaking"" game utilized censorship over the character's nether-regions.  Once again, the American need to act Puritanical shows itself.  Blood, violence, swearing, running over people with the car, mowing them down with a machine gun, killing law enforcement -- hey, no problem!  But show a certain part of the body and suddenly it's ""NO, NO, NO!! We can't show that!  Blowing people's heads off is fantastic!  Go for it!  But don't expect us to show a nipple!  We have to censor that!""  { face palm }  Volition, either we're mature enough to handle the whole package or we're not!  Pick one!  Don't treat us like adults and use the ""M"" rating for cover when it comes to violence, then hide in cowardice and treat us like children who need to be shielded when it comes to nudity!

Regardless, I was shocked at how much fun this game is.  The violence  is cartoonish more than anything else; the gameplay can be fast and furious; hidden items and quests abound; there are lots of absurd humorous bits; and the number of side quests and activities can keep you occupied for dozens and dozen of hours.

Buy it.

Luckily, it doesn't seem like too much was changed. This is a very unique and different type of mech game. Forget the lumbering behemoths of MechAssault, these little sport mecha (called ""ScoBees"") are small, Volkswagen-size competition vehicles, meant to move fast, bounce around, and sneak about using ""Predator""-like Optic Camo. Matches are fast-paced and hectic, a free-for-all among mecha of different makes, models, and loadouts, all competing to move up the ranks of the sport (called ""Rumbling"") and make money to customize and improve, re-arm, and personalize their mechs. The options for tuning up your vehicle are numerous, and there is a considerably deep customization aspect to be discovered and experimented with. True, the game only includes 3 arenas. While it would certainly have been nice to have more, they all present high-risk bottlenecks, dangerous stretches, and even a huge labyrinth of an underground parking garage. Put all of this to the truly different and eclectic soundtrack that consists of all Japanese bands and artists, and you have a very original and intense game.

This one is similar to the classic controller, which doesn't work with new new Donkey Kong Country, but is wireless rather than needing to be plugged in to a wiimote.

A few people have mentioned counterfeit products going around, so I was careful to ensure that I was ordering with Amazon as the seller. I received the remote last week and have probably spent around 8 hours playing Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze with it.

The controls are placed similarly enough to the gamepad that it was easy to pick this up and jump right in (actually I've not used the gamepad since getting this one). I've died many times, but that's due to my lack of skill; I haven't had any occasions when I've felt that the controller wasn't responding correctly. (A few times I've apparently hit the L/R buttons by accident, but I did that with the gamepad as well). The controller fits well in my hands; actually it's probably the most comfortable controller I own. I charged it when I got it and haven't bothered plugging it in again since then; I'll update this review after I've used it a while but from the other reviews I expect to be able to finish the game on one charge. The rumble seems fine. This controller obviously won't work for games that take advantage of the various sensors in the wiimotes, but for non-motion-sensitive games I believe it's going to work just fine.",Donkey Kong and the Pro Controller,1395100800,3,,

The console fits nicely in the velcro straps and does not move at all when both are taught. The pull out pouch was designed for the Kinect, but I use it to hold the power adapter and rechargeable AA batteries instead.

The fabric made to hold game discs feels rough to the touch. I did not want to risk my game discs sliding on that material. I stick to my 50 disc leather disc folio instead. The pouch for the Kinect/power adapter fits in this area anyways.

The large pouches are designed to hold controllers, but I don't use them and can fit 3 Xbox controllers on the top part of the case without any issues.

The large pouch on the outside front of the bag holds my AA battery charger and the Amazon Basics HDMI cable. This pouch can hold more, but this is all I store in there.

The bag comes with a shoulder strap that I never use. I left it detached and carry it by hand. This also eliminates the risk of ripping the bag from it getting caught on something.

You end up tweaking everything you can on your machine with little satisfactory results so you end up waiting for the proverbial ""PATCH.""  Makes you want to scream don't it?
Not so with Microsoft/Ensemble Studios - these guys get it right, right out of the box and with Age of Mythology they not only shipped a stable game they have, in my opinion, produced the top RTS of all time.  There is simply to much gaming goodness to go into all of it here, but some of the highlights that jumped out at me...
The game looks terrific.  The user interface is smooth  & beautiful.  Makes you feel like you are driving a hand made Italian sports car.  The  music is a perfect fit for mythological times and some of it can only be defined as well.., ""lovely.""  In fact my wife stuck her head in the game room and said, ""that is haunting music, what is it""? At first she didn't believe it could have anything to do with a computer game.
You can play three civilizations Greek, Egyptian & Norse.  And the different nuances are considerable.  One civ is not just a rehash of the another with a bit of a different look. If you try to use the same tactics that were successful with the Greeks while playing the Norse you will go down to defeat. You have the option of playing a 36 mission single player campaign covering the Greek, Norse & Egyptian civs which is top notch but I suspect most hardcore RTS players will jump right to random map or multiplayer which may not be the best idea.  Single player will give you insights that may be very handy before random map or going on-line.
The developers were very very smart with this game.  If you are an Age of Empires fan you can dig right in and start playing Age of Mythology as both games have the basic RTS theme of rescource gathering, building, up-grading, attack and defense. But there is so much more in AOM - Do I want the standard infantary and ranged attack army or how about a mob of mythical creaturs to do my bidding?  What major god do I choose to honor? What minor god? Do I want a magical underground tunnel that will take me immidiately to the enemy's gates or do I want that mind-blowing meteor shower instead.  There are 9 major and 27 minor gods to choose from with differnt creatures and powers to be had.  The permutations and combinations seem endless.
AOM will win RTS game of the year hands down and will likey be game of the year overall winner to boot.

I purchased the original version of this game on the Gamecube when it was first released and recently bought this one for the extras not included on the Gamecube version (namely, Separate Ways).  The gameplay adapts itself to the wiimote quite nicely, though there is a short adjustment curve while getting used to the controls (this lasts for maybe a half an hour).  Past that, this game is fun, fun, fun!  The controls are great, the story is solid, and it's not too easy or too difficult.  Plus there are lots of extras, meaning that there's a ton of replay.  I can't count the number of hours I've put into this game.

There are only three things I can critique about this game.  One, the dialogue gets really cheesy at times.  Two, there are quicktime events, and some of them pop out of nowhere, leading to a whole lot of ""HOLY CRAP I JUST DIED.""  Third, Ashley is a pain in the butt.  However, these do not detract from the game enough for me to lower the rating.

I can't believe that [...] gave this game a 3.5 out of 10 and really hated it.

For the first several hours I was constantly marveling at how enjoyable the motion control made this game compared to a traditional game of this type.

Pros:
-- innovative use of motion controls brings a fresh perspective to a well-worn game style.  The game feels much more immersive when you actually swing either hand (remote & nunchuck) one of three different directions to punch in various ways, throw your whip to grab someone & then flick it back towards you to pull them to you, etc.  When you must flee from danger you vigorously wave your hands like you're running - this gets your heart rate going & your really get excited about the game.  There are many small cool touches with the motion controls that delight:  moving your hands like you're wielding a flint to start a fire, waving your torch to clear spiders around you, holding the remote like an airplane flight stick to fly a plane, etc.

Simply put - this game has some of the best uses of the Wii control style I've seen and it actually uses it to immerse you in the experience rather than just ""tilting the remote to steer your car"" type of controls.  Many Wii games' motion control feels gimmicky & tacked on, but this game feels just right.

-- The game is not too hard (may be a con for more hard-core gamers) making it enjoyable to just play.  In a typical game like this I would get frustrated many times dying repeatedly, wondering where to go, what to do, etc and either finally put it down or start referring to online game guides to get through it.

A major contributor to this ease of play is the system of on-screen prompts it uses to show you when an action can be taken.  In all other games you end up walking around randomly bumping into or clicking on everything in sight (walls, rocks, objects, etc) to find out what you can do, where you can go, etc.  In this game you can only take an action when the on-screen icons appear for the required action - no guessing involved.  Some may feel this makes the game too easy, but I found it to be just right.  As the game progresses things become less & less obvious and you will walk around sometimes wondering what to do as the prompts are not always easy to find.  Lest you think I'm a wimpy gamer I have completed PS2 games such as God of War I & II, Burnout 3, Black, King Kong, many Medal of Honor titles, etc.  I have grown tired over the years of this traditional style however, and it's caused me to kind of sour on gaming in general.  (I have recently gotten much more into gaming recently due to the ""pick up and play"" immediacy of my iphone games vs. the endless hours needed to play a console game).

About 2/3 through the game as I got tired of it a bit (this does happen when play straight through over two days!) I did refer to an online guide a few times to keep it moving, but it's really not necessary.

The game is not ""Lego Star Wars"" easy by any means - there are plenty of parts where you will die repeatedly to pass (generous autosave points take most of the chore out of this) but the point is you will pass them after 5-10 tries as they all feel doable rather than impossible.

My 6-year old son played through the opening training parts and LOVED it (how cool is throwing your whip to wrap around a German soldier's feet, then pulling him toward you, or using the whip to pull down a log shelter onto an enemy).
At first I thought the game was too hard for him (and it is a bit violent with the fighting & shooting), but halfway through the game he joined me and we traded off playing (I did the gun shooting scenes which are more difficult).  He passed plenty of areas without my help.  Again, I don't want to make the game sound to easy (if a 6-year old can do it) - there are plenty of challenges, and the fun factor is high even if you can play through the game fairly quickly.

-- Great orchestral soundtrack.  It never gets old seeing Indy make a daring escape and hearing the John Williams theme come in.

-- Lots of familiar/similar moments from all the movies, but none feel like annoying rip-offs - just appropriate tributes & fun stuff instead.

-- the Gamespot review mentions terrible graphics & motion controls.  I was not bothered by either.  I'm used to PS2 games rather than PS3 or Xbox 360, but the graphics are fine (I don't have high expectations for the Wii anyway).  Fun gameplay is much more important to me than flashy graphics.  The motion controls generally worked fine.  You do just flail away sometimes in fights but this can be fun in its own way.

Cons:
-- limited replay value - after playing through I'm not sure I'd play through again.  I'd recommend renting the game, but if you bought it you could resell it easily.
-- Lame story (didn't really bother me, as it combined so many cool ""Indy-style"" locations, events, etc)
-- may be too easy for hardcore gamers as noted above, but still a fun play for anyone
-- load times seem too long in scenes where you die repeatedly","Great Fun - Highly Recommended (better as a rental however, poor replay value)",1252713600,,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii'},

*Download and update the drivers (for Vista, especially).
*Download and update the firmware after updating the drivers.

If you don't do this you'll run into compatibility issues with Vista and the keyboard won't work until Windows loads (i.e. can't press keys for BIOS or Windows boot menu).  The firmware fixes this issue and the drivers that come with the unit are not Vista compatible, so they fail to install properly.  A serious gamer is going to download the latest updates anyway, but I wanted to make it clear that the keyboard was originally released for Windows XP and not Vista, so drivers had to be written for Vista.

The functionality of the keyboard consists of 10 customizable keys (5 left, 5 right) that you can set macros on.  The keys are backlit and can be changed out for a set of included keys that have various pictures on them (for gaming).  On the right are play options for Windows Media Player (and others), shuffle and volume.  On the left there is a home key that brings up your default browser.  Rotate, zoom and 100% keys can be set to work with the Windows picture viewer, Photoshop and a few others.

The Home, End, Delete, Page Up and Page Down keys take some getting used to as the Delete key is huge and the End key is higher than it normally is.  Another thing I noticed is the offset at which I had to place the keyboard in order to type with the home keys.  As with any keyboard, it takes time to get used to a key layout and this isn't an issue in my opinion.

The keyboard takes a minimalist approach to gaming, but caters to the professional gamer with nice programmable features.  Some gamers like fancy key layouts and loads of oddball looking gadgets.  The Tarantula bypasses the fluff and goes right to the source--giving you what you need as a gamer and not stuffing the keyboard with items that you won't use anyway.

I changed from a Zboard (which still functions just fine) to this keyboard for a change in pace.  If you're a serious gamer looking for a sleek approach to a gaming keyboard then this is probably going to satisfy your needs.

5.0,False,"08 22, 2004",A3K6W8NERKFI3G,B00005ME7X,Talduras,"First off, let it be known that I have played the initial release of this game when it was on the NES (Nintendo Entertainment System).  It was the first truely great RPG I have ever had the fortune to play, keeping in mind that I'd played Dragon Warrior 1 before that (not a fan of 1 vs 1 combat) and that I don't really consider Legend of Zelda an RPG (Action/Adventure in my book).  The game was long, fun, and an amazingly deep in story for a game that old.  Only problem is it was a rental and I didn't get to finish it (I was on the last battle too).

Fast forward 11 years...

I bought a copy of this game on Amazon.com Marketplace for the GBC, since I knew I'd enjoy it again.  That was truer than I expected.

The core gameplay is all here, so any fans of the NES version will love this one as much, if not more.  Like most Japanese RPGs, the combat is turn-based and consists of standard fantasy elements.  Swords, magic, and several monsters to fight (including the well known slimes, who always feel the need to grin despite the fact that you'll run them through).  What amazes me is the amount of tactics involved in battles compared to other recent RPGs, such as the Final Fantasy games.  The FF games rarely give you a run for your money in standard fight (perhaps with the exception of FF4), but with DW3 almost any battle has the potential to go horribly wrong, making you struggle to win.  Most notable is when status effects are involved.  Sometimes you'll find that your entire party has been put to sleep by a spell, or someone can be paralyzed, or a monster will boost their defense.  Each of these has a counter, but sometimes you'll run into the bad luck of having it happen to the wrong person or that you didn't plan ahead of time with the right items to remove the effect.  Running is always an option, but you take your chances with this, as a failed run will leave you open to more damage.

The graphics are much improved.  This is the first game in the series I've seen with animated sprites for the enemies, and those are amazingly fluid.  The rest of the graphics are improved as well, and make it seem almost SNES quality at times.  The amount of items is greatly expanded, and item management is a lot easier thanks to a bag shared by the party that you can put everything in (you won't have access to those items during combat, though).  Plus, there are several bonus touches, like a mini-game called Pachisi where you can earn bonus items (and most of them are pretty good items at that, like weapons), as well as two bonus dungeons, though unlocking the second one is a rather painful process requiring you to collect 144 unique monster medals... and those rarely appear after finishing of a monster.

If you've never heard of the series, and you're a fan of turn-based battles, this game is certainly a worthy introduction to the series.  You'll wonder why this game series hasn't gotten huge sales numbers anywhere except Japan.  Even more so if you've had the chance to play DWIV",A Classic Game in an Under-Appreciated Series.,1093132800,4,{'Platform:': ' Game Boy Color'},

It has one introduction (Tomahna), one lesson (Jnanin), and three prerequisite (Voltaic, Amateria, Edanna) ages that, when solved, will lead you to the Narayan age. Solving the Narayan age will return you to Tomahna, and your quest is completed. The Voltaic, Amateria, and Edanna ages may be played in any order. The Amateria age was my personal favorite. Its scenes were so spectacular that they reminded me of why I loved Myst. My only objection was that the Narayan age is too short. I wanted to ride in the gondola with Saavedro when he returned to his home city. But this objection also shows Exile's high gaming quality. Even after hours of play, you simply don't want this game to end.

Story: 10/10
The story of this game is amazing! It's EXTREMELY well written.
Vito Scaletta is making a name for himself on the streets of Empire Bay. He's someone who can be trusted to get a job done. Together with his buddy, Joe, he is working to prove himself to the Mafia, quickly escalating up the family latter with crimes of larger reward, status and consequence.....the life as a wise guy isn't quite as untouchable as it seems.

You will find out, life as a wise guy isn't as great as you think.
The story is told through amazing cut scenes and is the main focus of the game.

One of the best videogame stories EVER!

Graphics: 9.6/10
The city and cars are extremely well detailed and really capture the 40s and 50s feel of the game. It looks real. It's filled with propaganda and realistic citizens walking about their day. But, then you shoot them in the face and they die. It's all good, though
The characters all animate well and look great.
The physics engine is what really make the graphics stand out! It's amazing.
The PC obviously has the best physics, but the xbox 360 uses them well, too.
The Ps3 version lacks some graphical items, but it has extra content, so whatever platform you get it on, you'll be pleased with it.

-Sound: 10/10
The voice acting is top notch Hollywood blockbuster movie quality. It's excellent.
The music that plays on the radio stations are very accurate and really give it that 40's- 50's feel.
The guns, cars and everything else sound great too.
Top-notch sound quality.

-Gameplay: 9/10
Before I explain this section, let me establish a fact, here.
 IT'S NOT GTA! NOT GTA! It's barely and open world game. DO NOT expect GTA.
It's a linear story driven game told through chapters. You can go about and kill random people and avoid cops, just like GTA, but it's clearly NOT the main focus.
Now, that's out of the way we can talk about the gameplay.

Spit into 4 sections: Driving, Shooting, fist fighting, and stealth

-Driving:  You will drive a lot in this game.
A mixture of fun and realism, this game does the driving right. You can get fined for speeding and the old cars have realistically bad handling. Don't worry, it's good when you get used to it.
There are chase scenes and the police are very good at annoying you.
They're like ""Oh, I'm police, I'm useful in this game, I'm gonna try and stop you! YAY!""
-Shooting: It's a third person cover shooter. The cover system works well, you can take cover on almost anything and the weapons are correct for the time period. The destructible cover and cover mechanics make the battles realistic and fun.
It's nothing new, but it's fun and fits this game nicely.
There are quite a selection of pistols, shotguns, grenades, and machine guns in the game for you to buy and take from dead people.
You get to kill things with a Tommy gun! It's a TOMMY GUN!! Whoo!
-Fist fighting-
Hand to hand combat is very simple, you can heavy attack, light attack and dodge. And there are some combos and counters that you can do as well.
Simple, but solid and enjoyable.
-Stealth
There are a few stealth sequences and you can silently take out guards and drag there body's out of sight. It's nothing deep, but there is some thought involved.

Overall the gameplay is nothing new, but what it does, it does extremely well and competes with other titles with similar gameplay. The controls are great and it's all enjoyable and extremely well-made.

Fun/enjoyment: 10/10
This game is one of the most enjoyable experiences (yeah, I'm calling it an experience, not a game.) I've ever played. The storyline is very engrossing and you just get so immersed in the game world, you feel like you're in the `40s and then the `50s. The gameplay is very fun and I was never bored. I enjoyed every second of this game from start to finish. This game is SO enjoyable! Did I mention it's enjoyable? By the way, it's enjoyable!

Value/replayablity: (8/10)
This is the only thing this game lacks. It's not very open-world-ish, even though you can rob shops, have police chases, and steal and sell cars to people for a little extra cash.
When, it's over, it was so good, you want more and you long for more. It's weird, but you just feel like you need to play more Mafia 2 after it ends.
There are many collectables and achievements to extend the game's time, if you like that sort of thing.

The game is $30-20 now, depending on which Amazon decides to price it at the moment. This is one of those games where however much it costs, after playing it; it feels worth it because it was so good.
Even said it lacks a lot of replay value and open world elements. Would I say it's worth it? Yes, I think it is.
If you're unsure about the $30 wait until 20. You could probably beat it in a rent(it's about 12-15 hours), but I recommend supporting 2K and this game.

Overall:9.4/10
This game has one of the best stories and solid gameplay to go along with it. It's very immersive, has great graphics and sound design, and is easily one of the most enjoyable games I've played.

I recommend this game to fans of great story-driven games with AMAZING plots. Or, if you like the Mafia and have ever wanted to experience what it's like without actually joining the Mafia. This game may not be for everyone.

1) GAMEPLAY - 5/5 - The intuitive battle system, though not completely original, is a large factor in this game.  I was never an RPG fan (in fact, the first RPG I ever bought was Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga), but this game served as a catalyst for future RPG buys.  This game will always be at the top of my list; it is arguably the best third-party exclusive [USA] title available on the GameCube.  I'm gonna buy Baten Kaitos, Namco's next exclusive GCN title.

2) GRAPHICS - 5/5 - Though I wasn't too enamored by those odd-looking monster avatars on the world map screen, the graphics in this game were astounding.  I loved The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker (in fact, I have all the Zelda titles on the GCN), and I admired its use of cel-shading.  My opinion is not any different with this game.

3) MUSIC - 5/5 - I can honestly call myself an audiophile.  I love video game soundtracks!!  This game's music is up there with Zelda, Perfect Dark, Halo, and Final Fantasy.  It's not perfect, but it gives the game the foreshadowing aura it needs.  Still, many of the tracks are high-quality composition, which makes this game's soundtrack highly listenable (for lack of a better word).

4) GENERAL AUDIO - 4.8/5 - The game's sounds were fitting to the game.  Though not perfect (for example, when Lord Forcystus falls into the pit with an unemotional, ""Aaaaah.""), it does a very good job of incorporating emotion into this game, as that is what this game is good at.  Of course, like any game, you have some generic sounds (""Bliiiiing!!""), but it does not take a large toll on the game's sound.

5) STORY - 6/5 - Yes, I gave it a 6.  Why, you ask?  It simply has the most plot twists that I have ever seen in a video game, and they don't take away from the story!!  Obviously, the latter is the most important.  The story is the most important element in a game.

CK2 is a Historical game with appropriate limits to everyone's actions, even yours! You must have a just cause for war, and so much of the game revolves around inheriting claims, or fighting infidels (people of another religion) and heretics (people whose faith is almost, but not quite, exactly the same as your religion) who you can attack to your heart's content.  Obviously.

If you want to be plopped down at the dawn of modern western culture in Europe, or the late evening of culture in the middle east and Mediterranean, this is your game. Play any Christian lord from Russia to Iceland from any date 1066-1337 (the leet year!) and keep playing until 1453. Start as a count and work your way up to King, or start as King or Emperor and see whether your scheming children kill each other off before someone decent can inherit.  Don't put yourself in the same position as the new York Times reviewer (who had to assassinate his son and grandsons to avoid Game Over), though I do recommend playing an Irish Duke (to learn the game) as he did.

This is a wonderfully personal game. You're not a country, you're a specific person.  From the day you take over to the day you die there is ""you"". Then you become another specific person, your heir (be sure to check your prison when you take over, it's very embarrassing to rule for three years as I did when ""my"" grandson inherited, and only then discover that it is no longer your scheming daughter-in-law who has been in prison that whole time - ""Mom!  Sorry, my bad"").  Groom your heir well and the next ""you"" will be a well-loved, charitable, honest leader with great stats.  Do poorly, or worse yet let your computer-controlled son raise your grandson, and you'll find yourself an inbred kin-slayer who everyone in Chistendom wants to see dead and buried. Which is great, because you'll probably feel the same way.

""My lord, your wife is plotting to kill you!""

""<under breath> Finally! <to wife> Honey, have I mentioned how fat you've become lately?""

This is one of the few games where you're likely look at your own character now and then and say ""why won't you just die already?!""  CK2 is almost infinitely replayable.  You can have a great time in a dozen or more games without leaving Ireland and Iberia.  The music is fantastic, the graphics quite good.  This is my first Paradox game where I play on the ""main"" (pretty) map and not some other information-rich but fairly dull map.

Paradox has reached a new level of quality.  I have to think that anyone who enjoyed the Europa Universalis or Hearts of Iron series is going to be thrilled with the next iteration.  Victoria 2 was miles ahead of the original, and so is CK2 over CK1.  But until EU4 or HoI4 comes out, this is the best Paradox game ever. Highly recommended.

Without giving too much away, the story takes place in a wasteland known as the Junkyard, which is a sort of purgatory.  Six tribes fight an endless war, with the victorious tribe promised entry into a place called Nirvana.  The war ceases to be endless in the opening scene, where the rules of the game are suddenly changed by a little ""divine intervention"" if you will...

The soundtrack of the game is excellent and unique, featuring a whole lot of electric guitar.

Battles are a unique twist on traditional RPG battle systems.  You have your basic attack, as well as spells and special attacks (which drain HP instead of MP).  You learn spells and passive abilities on a grid which slightly resembles that of Final Fantasy X.  What makes the battle system most unique, however, is the ""press turn"" system, which is a clever system that basically allows you to steal turns from your enemies by exploiting their weaknesses.

As for graphics, the game looks great.  Cutscenes look even better and are complemented by some of the best voice-acting I've heard in a while.",Challenging RPG with a refreshingly dark story,1261180800,,,

This bundle comes with Assassin's Creed 3 game, the new PS3 a super slim which is just like the name says it is slimmer, 1 controller with its USB cable, normal composite video (white, yellow, red), a 30 day free trial of Playstation Plus membership.

Now what does entitle this Playstation plus membership you are talking about? First you need to know that the online service on your PS3 is FREE, you can play online or download from the PSN store anything without any extra cost of some kind (of course items that are free).

What does it means to have a Plus membership? It entitles you to have cloud saving which is a useful feature in case your unit is damaged or if you use more than one PS3, it enables you to turn on automatic features like syncing of trophies, saves, patch for games and system updates, demos, trailers, etc. And lastly but not least, it gives you full access to full game trials and full free PS3/PSVita games (which changes each month)and even gives you more discounts on already items on sale.

Does this means this free games I get with a Plus membership are mine to keep?
Yes, it is. It will be yours till the ends of times or if Sony belly ups lol . BUT it will be playable as long as you are a plus member, for example Infamous 2 is free for Plus Members you have to add it to your cart and checkout like any paid transaction but instead they won't charge you a cent for it. What I do myself if I don't feel like playing the game at the moment I just checkout with the game and download it when I feel like it that way even if the offer expires I already owned the game.
Now you redeemed your Plus membership voucher you will have 30 days to play those games, when it expires it will say that you cant play them till you renew your subscription but it doesnt matter if a year from now you renew your subscription once owned is yours.

What this doesnt include:

-Vertical stand as in the picture
-HDMI cable
-Mics

What I suggest you to get:

-Official PS3 wireless headset (I own them) or the PULSE Elite edition (cant comment on this ones don't own them)

your wife or GF, your kids, your dog and even those crappy neighbors next door will be glad you have one of this for those late gaming sessions.

-HDMI cable

5.0,False,"05 26, 2015",A1MLORAB3BT2MN,B00WTI3JPE,CROWNED ONE,"I really don't know where to start.  This game is great.  Hands down one of the best RPG's I have played to date, and one of my top games so far.  When getting this game I decided I was going to do something I never do, and that is play on the hardest setting from the onset.  This was and is the best decison for anyone trying to play this game.

 First let me start with a few problems.

There is some slight stutter in the graphics at time.  I mostly notice this in my minimap.  Not game breaking.  Swimming is an absolute chore.  The controls for this are not great, but fortunately this isn't a swimming game so I manage this aspect. Riding a horse can be a hassle but I found out there is an auto ride mode.  There have also some quest problems that I hope will be address later.  One I have personally come across is freeing a merchant from a cage.  I kill the enemies but no key.

Now to why this game is great.  Overall the witcher excells at blending the story and side quests.  It truely make you feel like you are apart of a world in turmoil not just from the ravages of war, but from the beast that also reside there.  I really enjoy the combat.  I hear a lot of complaints about the controls.  Personally I don't see anything wrong with them.  It takes a bit of getting used to,but it is in no way game breaking and once you get combat down it really makes for some dramatic fights.  No auto lock on the way you are accustomed...so be prepared to make adjustments and sometimes flat out running to get your bearings.

Oh yes the fights, especially the boss fights.  They are AWESOME.  (again play on Death March).  You must utilize your skills as a gamer to find the best way to defeat some of these beast and they offer no forgiveness if you choose to think you can hack and slash your way to victory.  I would like to think that the nature of the Witcher is one with his life always on the line be it from monster or human. Death march ensures that.  Heck even the mini card game is great.

Gamers this is an excellent purchase and well worth the time to play.  If you want something simple this is not for you. I hope others are enjoying this as much as I am.

5.0,False,"01 10, 2003",A1TGXBJ96E9B8B,B000067DPJ,James M. Stafford III,"Pro Race Driver is definitely an above-average simulation-style auto racing game.  It can best be compared with Gran Turismo 3 in relation to the number of circuits in the game (some of which must be unlocked), although Gran Turismo 3 definitely has the upper hand in terms of the photorealistic graphics and the sheer number of vehicles.  However, whereas Gran Turismo 3 has literally HUNDREDS of races and race series, there is no connecting thread or storyline to the game, and this is where Pro Race Driver truly shines.
Pro Race Driver's Career Mode has the player enacting the racing life of Ryan McKane.  The game's opening film shows a young Ryan and his older brother at a race and watching their near-legendary father die in a horrifying accident.  Fifteen years later, Ryan gets his first shot at a big-time auto racing series.  All this is done with nice cinematic cutscenes which sometimes includes cutscenes with rival drivers and team managers based upon the on-track racing actions.
With forty-two licensed cars as well as thirty-eight licensed circuits from around the world, Ryan will have A LOT to overcome (including - and perhaps ESPECIALLY - his own ego) to become a legendary race car driver in his own right, surpassing even the racing community's high expectations of his deceased father.  Unfortunately, Pro Race Driver does not include qualifying (this is the one major downfall of the game), so the player is stuck with wherever she or he is placed on the starting grid by the CPU.
Career Mode operates on the tier system.  Tier 1 race series use the slowest cars in the game, whereas higher-tier race series use faster and more powerful cars.  Again, there are certainly not nearly as many cars as in Gran Turismo 3, but Pro Race Driver does offer a good variety of cars nonetheless.  Progressing to higher tiers of race series unlocks both the race circuits and the race cars of each progressive tier, and this immediately takes effect in all gameplay modes.
In Free Race Mode, however, the available cars for a given circuit depends on WHERE in Free Race Mode the player selects one or more circuits to use.  The top of the Free Race Mode track selection screen is divided by race series; if one or more tracks are selected from within a race series, only those vehicles which can be used in the series will be available for selection.  If the player selects a track from the Freestyle section at the very bottom of the track selection screen, then all unlocked cars are available to the player.
One of the nice things about Gran Turismo 3 is the ability to truly fine-tune each vehicle.  While Pro Race Driver does not have nearly as many tuning options, it does offer quite enough options to take a car from extreme oversteer to extreme understeer.
Pro Race Driver does not use rules; in other words, there are no official repercussions (such as ten-second penalties or immediate disqualifications) for unsportsmanlike or dangerous driving, shortcutting corners, etc.  Many corners (especially chicanes) do have barriers to ensure that all drivers (including the player) keep to the racing line, and there are plenty of sand traps and gravel traps to significantly slow cars which go off-line at many corners, but this is really the extent of the implementation of any 'rules' in Pro Race Driver.
The PlayStation2 features 256 levels of button sensitivity (for the X, Square, Circle, and Triangle buttons), and Pro Race Driver makes definite use of this feature (but fortunately NOT to the extreme of Total Immersion Racing).  Pressing harder on the accelerator button (set to the X button as the default) will provide faster acceleration; pressing harder on the brake button (set to the Square button as the default) will provide harder braking (but pressing too hard induces wheel-lock).
Pro Race Driver seems to be best suited to a player who prefers a slightly- to somewhat-loose car, meaning that the back end tends to swing about.  This means that drift-style racing is quite feasible for those skilled in this highly-specialized driving technique, and that plenty of countersteering will be required at most race venues.  However, there are certainly enough tuning parameters that a player with good knowledge of car tuning can truly adapt virtually any vehicle in the game to a given circuit.
There are several bonus codes available for Pro Race Driver.  These are entered in the Bonus folder of the Options file cabinet.  Codemasters provides two bonus codes simply for registering the game and for Code M (Codemasters' online newsletter concerning its current and upcoming games, combined with its special members-only section of the Codemasters Web site); without giving anything away (hopefully), these two bonus codes definitely make the game a little more challenging, especially on tight street circuits such as Vancouver.
Overall, players will likely be spending A LOT of time with Pro Race Driver.  To my knowledge, this game has the highest number of real-world race venues of all auto racing games available for PlayStation2; this fact alone makes it an excellent ""collectors' item"" for diehard racing gamers.  Some of the circuits in Pro Race Driver include Hockenheim (both the short and long versions), Monza, Fuji, Aida, Zolder, Silverstone, Donington Park, Brands Hatch (two configurations), Nurburgring, and many, many more.  The ability to truly customize races and even race series within Free Race Mode adds tremendous replayability to Pro Race Driver, in a way that Gran Turismo 3 and other PS2 racing games simply cannot achieve.",The Best Racing Game Yet for PS2!!!,1042156800,4,,

Let me talk about the graphics first. Overall this is a very tight looking package. Textures, normal mapping, the works. It ranks up there with the F.E.A.R.'s and Half Life 2's of the world. The only problem is that the game slows down (on pc, no slowdown on Xbox 360 version) when alot of smoke is on screen. But when your in the smoke, you don't notice much because you cant see that well. A great looking game all around.

The sound in the game is good as well. There are a couple of problems, but for now Ill stick to the good. The voiceovers are top notch. They are done by many actors from the Band of Brothers series. Its funny, you can notice that its Malarky, Garneir, Pencala, and others voices in the game. Adds a good feel to the sound. The battle sounds are great also. Guns sound great for the most part, and explosions and what not all sound great. Music is great as well. There are a couple of problems with the sound though. One, the battle chatter system always sounds like your fellow soldiers are no more then 2 feet away, when, like on the Pointe du Hoc level, your 100 feet ubove them. This takes away from the realisim of the game for me. Also, the Thompson and M1Garand sounds aren't that good. Thompson sounds week, unlike the powerful .45 cal ACP round it fires. The M1 sounds to crackly also, where the actual gun sounds more popish, in terms of gun sounds.

One good thing about the game is that all the levels are intense, from start to finish. It never lets up. The only thing is the health system. It is very reminesent of the Halo 2 health system, but without the Sci-Fi setting. The realisim was undercut here as well. I was kind of dissapointed they went with more of an arcade like feel with the health. I think they should have made a medic that you could get health from as well as the health packs. This would have also kept the pace of the game up, without the backtracking for health like in the first.

If you aren't sick of FPS, or WWII games, go pick this one up. If you like arcade feeling WWII games, this is the game for you. If you want realisim, this probably isn't the best choice for you. Get the first Brothers in Arms if you want realisim. If you like intense, frantic, out of controll squad based combat, pick this one up as soon as you can. The Collectors Edition, in my opinion, is worth a little extra chedder.

One of the first things you'll notice when you load up Lumines is that it has a somewhat retro set of graphics, borderline primitive. In fact, at any given moment you'll be looking at a tile of small blocks of two different colors or patterns and a neat background. And that's it. But that is part of the charm - it's a very sharp looking game as the colors and patterns are nice and vibrant as well as interesting without being overly distracting.

The music is one of the real strong points of Lumines. In fact, the soundtrack is one of the most appealing aspects of the game. As you play the game, the music is generated a bit differently based on how well you're doing.  This keeps things from being too repetitive and makes for an enjoyable gaming experience even for extended periods.

What about the game play? Well this is where Lumines really shines. It's a wonderful game even for those who don't usually enjoy puzzle games. The game consists of two main modes. One of them, called Puzzle mode has you tasked with building assigned shapes. This provides a nice challenge and change of pace from the main mode. In this mode you're tasked with racking up lots of points by forming blocks of 4 out of the same color. The kicker is those blocks aren't instantly cleared out they're cleared out by a bar which is set to the rhythm of the music so there is a deeper level of strategy involved.

This game had a very bad initial week and a half, but all MMOs do. I got on more often than not, but my friends weren't so lucky. So you couldn't play your game for 80 hours in the first week only to shelve it a week later. I was as excited as anyone and I had more than enough games to keep me busy while I waited(Tales of Xillia for one). Get over it.

That said, all MMO players who play on PCs who have played games dating back to Everquest and have come to understand and expect a shifty launch at best. No MMO has ever launched perfectly, even WoW(WoW enthusiasts would have you believe otherwise. I played from launch. It was messed up too). They promised the issue would be resolved as close to 100% as possible on 9/4 and I can absolutely confirm it has been. There is a specific reason IGN, Gamespot, etc. all wait weeks of gameplay to discern a numerical score and verdict on the game. They can't possibly do so over the course of the launch week. They're always congested, over-populated and nearly unplayable because these companies undershoot their estimation of how many players there will be.

The game itself is pretty much as expected. It's very much like WoW or Guild Wars in terms of accessibility and ease of play. The game is entirely soloable except for the obvious raids and dungeons. Grouping is made easy by using the in-game duty system which simply auto groups players who sign up for the same quest. It makes it very simple to find groups.

Combat, for the most part, is not dissimilar from any other MMO, but still enjoyable. The basic jobs, ie Tank, Healer, and DPS are all represented with minor variations. I do find I like the tank class a bit better in this game because they can always do a fair bit of DPS. There are wrinkles in many classes, plus the ability to use skills from a second class(not unlike Guild Wars), that make them more interesting. A lot of what makes the combat interesting lies in their use of different things that need to be done while in boss battles. There come in many varieties like fighting adds that need to be killed, or destroying a certain object before they do their instant kill move, basically the regular ones anyone who played the WoW expansions will know. It does weed out some players who can't seem to do anything but press buttons, which is a positive.

If you played FFXI, like I did, you'll find a lot to love here. They continued the same world, races, and even most of the enemy models are the same. The game is nowhere near as difficult or grindy though, which I love. The endgame content does seem to have plenty of difficulty though. Basically they made the game more like WoW so that players could solo to the max and once you reach the high level dungeons and stuff, you will absolutely need to know what you're doing, not unlike FFXI. It's kind of like the best of both worlds for lovers of FFXI.

The music is actually a step above too. Many of the boss fights have some of the best music I've heard in a FF game since FFVI. I don't know why people would complain about the graphics either, they're the same as any other AAA title currently out. The art style, bosses, and the beautiful world is what you come for. Not 100% sharpness and mouth animations.

To me, the main draw is the world and story though. Sure, a lot of the game is like every other MMO out there, but you don't play the other ones expecting a revolution. You play them to experience a new world. This game is no different, except FF's world is second to none and this game is no exception. Not to mention over half the players are PS3 players, ie people who have never played an MMO so this is new to them. Very rarely do I care about stories in MMOs, but this is one time where I do and it delivers an interesting one.

All in all it's exactly what I expected. It's a great MMO that will be something to stick to for a while. If they can deliver even half the amount of amazing content they did with FFXI in this game, players will want to experience every drop. And now that they've fixed the server issue, it's 100% playable.

5.0,True,"02 16, 2010",AVSBDSGQGHDE8,B001IK5TJI,Robert W. Vanackooy,"I've played many roll-playing games all the way back to the original Might and Magic series and Bard's Tale and this game is as good as I've ever played.  Lots of variety of equipment and characters that seem to come alive on the TV screen.  I found myself caring very much for my party members, because their conversations and comments made them seem very real.  If you are a male character, you'll be hard pressed not to want the rogue/bard Leliana alongside you in all fights.  Her wonderful voice and fetching beauty is more than matched by her fighting and thieving skills.  On top of that, you can include the witch Morrigan in your party, who is voiced by Claudia Black of Farscape/Stargate SG-1 fame.  There is even a golem that you can get (through one of the downloadable add-ons) to join your party.

There is a casual game mode, that allows your party members to recover fully from combat (other than an injury, which can be quickly healed by a potion), even if they fell and appeared dead.  If all your party members die, you do go back to the last save position.  Hard-core gamers can choose more difficult modes that will make the quests more realistic and definitely harder to complete.

Saves are allowed almost anywhere.  A good use of the save feature can allow you to try another approach to a problem or go right back at the monster that just defeated your whole party.

Conversation options and choices made through the game DO make a difference on how the game will play out.  Thus, there is a pretty good replay value in this game.  Your conversations can determine how party members feel about you and can even lead to romance.  Some party members will openly question your choices, but you can give them gifts to quell their negative views.

The graphics are outstanding.  At times, I wish I could have just sat back and watched some of the battles, but I was a bit involved with killing my enemies.

I'm sure that various aspects of the game have already been described in previous reviews, so I won't delve into the game mechanics and controls.  There was nothing about the gameplay that tempted me to cut short my experience and move onto some other game.  This game fully hooked me right up till the final credits.

I'm looking forward to future sequels of this game.  I found myself getting lost for hours and hours playing Dragon Age:Origins.  I even jumped back in to play it again after I finished it.  This is a richly rewarding gaming experience with a deep, involving story, great characters, and enough good old fashioned fighting to keep you glued to the TV for hours and hours and days and days.",Totally hooked on this game.,1266278400,2,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",
5.0,False,"03 31, 2012",A2TCG2HV1VJP6V,B00065CIGS,Ryan Sil. (Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev),"===SONIC 3===
You totally adored the first two Sonics. Now what is that you will expect from this sequel? Well, most of the action remains the same, except that like any good sequel, it improves upon the original gameplay GREATLY. Now we have ELEMENTAL shields, that give you a special power to go with you being a bit more invulnerable. For example, the Bubble Shield allows you to breathe underwater and bounce, while the Fire Shield has no effect against fiery projectiles. The game also allows Tails to fly, so when you're playing as him, it can reaaally help when it comes to certain tight spots.

The worlds in this game are more colorful and lively than ever, as well as including even more flashy speed and gimmicks. TO top it off, the levels are actually much longer than in the previous installments. No more are the levels a mere 30 seconds. Now they range from 2-6 minutes! Although I'd feel a bit desperate about finishing a level at times, it's still pretty cool to get to experience everything a bit more! Want to take a break? There's a save feature. In fact, there are LOTS of save files.
Oh yes. Did I forget to mention that Michael Jackson helped out for the game's soundtrack?
===Sonic and Knuckles===
Literally Sonic 3: Part 2, Sonic and Knuckles is more of the same, except without Tails. Thankfully, the new zones are just as much fun to explore as that of Sonic 3's. Other than that, it's just like Sonic 3, as well as just as hugely fun.

This Windows 95 release of the two games is a pretty good one. The music is composed of MIDIs, but they sound pretty amazing. Plus, you can play the combined ""Sonic 3 & Knuckles"", which allows you to play through both games as if they were one, without the need of the original S&K cartridge's ""Lock-on technology""",Lovin' this Windows 95 release!,1333152000,,,

First off, shipping from this company is in no way rapid. I suppose I might be a little bias since I am used to prime, but it did take this company 3 days from the moment of purchase to ship the control. Ultimately, no big deal, the control did arrive within Amazon's allotted window, and it was well packaged.

The various functions of the control are very easy to use and program, and also not a problem to switch up on the fly for games like GOW and COD. Where this product shines the most (especially on BO2) is using the far more powerful semi-auto weapons using rapid fire. If you were a fairly decent COD player before, this function alone will no doubt up your game. However, I would caution you to be prepared to have people in various lobbies complaining that you are using a moded controller. While the device is not detectable as far as microsoft is concerned, your fellow COD players are not stupid either. They know unless you have a serious meth habit there is no way in hell you can get off rounds that fast. Just a heads up.

Drop shot, which forces your player to the ground after firing the first round, is also handy on certain maps that are fairly wide open, and if you are more of a ""rusher"" styled player. If you are the type that is constantly taking a knee behind cover, or if you like to camp constantly, this will not be an advantage to your style of play. If fact, it will probably get you killed a great deal.

The jitter function is handy when you are in a confined space and will be firing from the hip (as it will not allow you to aim down the sight). You can spray an entire room with an SMG at a rate of fire that is astounding. This also, proves highly useful on certain maps.

as far as the build of the control? It is well made and manufactured, and these folks obviously take pride in their workmanship. I have had no problems hooking up my Turtle Beach set or my chat pad to the control. The grips are also a welcome edition over your stock 360 control as well.

Overall, I can recommend this control to anybody who is heavily involved in FPS games. It is well built, easy to program, and gives you a definite edge over the competition.",A great addition to your arsenal for a FPS player,1364947200,11,,

5.0,False,"04 14, 2010",AA6K1PDOE130V,B002BSC55M,Ratchet&amp;Spank,"PROS:
- Sexy Design.  Sony really got the aesthetics right on this one.  I think everyone can agree it's a beautiful piece of hardware.  The smaller screen is crystal clear and makes your games and movies look even sharper then the 3000 model.

- 16 gigs internal memory.  Enough room to store plenty of media.  A 16 gig memory stick duo cost around $80 in stores and you get that much storage included in every PSP GO.

- Pause your games.  The Go has a new feature that lets you save your game at any moment and exit to the XMB.  Then you can pick back up right where you left off.  I very nice feature if you're playing on the go. (no pun intended)

- BlueTooth.  You can now use your mobile phone headsets to communicate during online games.  You can even sync your dualshock PS3 controller and control the games through it.  Pretty neat, huh.

CONS:
- No UMD drive.  This is the thing everyone brings up.  With the PSP GO, your only option to get games is to download them from the Playstation Store.  Luckily, most of the best games on the system are available.  You can access them from your PC, PS3, or the PSP GO itself.

- Price.  I'll be the first to admit $250 is a bit pricey.  But considering you get 16 gigs of memory built in, it's really not THAT bad.  You can usually find it even cheaper here on Amazon or if you shop around.  I got my PSP Go for $190 at Target.  I consider that a great deal.

I've had my PSP GO for 2 weeks now and am very happy with it.  If you're in the market for an extremely portable, sleek looking gaming device, then look no further.

**UPDATE**
6 months later, I'm using this thing more then ever.  I've added a 16gig M2 card to maximize it's capacity because I was starting to run out of internal memory.  I've found it makes a great MP3 player and have added about 50 albums so far.  It's loaded with a ton of digital comics, photos, movies, TV shows, and of course GAMES.

This is my very first Real-Time Strategy game and I had trouble at first, but once I got the hang of it I've been plowing away the enemy left and right on every level.

This game is so incredibly fun - my favorite Lord of the Rings game to date.  Once I installed it, I played it for 8 hours straight without realizing I was sitting there that long!  I've had to make a conscious effort to make a chore list when I get home from work because if I don't, nothing gets done because I'm so glued to this game!  Helm's Deep is incredibly difficult and this should be nothing compared to the Battle at Minas Tirith.

If you like RTS games and a big Lord of the Rings fan, this is your game!  One word of caution:  You will need a high-end computer to handle all the details going on.  The battles are fun and exciting; all your favorite characters are here to help out and each one has special powers they gain the higher in rank they become.  If you've done a good job of gaining resources and power-ups, you can actually summon the Ents to Helm's Deep - if you choose.

The sound is fantastic. I am able to hear heavy base along with notes at all spectrums. This fantastic sound has really made my gaming and video streaming experience that much better. It is like hearing a surround sound system inside of my head. It is truly fantastic. There is even a toggle volume on the back of the left ear cup that allows me to easily control the volume up or down when I need to.

The cord is thick and quite durable. The braided material on the outside of the cord really gives it that extra strength. The cord is 7 ft long which really allows me plenty of room to comfortably move around while it's plugged in.

The microphone works well too. I've spoken to friends online while gaming and all of them state that I come through clearly without any distortion or feedback.

My only complaint is that I do wish that it had an inline control on the cord, but I have simply adjusted my gaming to where I do not need it.

If you like collecting items and then finding places to use them to continue the game then this might be your type of game.  For me the plot is the game.  It's like interacting with a book and if the plot is bad so is the game.  I enjoyed Syberia so I was excited to play Syberia II.  I would expect that it is why all the initial reviews are so positive.  If you liked the first one this is more of the same, in fact better because you already know and like the characters.  If you haven't played Syberia I'd suggest that you play it first.  By now it is a bargan bin game and you can tell if you like the story.  The original Syberia does take a while to get started so give it time.
  Syberia fans probably don't need this review so I'll just add some of my observations and possible corrections.  First I found several scenes to dark to  play and had to hunt the pixel to find what I was looking for.  It wasn't that I didn't know what I was looking for it was just to dark to see.  Even adjusting the brightness all the way up on my screen didn't help a lot.  Although this wasn't necessary for the vast majority of the game.
  Several tips.  They have certain puzzles that appear to be trial and error such as the ring of candles but they are not.  A map of the solution to these puzzles is elswhere.  Read everything that you find and use your phone because it can save you a lot of searching and guessing.  If you take your time and experience the game then you can complete it without a hint book or walkthrough.  The object of a good adventure is not to get to the end but to enjoy the trip.",Is the Sequel as Good?,1082073600,3,,

Combining the trademark Vanillaware aesthetic with the role-play brawler aspect of those games, Dragon's Crown delivers a fantastic experience and a first on the Vita. Beyond Vanillaware's involvement, though, there were members of the Guardian Heroes and Code of Princess teams that worked on Dragon's Crown, and a lot of their art's available in the free art book that accompanied launch copies of the game.

As for the game, it has all the elements you'd want out of a role-playing game, so you have tons of loot, leveling up, tons of characters to play as, tons of quests to take on, and hours of hours of content to keep you busy. As for the gameplay, it mostly feels like a beat 'em up, but it all plays very smoothly. I loved Guardian Heroes and Code of Princess, so Dragon's Crown was definitely in my wheelhouse. I'd love to see more games like this.

In terms of graphics, Dragon's Crown is a winner. Combining Vanillaware's beautiful visual approach with the talents of Kinu Nishimura and Gouda Cheese brings the best out of the 2D art, making this one stunning game to see in action.

Overall, Dragon's Crown is one of the Vita's best games.

The ""Commander Edition"" (as it's called on Consoles) includes:

- the full game XCOM: Enemy Unknown (previously released on Xbox360/PC/PS3)
- all previously released DLC & updates (i.e. Operation Slingshot; Elite Soldier Pack)
- the new Enemy Within over-haul (See Below)

And a few unmentioned changes to the game:
- Enemy AI has been greatly improved and enemies are deadlier than ever
- New appearance and language options for soldiers (Russians speaking Russian!)
- Can award medals to soldiers that give unique bonus attributes (e.g. Never Panic, etc)
- Select ""Second Wave"" game-play options unlocked from the start! (very fun)

The Enemey Within part is key as much of the game has been tweaked, vamped up, and generally been improved upon. Enemy Within is absolutely PACKED with new features and more than more than make up for the purchase price (imo). So far I have had only minor issues with game play; I have encountered one glitch that forced me to fail (or reload) on one of the early EXALT missions, an NPC became stuck on a mission and I could not progress. Be very careful on Ironman mode until this is patched. Otherwise, game-play had been phenomenal - just what I've been waiting for!

Do not get me wrong, I loved the original black console, but the fact of the matter is that the gloss black HDD cover is prone to scratching. Big time. Even the slightest wipe from a microfiber cloth causes scratches. I do not understand why Sony chose to implement this type of material when they removed it completely from the PS3 slim. It is like taking a step backwards in innovation. Why Sony, why??? So in a couple of years down the road I would have to purchase a PS4 slim? Most likely.

The Batman PS4 eliminates this problem and is also part of the reason why I decided to purchase this console even though I had the original black PS4. Like the consoled itself, the controller does not have any gloss. It is quite similar to the likes of the urban camo controller in terms of finish.

For the fans who love Batman this is a must. For those who cannot stand the gloss on the original black PS4 the collector edition PS4 seems to be one alternative.

Aside from the color the Batman PS4 is exactly the same as the original with updated internals that functions more or less as the original.

I'll say this now: I'm not a fan of the Resident Evil games. I'm no pansy that hates being scared but it's kind of hard to get scared when you're packing a pump shotgun.(Geez you came out of nowhere! Now die Punk <Fire shotgun at their face>). Not totally exciting. But for some reason I just had to play Resident Evil 4. Could be a bit of a drought in games lately(I've beaten MGS3, Metroid Prime 2 and San Andreas, don't have Xbox to play Halo 2). And after picking it up, it's a stellar entry into a series I kind of despise.

Story: Takes place in 2004, 6 years after Raccoon City was nuked to stop the T-Virus from spreading. Once a rookie cop during that time, Leon Kennedy is now an agent who receives an assignment: rescue the President's daugther, Ashley. While there, he finds a man in a cabin who doesn't take too kindly to strangers and attacks Leon. Leon is then attacked by a huge horde of them but something's wrong: they're faster, even a bit smarter, using traps and ambushing, even ladders into windows. These aren't the same zombies as before.

Graphics: If not the best then one of the best graphics on any home console. The locations and villages have a strong atmosphere and totally immerses you into it with real-looking environments. And wait till the boss battles, nothing as massive as Quadraxis from Metroid Prime 2(thank god) but they're some of the most cinematic bosses ever.

Sound/Music: A survival/horror games lives or dies(no pun intended) by it's music. If it can immerse you and make you edgy with creeking floorboards, footsteps, distant cries then it'll get you perfectly in tune with the environments. While there's some cases of bad voice acting, it's miles above what the series used to have(no overracted ""Ada!"" here).

Gameplay: If you're a RE fan or not, you'll probably agree with me on this: the control scheme felt busted. It was just awkward. People have compared it to driving a tank. And since the old games used a static camera(never really moved), due to the camera switching to the next scene, your character would now have slightly different controls. Up was always used to move your character forward so if the camera now has you in the background coming to the foreground, your first instinct to go down towards the camera makes you go back to the previous screen but going up was the correct way.

It's finally changed in Resident Evil 4. The camera takes a Splinter Cell-esque approach with the camera just behind Leon's right shoulder. It's not true 3rd person perspective a la Ratchet and Clank or Zelda but it's enough.

Also changed is the dynamics in battles, which are plentiful, sometimes too much so. It's not uncommon to have 10-15 of these...""things"" after you. You can shoot them in the leg to slow them down or drop them to their knees, shoot their arms to drop the weapons, shoot the dynamite they throw so it explodes right in their face or blow their head off with a well-aimed bullet(not always, sometimes they just act as if the bullet grazed their face, holding it in pain). Word of advice: when it's nighttime, DO NOT blow their heads off. Drawers and tables can be moved in front of doors to barricade yourself in for awhile.

Like Shenmue, the A button is context-sensitive which means in certain areas, you can do a specific action. If an enemy has a ladder against a window, you can push it off. If they get too close, you can roundhouse kick them away. You can crouch from too close explosions etc. Aiming is a bit slow but it's a hell of a lot better than previous entries where you couldn't tell if you were directly aiming at them or not until you fired.

As for downsides? The action gets to be too intense at times with a large number coming at you from all sides and since the camera focused directly in front of Leon, you can't see if anyone is running at the sides or behind. There's no strafing(literally walking sideways, controlling Leon is either back, forward or turning) and no dodging like in Nemesis.

You have to switch to your ammo in the menu also. Can't just simply click a button and switch from your grenade to a gun. Your inventory is changed but it's slightly bothersome since your arsenal, first aid sprays and ammo take up space on a grid. Your shotgun takes up a good 3-4 spaces which would be perfect for ammo or herbs(your potions essentially). You can ""level up"" your guns and your attache case(no magically connected item boxes here) so you can carry more stuff. However, none of these cause you to just quit the game entirely, they're just things that'll irk you.

Dust off your Gamecube and pop this in. This is probably the most funnest action games in years and you'll oddly find yourself wanting to blow off some more heads and kill these spanish speaking enemies when you're not playing. Did I mention the controls are changed?",2005 starts with a bang,1105488000,5,,
5.0,False,"12 17, 2015",A1IQV6AI7L9NOK,B0144K8KQW,Feelah the tigress,"I had previously bought a New 3DS XL after waiting ages for the smaller one to be released (of course, as soon as I bought an XL, here comes the release of this one!).  Well, I tried to get used to the XL and while it is a fine enough system, it's a bit too big for my hands and so I decided to jump and get this smaller version despite the fact that I have no interest in Animal Crossing.

I bought my unit used, and it didn't come with the Animal Crossing game code, so I can't comment on the game.  However, I should point out that for anyone who is getting this solely for the console, it doesn't come with any plain white faceplates.  Yes, it comes with TWO sets of faceplates, but they are both Animal Crossing themed and there is no plain white one.  That's a bit of a bummer for anyone who wasn't expecting it, but I imagine you could remedy that by buying new faceplates or getting creative with some spray paint.  I'm personally considering just buying a pretty vinyl decal for it, myself.  Oh, and I should mention for anyone who's expecting it, but the system is not a bright glossy white like you'd expect.  It's a matte off-white, a bit like the color of an old 90's Apple computer monitor (yes, really  it's that exact same shade of grayish-white as old Apple computers).  I actually like this, because it means that it doesn't show fingerprints.

In addition, anyone who's owned the older 3ds and has upgraded to this will note that the screens are a bit larger.  The old 3DS's top screen measures about 3"" across, while the New 3DS's top screen measures just under 3.5"" across.  The old 3DS's bottom screen measures 2.5"" across while the New 3DS's bottom screen is more like 2.75"" across.  Thankfully, though, they are still small enough that games don't look stretched and pixellated like they do on the XL.  As you'd expect, the New 3DS is also a bit physically larger than the old one (the old one measured about about 5.25"" by just under 3"" while the new one measures about 5.5"" by just over 3""  the thicknesses on the units are roughly the same).  I guess what this means is that if you have a carrying case that is very specifically sized for the older 3DS, you may need to pick up a new one.  Just for reference, the New 3DS XL measures about 6.25""x3.5"" overall (widths are similar across all units).  Oh, and for anyone who's curious, here's the weight breakdown between all three units:  the old 3DS weighs 8.2 oz, the New 3DS weighs 8.9 oz, and the New 3DS XL weighs 11.6 oz.

As for other changes between the New 3DS and the older one, well, there are a few.  The new 3D face tracking effect does seem to work better than the older one, but this doesn't help me because I tend to get dizzy/nauseous if I use the 3D effect (I usually keep it turned off), so it's a bit of a moot point.  Another change to the system is some new button placements (I rather like the new position of the power button because it's easier to avoid accidentally pressing) and some altogether new buttons (like the weird little nub on the right side).  Also, the wifi setting is now just a menu setting instead of a physical switch, which I feel neutral about.  I should also note that anyone who has owned the old 3DS model might know about its notorious screen scratch problem where some units would close too tightly and scratch their own screens.  This problem has been fixed for the New 3DS (and the XL unit as well), as the unit is now molded in such a way as to prevent this issue.  The change I like the best, though, is the new auto-brightness feature (which no one ever talks about, strangely).  This is super-handy, as I can go from playing in the dark to in a brightly lit room without having to constantly change the screen settings (it works surprisingly well  I haven't had an issue with it yet).  As for other improvements, I've heard that the processor is better in this, but I haven't really experienced any faster load times (at least that I noticed).  Battery life seems better, but I can't be entirely sure since I didn't scientifically time it or anything.

Unfortunately, there are a few changes that I don't care for.  First off, the new stylus no longer extends, which is a feature I miss.  Hopefully once third-party manufacturers (or Nintendo themselves) catch onto this issue, they will start selling some nice extendable stylus replacements.  Also, the placement of the SD card inside the cover (such that you have to remove the cover to access it) is kind of stupid.  Other than those minor issues, though, I can't really fault the unit for anything.  Lastly, this isn't really a flaw, but I should mention that I ran into an odd problem when I was playing Pokemon Y.  I noticed that the screen would occasionally flicker/dim just a bit for a second or two during certain animations, and it was driving me nuts because I thought there was an issue with my new unit.  I discovered that turning off the ""power saving mode"" in the settings seemed to fix the issue, so I suspect that it was dimming the screen at certain times just to save battery life.  Either way, it's solved now (hopefully if anyone is having a similar issue, this advice will help them out!).

Overall, this seems like a great, solidly built system, and it's nice that Nintendo finally listened to the fans with smaller hands (even if they chose an odd bundle to release this in).  If you don't have a 3DS yet and want to acquire a Nintendo handheld, then this is a great system to jump in with, although if you aren't a fan of Animal Crossing then you'll probably have to pay extra to get some different cover plates (or buy a decal/can of spray paint).  Of course, you could always try to hold out in the hopes that Nintendo releases more colors over here.  As for me, I'm pretty pleased with this system, so I'll just keep mine!",Finally!,1450310400,2,,

This year I abandoned playing the games on PS2 and went and tried them out on XBox 360 instead.

I heard some good things said about NHL 09 and yet the first thing I thought to myself was ""Great, an EA NHL title for an odd year, not a good sign."" (I gave EA's NHL 07 2 stars and didn't review NHL 05 because I thought it was terrible!)

The short version of this review:  This game gave me everything I could have ever asked for and more.

The long version:

I sat down and went over my options and I couldn't believe the DEPTH of the game.  EA has always included the NHL, the SM-Liiga, the Elitserien, and the DEL.  Two years ago they included the Czech Extraliga and last year they included the AHL.  This year... The Kontinental Hockey League and all of it's teams make their EA debut!  Way to go EA for pulling off such a coup!

And that's just for starters.

The controllers have three options:  The NHL 09 settings that are complex but diverse, the ""classic"" settings that make the controls a bit easier without losing all the functions, or the NHL 94 controller settings where you pass/select your player with A and shoot/check with B, just like playing it back in the day (though the disadvantage is losing the ability to change your lines manually, instigate a fight, etc.)  Even controlling the goalies is cool because you can set their positioning and have them prepare to make saves in the butterfly, blocker, or glove.  Pretty nifty if I say so myself.

The Dynasty mode is sufficient as always with two-way contracts, waivers, and truly deep team management (woulda been nice to see a fantasy draft option available but I can overlook that given everything else) and it's easy to get into the games.  But there's one game function that sets the game miles apart from any other hockey title...

The ""Be A Pro"" mode is so ridiculously awesome that after you play it, the game will have you hook line and sinker.  One option is to play as any other professional player of your choice.  Wanna play as Sidney or Alex?  Now you can.  Any position, any player.
The second option, and the most rewarding to me at least, is to create your own character and watching him ascend the ranks!  You'll start of as a prospect on your farm club (so if you choose the Phoenix Coyotes as your team, you get assigned to the San Antonio Rampage) and accomplish your goals over the course of the season.  If you play well, you'll get called up from the farm club and play with the biggest, baddest, and best of the NHL.  Do poorly, and you'll go from NHL star to AHL fourth-liner faster than you can say Alexandre Daigle.  You can sim through those seasons, but don't sim a lot because the game doesn't appreciate it (the AI will have the coach reprimand you if you sim more than you play.  I did this to test it out and while my goalie rocked during the regular season, my backup got the starts come playoff time.  Hmm...)

Any complaints about the game?  Well, I've noted before that the music used to be soft.  The soundtrack now is more metal, but it's more mall-metal (Avenged Sevenfold, Priestess, etc.)  I give EA an A for effort, but 2K just gets better bands on their soundtrack.

All and all though, while I still have to play the 2K title, something tells me that for the first time in 5 years I'm looking in EA's direction as to which will be the more superior in hockey titles.  And that's an allegiance that isn't swayed easily.  Kudos to EA for putting out a great title.",EA finally made a believer out of me.,1221436800,12,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

But then I figured out all the controls, and once I figured out what I was doing, I loved it.
The main character who you play as is Solid Snake from the old Nintendo games: Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2.  (Metal Gear Solid and Metal Gear Solid 2 are not re-makes of them)
Solid Snake is a tough, ruthless guy who isn't afrid to take someone down.  Your arch-nemises is Liquid Snake along with his main henchmen: Revolver Ocelot, Sniper Wolf, Raven, and Psycho Mantis.
You can keep in touch with other characters who help you throughout the game on a ""codec"".  Two characters that are actually at your side during the game are Meyrl and Otocan.
Anyway, the plot is very detailed and there was obviously a lot of thought put into it.
The graphics aren't that great now, but at the time I bought it I thought they where pretty good.  But it was made a few years ago, so of course the graphics were not as good then.

The battery life is respectable, the unit is of passable build quality, and the reception range and signal reliability are impressive.  All this with a built-in touchpad.

You may ask why did I choose a PS3 keyboard for a PC?
- Bluetooth keyboards on PC's are rather expensive and more so when you are looking for a built-in touchpad.
- Few choices of products when searching for keyboard+touchpad combos
- Logitech makes the DiNovo Mini and Edge but these are rather expensive - and they have their issues.
- Wireless keyboard/mouse combos (non-Bluetooth) are notoriously short on reception range and unreliable (missed keystrokes)

The PS3 keyboard is fully functional with a PC and half the price of other alternatives (that are of unknown vendors and trash quality)

The highlights of the keyboard are:
- Value (contrasted to similar Bluetooth keyboard + touchpad sets)
- Bluetooth support (range, reliability)
- Touchpad (same as a laptop touchpad)
- Keyboard-based left and right mouse buttons on both sides of the keyboard (perfect for true ""laptop"" use)
- Touchpad-based scrolling
- Lightweight
- Acceptable build quality
- Acceptable battery life
- Software support is absolutely basic (No bloatware, Windows 7 does support this product)

The cons:
- Designed for a PS3 (No windows key but you can just use Ctrl+Esc)
- No backlighting (for use in low-light)
- Gloss plastic (fingerprints)
- Software support is absolutely basic (Might be an issue for some)
- Unknown if it can survive a drop to a hardwood floor (and I'm not going to test this out)
- Unit does not appear to shut off automatically
- Weak documentation (use standard Bluetooth procedures to install the unit)

Although i never got to beating this game (got bored after beating level 5), its still very fun to play. The only thing i hated about the game was not the challenge, but when you almost die and your life meter beeping like hell. This is my most favorite zelda game because its the only one where it really doesnt tell you where to go next. What i mean by this is after you beat a temple, someone or something doesnt say anything on the next location but don't worry, each temple you enter says what level it is so you know if your supposed to beat it or not *ex: i beat level 1 an 2 but then i find level 6. I turn back because i never beat level 4 an 5 to aquire the certain items in those temples in order to get past level 6*. There are also caves containing townsfolk where you buy valuable items, information, or free info and tasks. Now, thats just the underworld part, the overworld is a huge map with areas like forests, mountains and such with monsters, caves, temples (levels), and secrets all over the land and like i said, i like this zelda game the most because you always got to figure out where to go next which can take longer than you think if you don't use and guides or FAQS. And thats more than half of the game; wandering in circles, solving mysteries to get to the next location, searching for upgraded items such as swords or boomerangs, finding temples, caves, defeating bosses in temples with each boss having its own stragety where you need to figure out its weakness by using countless items on it.

**Sorta SPOILER** (sorta because it happens in like the first 10 minutes of the game and it's on the back of the box)

So, you are an author and someone else is writing your story for you and it starts to come true. I'm sure that sounds cliche. Like it has been played out many, many times before (in stories more, less in video games).

**END SPOILER**

But this game is far from cliche. It is unique and very intriguing. This game will pull you in instantly. It feels like you have been playing this game for a while, because you are just that into it right from the start.

I have yet to find a single flaw in this game. Not a single one. This is the second most beautiful game (graphics-wise) I have ever played and seen (Eternal Sonata is number one for me).

The controls are smooth and perfect, the weapons are fun and although there aren't very many of them it feels like there is a large selection (their strengths and weaknesses range greatly so there is nothing that extra weapons would add to this).

The maps are ridiculously large and free to explore entirely. The game heavily rewards people who explore every bit of the environment, too, because weapons and ammunition are in short supply and if you find a little chest that is hidden in some bushes, then you will be given a LOT of these items (weapons, ammunition, batteries (also very very important), and flash bangs).

There are side things to do, such as finding all of the thermoses or watching all of the televisions. They are tricky to find, but it is fun to see the creative places they are hidden.

The enemies say the FUNNIEST things. I laughed every single time one would sneak up on me. The first time I heard what one of them said, I was in a basement under some stairs, and one giant guy with an axe jumped at me (in slow-mo) from off the stairs, and he yelled dramatically ""omega-3 fatty acids are good for your heaaaaaart!!!"" Then they will also say ""fishing can be a hobby or a job!!"" So they basically just shout random facts, and personally it was really creative and made the game all the more special.

The environment is hard to maneuver sometimes because it is virtually always dark, but I feel like that was deliberate. It makes it creepy and more difficult.

I have never been more amused by characters in a game than the ones in here. They always had something funny to say. It lightened the mood of the game, as well, so that the darkness and depression of it isn't horribly overwhelming.

One thing that I had trouble with was using the weapons and ammunition. I would always try to save them because they were so hard to come across, and enemies sneak out of nowhere and swarm you. Do not follow in my footsteps, try to use them efficiently. Do not use them all at once, but every so often, you will lose everything you had and have to find more all over again. So what I recommend is playing the first part of the game multiple times until you see exactly how much ammunition and flash bangs you should use in one crowd of enemies. I died quite a few times because I was unable to figure out how to spread out the use of weapons.

The bosses were fun to fight and never repetitive. They ending was so thrilling (this ""ending"" I am referring to includes the location right before the final boss, too, because it was just so beautiful), and the story kept me playing it constantly. I spent all of my free time playing it.

5.0,True,"10 28, 2002",AT576Z9DC6HJ0,B00005V5LO,D. K. Malone,"I tried to like Jet Set Radio on Dreamcast. I loved the unique look, and the first few levels were tons o' fun. Then suddenly the challenge level (read: frustration level) spiked sharply and I got stuck in a certain place and gave up after trying to complete it 15 times or so. So, though I bought an Xbox several months ago, I had no intention of buying this, the sequel. If you read my other Xbox reviews, you'll see that the deciding factor that caused me to buy the console was a game called Panzer Dragoon Orta. At first I wasn't too hot on the idea, because the developer of the original Panzer Dragoon games, Team Andromeda, disbanded years ago. It was when I discovered that many former members of Team Andromeda work for the new developer, Smilebit, that I decided to get on board. Reading preview articles about PDO is how I found that Smilebit made some other games, including GunValkyrie, JSRF, and the original Jet Set Radio. The first thing I did was buy GunValkyrie. It was challenging as hell, but fun as hell to boot. I needed more Smilebit goodness, so I dug out my copy of Jet Set Radio and gave it another whirl. I started over from the beginning. I spent much more time in the tutorial than I did previously. Lo and behold, I made it through the entire game in a few nights. I loved it, and I had to have more. So I bought myself a copy of JSRF.

JSRF improves upon JSR in every conceivable way. Obviously, it's graphically superior, and JSR on the Dreamcast is still nothing to sneeze at even today. The levels are much bigger, teeming with activity and street life. They're much more insane in terms of seemingly out-of-reach areas which CAN be reached, if you can figure out how to trick your way there. The most important improvement is that the frustration factor has been drastically reduced. In JSR, every level had a time limit, and marauding packs of bloodthirsty, immortal, unstoppable cops and assassins that simply would NOT give up, they stayed on top of you the whole time. It was quite a common occurence for me to run out of time or have the life beaten out of me before I could complete the level and have to start over. In JSRF, these things have been eliminated. No time limit. No roving enemies. There are a few points in the game when you have to deal with enemies, but once you've dispatched them, they're gone. To make up for the drop in frustration-challenge, they beefed up the level of skill-challenge. There are tag points in JSRF that take MUCH more effort to reach than anything in JSR. But since you have nothing keeping you from trying over and over until you finally get it, it's simply a much more fun experience. This is the sort of game that's fun the first time you play it, then when you finish it you immediately start over from the beginning to see what can do with the finely honed skills of a seasoned veteran.

It's such a shame Smilebit's games are languishing down in ""low sales"" territory. They are true bastions of gameplay and challenge and they deserve attention. You don't play them for story or character development. You play them to PLAY them. My anticipation for Panzer Dragoon Orta is higher than ever.",I am now Smilebit's slave,1035763200,7,,

The only thing that can be considered as terrific in this game is that you can't shoot when you are moving, I'm the kind of guy that step back when shooting and it's frustrating when I can't do it because in some missions there are some monsters that can one-hit kill you and you've to kill the monster quickly before it eats you.

Another thing to say, this game is easy. When you know where the traps are, when you know where the hard enemies appears then this game turns boring.

But still I would highly recommend it to my friends.

I will list all of the pros and cons. firstly there is a factory defect on some of the hard copy cd's that you buy, on disc one. what this means is it will instal to about 15% then stop saying there is a data loop and won't instal any further. a few people that ive talked to said they had the same bug. its not on every single copy of tera just a few here and there so be aware of this. i had to down load the game from the tera web site then use the key that came with the game i bought.

with that aside here is my review.
PRO'S
1. the game is very very stable, i have seen virtually no bugs or errors so far with the game itself.
2. the game is extreamly large, out of all the mmos i have played it has the most land mass i have seen, so much so that they have 280 speed mounts, and the flight paths use teleporters to get you to point B faster.
3. its beutiful X 100000000000 i have never seen such beuty put into a game.
4. the monsters have a great AI they respond well to the players actions.
5. the best feature, the game requires skill, there is no tab targeting in this game and it playes like a 3rd person shoter.

Cons.
1. see the issue stated above, down loading the game using the stream down loader is the best way to get the game however.
2. you cant use the mouse to click skills on the task bar you have to macro everything. this is a bonus to those who have key pads or like to hunt and peck on a keyboard but there is a learning curve to get by.

All in all the game is really fun to play and if you buy the game from amazon / where ever and use the key that comes with it even if you are F2P you get the founder benifits. this game is a must for those that want to play a game with great graphix and skill needed. i highly recomend it.",Awesome MMO,1365552000,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

First, the graphics have been enhanced greatly. You begin by making your family, including all ages. You can tweak every aspect of your sim's appearance, from hairstyles to tattoos to a huge range of clothing. You can have your sims in love with each other, married, have kids and more.

The Sim world is no longer four-angled - you can do full rotation around in circles. The graphics are extremely impressive. The starting selection of items and decorations is extensive, but you know that in short order there will be millions of add-ons coming down the road :) So this is only the beginning.

I am THRILLED to find that they finally give you days off from work, and even let you earn vacation days, so that you can rest and relax in between your hard working day hours. The entire pace is much more balanced than the original game - you feel like you have plenty of time to enjoy your house and throw parties, as well as putting in the required hours at work.

Your computer in the game is far more useful now, letting you chat with friends, send email, order groceries, and even play SSX.

For hard core sims fans, the real glory comes in the fact that your characters actually go through a life cycle. They age (very slowly) and as they have kids, you watch the kids grow up and age, too. The kids even have the traits of the parents! So you can literally go through generations of sims, raising each one up.

In addition, each sim has one of five ""lifestyle goals"". Maybe your sim is after knowledge - or maybe they want the happy family life. Your sim could covet money or romantic encounters. Whatever it is that makes your sim happy, by hitting goals in that area the sim earns bonus points. So those sims who aren't happy with the 'career track' can still achieve kudos by working towards other aims.

Highly highly recommended for any Sims fan. It's just as good as the original Sims in playability - and far improved in many ways!

One minor thing I noticed is that it had slightly improved visually over last year's edition.

I believe one thing they have improved in substantially is the visual effects. The faces, in my opinion, have been enhanced to fit NFL counterparts better, as well as jersey and arm muscles have been modified to look more realistic. I also noticed a little improvement on the stadium and player shadow to add more clarity and visual. Moreover, I like how the field has more fuller precipitation, footprints in the snow, and better looking field grass than Madden NFL 08.

As a Madden NFL fan, I believe there are not much difference from Madden 09 to Madden 08. I still think Madden 09 needs to improve more on the animations and better camera presentation.

For my gaming purposes on Steam, it is extremely easy to use (plug-and-play works with Steam Big Picture Mode right out of the box, no software required). It will really give you the console experience.

All the buttons are responsive and high quality (typical Logitech build, durable). I had no problems with the triggers being too stiff as other reviews have mentioned; this may only affect a few models. It has the excellent ergonomics of a Playstation controller and the better-feeling buttons of the Xbox controller, so this is the perfect child of the two.

The color is a bit darker in person (more of a darker navy blue opposed to the light navy blue in the picture, can look almost black in low-light) and I think this is a good thing. It blends in far better with black-themed computer systems, and it makes the controller look a lot less cheap.

Overall  I must say this controller works very well in gaming, no input lag and the in-game movements are precise as if you are actually playing on an Xbox/Playstation.

No problems with:
Fallout New Vegas
Skyrim
Rocket League
Borderlands 2
Left 4 Dead
Dirt Showdown

You will have virtually no problem with this playing any FPS/racing games/console titles. I cannot speak for RPG's but I figure there would be no problem as it would format the way an RPG formats to an Xbox/PS.

Overall great product for the price/value. If this ever breaks (doubt it will for the life of my computer and gaming needs) I will definitely buy this same controller again. This controller does not lack any features of a basic controller, and I personally see no reason to spend more money than the price of this controller for a higher end unit unless you're hardcore/professional and need more advanced functionality.

I played this game a lot when it was released on sega, even bought the joystick controller to more simulate the arcade.
I have a little story about this, kinda bad but Im gonna share it anyways.

I was in Tokyo, Japan a few years back and I found the Sega building, its like 5 or 6 floors of arcades.
I stepped inside and was blown away, games aging back to the 80's till now, so you really got see a lot of the advancement made
as the games are played side by side.
One one floor its all about this robots game, where you are Robot and you fight... other robots and it looked great.
So i jumped on a stack and started trying to learn my way through all the moves this little kid rolls over and drops his token in and smashes me,
and he has this evil mischievous face on.  I smile at him... the best I can, so I move over one, he knows what hes doing, I'm a noob so I'm trying to learn
so I kinda wanta get the moves down before challenging players... NOT gonna happen, he had WAY to much fun last round I guess and did it again.
Ok... now the F'er is following me, so I walk over to the very dated Street Fight 2, and start playing, he comes and watches for a second, then KERPLUNK,
IN GOES THE TOKEN.  You think I would be mad, but it was very satisfying pulling multiple perfects in a row off on this kid.  I smiled big and looked down and gave him the
customary ""WHAT NOW BITCH"" look, he looked sad and walked away.

I don't play multiplayer, never have.  When I get a game like this, I am looking for an engaging story, with great, cinematic action.  I played the original Modern Warfare, and loved every minute of it.  Aside from some slight confusion about the plot (explained below), I found everything I was looking for in MW2.

The action is nonstop in MW2 as in its predecessor.  Several of the scenes in the game literally had me forgetting to breathe.  It's just a game, sure, but it keeps the adrenaline flowing with lots of guns, ammo, etc.

The story is what sets this game apart.  There are spoilers, so don't read this paragraph if you don't want to see them.  To begin, you have little to no attachment to the characters.  You might recognize Soap McTavish, though he didn't do much speaking in the first game.  However, you really start to get that connection with the characters hen Captain Price re-enters the game.  You'll remember him, as he was Soap's mentor and CO in the first game.  As the odds get more and more stacked against the main characters, though, you really start to feel for them.  The entire world is eventually against them as they seek revenge for a betrayal.  I won't spoil any more, but it really, really got to me.  I enjoyed the story immensely, and am looking forward to playing through it again until I can get a hold of MW3.

The gameplay really adds to the cinematic action, too. And the closing scene....well, remember the first one?  This one is possibly better.  Completely awesome.  If you like single player, and play the MW games for that aspect, get this game.  You'll love it.  I can't speak to the multiplayer, as it's not interesting to me in the least.  I, for one, enjoyed it, and will continue to play the MW games for what I enjoy in them.",I don't play multiplayer. Single player campaign is top-notch!,1325376000,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I still love the timeless classics of pac-man, combat, q-bert, asteroids, space invaders, pitfall(my top fave),and some the other more obscure titles like fanthom,fire fighter, mountain king  solar fox, taz etc. I have loved video games ever since even at my age of 36 and being a girl one wouldn't think I'd still love this stuff but I do and without the atari and having a interest in electronics thanks to it I never would of built my own pc and learned how nor wanted to.

5.0,False,"10 15, 2013",A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B00EZPCX1A,Tsanche,"For those who have followed Nintendo Handhelds, the very idea that they'd release so many different versions of one handheld is nothing new.  The original Gameboy eventually had the Gameboy Pocket and then Gameboy Color.  The Gameboy Advance had the SP and the Micro.  The DS had the original release, the lite, the DSi and the DSi XL.  The 3DS already has the original and the XL.  It seemed strange that so soon after the launch of the 3DS XL we'd find ourselves with another DS release.  This is the 2DS.  On the outside it doesn't seem like much, but once you get it in your hand it's actually pretty solid.

As a note before beginning: The following review assumes you are quite familiar with the 3DS already.  In reading this I am assuming you are familiar with the 3DS interface and features.  They will not be detailed here.  Just know that they all work exactly the same here.

There are only two major differences between a 2DS and 3DS.  The first is that there is no stereoscopic 3D.  This means those hoping to play their games in stereoscopic 3D won't be able to do it.  For someone like me who insists on playing his original 3DS with the 3D slider turned off anyway, this is no problem.  It doesn't bother me in the slightest.  The second major difference is that the screen doesn't close like other DS models.  Other DS models had a clamshell design that allowed you to fold the screen down.  Both screen are visible at all times.  If you plan on getting this for a child I would strongly suggest buying screen protectors.

Aside from those two things, the 2DS pretty much does everything your 3DS does.  All the channels are still there.  You can still access the Nintendo eShop.  There's nothing really ""stripped"" away here.  There is still a place for your SD card on the side.  All games are inserted into a slot that's on the top of the 3DS.  The camera still works just fine.  The interface is still fine.  The stylus is located in a slot on the back about halfway down the right hand side.  Anything you could do on your other 3DS systems you can do here.  It also retains being able to play your original DS games, although it doesn't look like there's a chance of it playing GBA games for those who are wondering.

For those curious about the size of the 2DS, it's relatively small.  The screen sizes are that of the original 3DS and not of the XL.  So you won't have to worry that it's ""too big"" for the little ones.  Although the DS itself might be a tad small if you've got big hands.  Other differences include the fact that the L and R buttons are a lot bigger and easier to press.  The button placement itself actually works.  The face buttons (A, B, X, and Y) and circle pad are located next to the top screen while the directional pad is located closer to the bottom screen.  The start and select button are also located near the bottom screen off to the side just below the face buttons.  They're all very easy to get to and because it's not too big it's perfect placement.  Also, and I must say this is especially nice, there is a switch that allows you to put the 2DS into sleep mode.  Since you can't fold the top screen down they built in this little switch to compensate for that.  Just a flick and your 2DS goes to sleep.  A flick back and it wakes up.  Perfect if you need to put it away for any reason.

There are only a couple of gripes with the 2DS.  None of them large.  The first is that I think I'd have preferred a clam shell design.  The 2DS is quite a remarkable device.  Yet a fold down top screen would've still been nice to have.  That way you could easily stick it in your pocket and not have to worry too much about scratches on the screen.  Both screens could've been protected this way.  This is pretty minor, but something that would've been nice, nonetheless. The other thing is that if you are getting this to replace a 3DS or 3DSXL some accessories don't work.  Those who got a Circle Pad Pro, for instance, won't be able to use it here, for instance.  I'm sure there will be brand new accessories to go with it, but at this point it feels odd that Nintendo isn't simply making a model with a second circle pad always there.  Likewise, if you're actually getting this to replace your 3DS, Nintendo has made it very tedious to transfer your data.  As you must perform a system transfer.  So if, for any reason you plan on trading in your old 3DS for a 2DS for any reason, keep in mind that you need to do a system transfer before handing it off.  You can't simply pull out your SD Card and put it in another system.

This, of course, brings about the question always asked when a new model of a system comes out.  Is it worth it?  The answer varies from console to console.  But here I'll say simply that the 2DS is definitely a cheap alternative to the 3DS if you don't have one.  The price isn't bad.  This is especially nice if you have a young child.  If you've already got a 3DS there's no particular reason to get a 2DS.  It does all the same things.  The only reason to really replace a 3DS with this one is if you really like the design (or if you're looking for a cheap alternative should your need to be replaced).  Nevertheless it's not bad by any means.  As a cheap alternative it's perfect.",Much Better Than Expected.,1381795200,66,,

5.0,False,"01 30, 2014",A1U6XPYATU9OPG,B00GZ1GUNO,Gabe,"I've never spent much time playing the ""Tomb Raider"" series, but this reboot did all the right things, and it drew me right in. This modern take on the famous franchise takes inspiration from many great sources- my first impression, oddly enough, was of ""Resident Evil 4"" (a classic so significant, it's still influencing the gaming landscape). The early goings of ""Tomb Raider"" have a distinctly ""survival horror"" vibe that is masterfully conveyed, interspersed with just the right amounts of Quick Time Events, cinematic showpieces, character development, story telling, and gameplay tutorials. Additionally, it reminded me of the fantastic island of the TV show, ""Lost"" (complete with freaky natives and bunkers!).

The most striking comparison, of course, is that of the ""Uncharted"" series. ""Tomb Raider"" obviously existed long before ""Uncharted"", but it's equally obvious that it drew inspiration from the mechanics of climbing, combat, and cinematic storytelling of one of this generation's most successful series. And I'm not complaining at all- I wish there were more games like ""Uncharted""! For the most part, ""Tomb Raider"" does a fantastic job implementing these elements, resulting in a game that is a blast to play and easy to pick up. Everything is very responsive, the settings are visually vibrant and interesting, and the island is begging for more thorough searching. The inclusion of TONS of unlockables is a genius notion, including documents (which help to further unfurl the mystery of the island), artifacts, and salvage (for weapon and gear upgrades), and it means crazy amounts of replay value... plus the online multiplayer aspect, if that strikes your fancy.

The only thing holding ""Tomb Raider"" back is that when pitted up against the unrivaled production values of ""Uncharted"", it falls a shade short. The characters are noticeably lacking compared to the likes of Nathan, Sully, and Elena, and the presentation just seems a bit ""off"". There's such an emphasis placed on (literal and figurative) darkness and grittiness, I oftentimes had difficulty seeing what was going on around my character, and it actually had something of a demoralizing effect (particlarly when compared to the bright, tropical locales of ""Uncharted""). That's not to say that ""Tomb Raider"" is a bad game- it's not. In reality, it's a very good game- it's just not among my top favorites.

Final note (MINOR spoilers follow): The producers of this game must be huge fans of the movie ""The Descent"", for there are many nods to the horror film, including Lara's affinity for the climbing axe, the ""bone scramble"" toward daylight in the opening moments, and the slow emergence from the red pool of ichor in ""the pit"". Additionally, Lara's psychological transformation closely mirrors that of ""The Descent""'s protagonist. It was an excellent source to draw inspiration from, and the developers of ""Tomb Raider"" did a fine job of subtly paying homage to it.",An awesome game for fans of Uncharted and The Descent (the horror movie),1391040000,15,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The story line is excellently written with characters who are neither good or evil but human beings whose actions dictate of what they believe to be right. The graphics are superb with lush realistic environments that look like they would in Life After People, amazing lighting effects and atmosphere that perfectly invoke certain moods and emotions from the player, and whose overall game length well surpassed how long I thought it was going to be; for I repeatedly told myself ""I must be nearing the end"" throughout several sections of the game only to then put in another several hours.
The only gripe I had with the game was your walk/run speed you have when your just traveling and not in combat, as looking for supplies and parts in larger open areas can take forever to search through and the ally AI when sneaking around will just make you laugh, for example Ellie has a knack for walking right in front of an enemy about 2-4 feet away and never be seen yet when you peak your head out for less than a second about 20 feet away they see you instantly, making me go ""why am I even here, if she's such a ninja?""

Everything about this game is great. Even if you are not into boxing this game is great. The controls are unbelievable and Nintendo made the game so you can use the Wii remote and the nun chuck to work as you throw real life punches or you can choose old school mode - were you can use the Wii remote the same way you used to use the old school Nintendo remote when you played Mike Tysons Punch Out. This game is more fun then I can put into words. It has everything and then some. Nintendo hit a grand slam with this game. If you liked Punch Out in the Arcade and Mike Tyson's punch out - this game beats them both and then some. The controls are super accurate and you could actually get a work out from this game.

You're doubtless quite familiar with the Sims as a premise. Basically you create and control people. You run every aspect of their lives. You make them do their bidding, and if that means building a house full of nothing but wooden furniture and fireplaces, then by gum, you can do that!

""Sims 2"" is a massive improvement over the original game. It took everything that was good about the original and basically set it to eleven, while toning down a lot that wasn't so great (you don't have to micromanage your Sims nearly as much). With this game you get a whole new set of bells and whistles, including a 3D enviroment, Sims that actually age and will eventually die of old age (provided you aren't the sort who tells them to go swimming and then deletes the ladder so they can't leave the pool. Mwa-ha-ha-ha!), new jobs, new aspirations, new gizmos, new building options, etc, etc!

It can be kind of overwhelming at first, but if you start out small the game will guide you, and you'll soon be running people's lives just like that one aunt you have who thinks she knows exactly how everyone should do things and loves to tell you, at length, about how you're messing up your life!

This pack includes the original game, the ""Nightlife"" expansion pack, which adds dating, a new area for the Sims to visit and vampires! You also get the ""Celebration Stuff"" pack, which gives you a lot more new stuff to use to decorate your Sims homes for the holidays!

5.0,False,"04 27, 2010",A1KKE6VX8VPWZK,B001URRH0S,Joe Marino,"I had not played the first Dead to Rights, so this is my review of this game as it stands by itself and not the franchise as a whole. This is a review of the game from the playability aspect and not of the story. You can safely read my whole review and not have the story ruined at all. As I write this I have played it a couple of hours and will update this after I finish the whole game.

Overview:
You play as vice cop Jack Slate. Your job is to clean up Grant City. This game is mostly its a shooter with a different twist where your pet is a vicious fighting machine.

Game mechanics:(+)
If you ever played World Of Warcraft and played a hunter class you will be familiar with playing through your pet, (Shadow). This game takes that mechanic and builds on it by allowing you to control your pet with more ""nuance"", the end result is that its not just about going in guns blazing. Instead you must anticipate how Shadow will respond to the environment and also the threats. Its a pretty cool mix of the ideas of combat. Of course as Jack you can do your own special moves .

Shadow's forms: (+)
The cool thing is as Shadow you can play three different modes; one being a rogue like class where Shadow actually hunkers down and walks like a ninja dog, you know, if ninja dogs existed that is. Another one of his forms is a neutral fighter mode which is like a standard fighter class. The last form is the berserker form which is like all other berserker archetypal character. You do much more damage but are significantly weaker as far as armor.

Graphics: (+)
On the PS3 this looks fantastic. The textures are really sharp and detailed. At times there are alot of shadows and it can be difficult to see certain areas, but thats where Shadow comes in. Jack is kinda clunky appearing at times, but overall the look and appearance of the game as a whole is really crisp.

Lighting: (+)
The shadows look great! Usually in PS3 games there are jaggy shadows. In this I see them but not nearly as bad as say AC2. All in all they are crisp and flow over the objects in the game very well.

Motion Capture: (+)
The motion capture in this game is REALLY smooth. Especially with regards to Shadow, the dog animation looks very lifelike. During the fight sequences there are times Jack looks a bit like a puppet, but overall the motion is smooth.

Fighting (+/-)
'Hand to hand: (+)
The hand to hand fighting in this is spot on and a real fun part of the game. At times the moves are easy to execute because the built in character AI anticipates the moves you are trying to do, just enough to not be annoying.

Shooting: (-)
I didn't like the shooting in this game. It at times seemed off and a bit difficult to aim. I am not sure if it was the lack of aim assist or too much of it. Either way it was kind of hard to shoot at times.

Shadow: (+)
He tears this game up. I almost think that I would enjoy playing solely as Shadow for the whole game and just assume he could talk to people. It really is fun playing him as a pet and also as his own character. Very cool moves and vicious attacks.

Environments: (-)
The environments are standard post-apocalyptic fare. The mobs you are fighting are eh... ok. The ai is fine but the weird thing is the story has some glaring holes in it. I won't cover them here as to keep the no spoilers aspect of my reviews correct. Suffice to say you may be wondering what or where things are coming from, from time to time.

Replayability: (-)
I have not finished this yet but I do not see me being all that interested in replaying this just for trophies like I would for Assassins Creed II or Uncharted 1/2. It looks like I may play it one more time but after that I wouldn't be interested in playing it again.

Summary: (+)
This game sofar has been a blast to play and I look forward to finishing it. While its not perfect, it does offer some great story telling and the animations for Shadow are fantastic. It looks like they used motion capture for his animation. Jack is fun to play and its overall a really enjoyable game to play. I may change my story once I finish it.

Well, by played, I mean she kicked ass and I flailed around like I had something wrong with me. Regardless, it was a fun time. My biggest complaint was that we had to take turns during the multiplayer and it would really screw me up if I was actually getting into the groove of a song (if that makes sense).

Thankfully, Dance Central 2 solves that niggling problem for me. The character models/graphics/gameplay are all roughly the same, just some very slight improvements. The menu system is a little more intuitive which is a really nice touch as well. Another plus is that you don't have to buy the same songs over again, for a small fee you can simply import all of the previous DLC you bought (for a small fee, of course).

If you don't have the original Dance Central or you love to play the multiplayer, I'd say to absolutely pick this up. If you're having fun with the original and are pretty good at it, I don't think it's really worth the incremental upgrade at full price. Harmonix is notorious for incremental upgrades to their games (Rock Band, Guitar Hero), so, that's something to keep in mind when you're weighing this decision.

Also, for those achievement hunters out there, be sure you can shake it before you buy this, I've really had to come to terms with not 1king this and the original :p",If you don't have the first OR you love multiplayer = Absolutely Worth It,1320624000,,,
5.0,False,"12 16, 2001",A37G6UPLDGH81P,B00001OWYW,Ookami,"when I was a wee lad, I played board games, collect four, hungry hippo, monopoly.  They were fun diversions, I was later amazed by the prospect of playing game like pac man, dig dug, ect in arcades, (yah I know I'm old).  I remember the simple days... and It makes my mind wobble how complex, and utterly craptastic, videogames have become today... I've been a gamer pretty much all my life.  So I know how sometimes It's best too keep a game simple, and fun rather then just ruin it by making it too complex.
Castlevania manages too find a perfect balance between the simple and complex.  It mixes the old run, jump, smack a monster medusa head, gameplay with street fighter like spells, and wait until you see some of these bosses... some are admittedly lame, others will put your gaming skills too the test. But It's best feature is the awesome design of the castle... and how the developers placed the power ups.
Super metroid has been called one of the... if not THE... most well designed game of all time.  The bosses were big and frightening.  the map was desgined with the powerups placed in just such a way that when you found one powerup... It gave you the ability too enter an previously unreachable area, There's a certain rewarding thrill behind playing a game with this design, and the developers are either fans of that design, are worked on super metroid themselves.  Cuz It not only follows that formula, but builds upon it in every way.
when you first start the game... there will be all sorts of paths for you too follow... but apparently the archtect of castlevania is a sick joker, cuz even with your supernatural powers, you just can't seem too reach these paths.  But alter in the game... after alot of adventuring, fighting, and finding all sorts of goodies, you will either find what you need too reach that unreachable platform, or wind up on the other side of it through you journeys.  and rest assured it's a fun trip.
The powerups are all cool and fun too use, my fave is the mist spell.  that lets your charachter turn into a fog.  your enemies can't touch you when your transformed, so you can just pass through them, and attack thier backs.  others, like changing into a bat, wolf, or being able too super jump, or wear armor that breaks spikes, are all fun too use that has too be played too truly understand.
And as for the story... Well, It won't win a oscar, but It's pretty cool.  The last belmont kicks the stuffing outta drac in the beginning of the game, then after four years of friday night poker games, and having a wench in every town... he disappears.  And wouldn't ya know it... about the same time, that fun haunted house that we all know and love as castlevania reappears out of the mist.  Richters sis, maria, puts 2 and 2 together; goes too find him.  (Apparently he owes her money or something :P.)  The half human son of dracula, whos supposed too be locked in an eternal sleep, wakes up after 400 years.  after going too the nearest tailor too get some hip clothes and a much needed bath, he heads out for castlevania as well.  Sword in hand and ready too kick booty... of course that's just the opening... the rest of the story is pretty decent.  I liked how death and allucard had somewhat of a repore.  death seemed at first reluctant too fight him, even gave him a chance too go back... but when allucard refuses too renounce his quest of patricide... the whuppin begins.  moments like these, and many others like It give some more depth too the world of castlevania.
I could go on and on... this is a game that has a simple premise... but manages too weave in so many complex elements, all fun, yet never loses the simplicity.  Games were meant too be simple.  a fun distraction from the hectic pace of life. The video gaming industry has grown into such a massive beast over the past few years.  It's no longer a niche hobby.  and such there is a high financial demand for innovation.  But sometimes innovation comes at the cost of fun.  Castlevania SOTN manages too retain the simplicity of the old days.... while having innovations up the kazoo.  That's why so many people have scuh strong feelings for it today.  I would reccommend this too anyone that likes videogames, or wants too start playing them.  Solid snake is cool and all, but Allucard Just has more style.  if they ever making a fighting game centred around the coolest video game charachter ever... expect too see these two in the finals.
Of course thats just my opinon.  I could be wrong.  :P","A true masterpiece, one of the best videogames ever.",1008460800,2,{'Format:': ' CD-ROM'},

5.0,True,"02 10, 2015",AR1NP84PU84D4,B00JJNQG98,Steven M.,"I was a longtime user of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sony-MDR-XD100-Stereo-Headphones/dp/B0007N55NM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sony MDR-XD100 Stereo Headphones</a>, when they finally started falling apart. As I only use these headsets to play on my computer, I figured I'd look for a gaming headset instead of just headphones. I have never been happier!

I am not so nave to think that these are the best headsets ever designed, but for the money I spent on them, I am fairly certain they are the best headsets my money can buy.

First, these phones sound leagues better than the Sony headphones I was using. I can hear things in games that I never knew existed. Second, they are as comfortable as many of these reviews state. I immediately replaced the leather covers with the cloth ones (per many of the reviews) and enjoyed the feel immediately. They are comfortable, do not cause ""head crush syndrome"" like some headsets do, the band is properly padded to avoid pain up to, and the weight is light enough that I can wear them for extended periods of time without discomfort.

As for the product itself - well done Kingston! The package comes with a carrying bag, a cord extender, an in-line volume/mute control, and a detachable microphone (not to mention the extra ear cups already discussed above). Perfect! The overall quality of the item is also superb. I almost feel as if I ""stole"" these at the price I got them for - as the quality is far above what I'm used to for this price point. Good on Kingston for introducing quality headsets at such an affordable price. Lure us in to the world of ""great"" headsets and eventually down the road we will buy even better and better product. Smart business practices at their finest.

The only complaint (and it is minor for me) is the microphone is a bit ""weak"" at times. I could be my system, but overall I seldom use the mic, so I'm not complaining and certainly didn't ding them a star for it. If you are a heavy online talker, then recommend you test the mic immediately and see if it fits your needs. It doesn't sound bad (according to those that listen to me), just not as ""powerful"" as some of their dedicated microphones. Also, as noted in other reviews - make sure the mic is facing the right direction or you will really sound like you are far away/under water.

Overall, I couldn't be happier with this headset. The package is well constructed, comes with ample ""extras"" and has a very affordable price for what you're getting. Are there headsets that sound even better? Probably! Would I notice the difference? Maybe, but for the price - I'm happy for now.

5.0,False,"02 15, 2014",ASPLNAID2UYCQ,B00946FSIA,Tinye,"For reference: Fully played XIII 40+hrs loved it - Briefly played XIII-2 4hrs was not enjoyable to me.

I love Lightning, I love her character, I love her outfits, I love her English dub. I love everything about Lightning, which is why this game was 'made' for me. This game is for two types of people. 1: People who love Lightning  and 2: those who want to see the end of the XIII story. If you're not one of those people, you won't like this game.

Story: 10 hours in so far and I'm enjoying everything that I've been told. I really love the side quests and there are a good amount of them. After every sidequest there is a conclusion that makes me feel like I changed someone and helped their life.

World: I think a pro for some people is that you can traverse pretty much anywhere, jump, climb, run, attack, it's great and very free. You can also choose which main quest you want to do so therefore the game isn't 'linear' - it tells a story but you can choose which one you want to do and if you want to stop on one quest and go to another you can.

Graphics: Extremely fluid and done very well. The environment and characters are great for ps3 but damn I wish this was on ps4 because it would look how it is meant to look. It has some choppy frames here and there and some shadowing sometimes bothers me on the hair but overall well done. During combat everything is crisp and clean, no slowdown there and it is just beautiful.

Combat/Gameplay: So far everything seems very polished especially the animations during combat and the overworld. This combat system is at the absolute pinnacle of the ATB system. I think it is amazing, although it semi ditches turn based commands it's still there in essence but it has evolved into a more action based fight system. You have 3 ATB, kinda like having 3 party members into 1 person. You switch between each Schemata, or stance, and choose between 4 commands. This combat system has A LOT of depth and A LOT of strategy. This is by far one of the more difficult combat mechanics I have come in contact with and I have loved every minute of it.
Customizing Lightning's outfits (Schemata) is super fun and done very fluidly. I'm sure I spend about 10% of my time messing with all my Schematas or equipment. You don't have to spend that much time but I just love the personal Lightning customization it has. I think if the game had nothing else going for it, Lightning, her customization, and combat systems would carry her through easily. I can't rave about it enough, Square-Enix really did some creative innovation when it comes to Lightning Returns and it shows and paid off.

The other benefit this game has is its re-playability. New game + mode offers increase loot game, difficulty choice, and replay value. The great thing is you don't have to do everything the same, you can go where ever you want and skip things you didn't like or take the most efficient route possible. You can customize Lightning to be a massive powerhouse and still have it be difficult and I think that is a great addition to an RPG especially with a more action orientated combat system.

In regards to the doomsday clock, it really is not bad at all. It works with the game and you can stop the clock quite often prolonging the day almost forever if you keep battling monster. If the clock turns you off it's very forgiving, it may feel like constant pressure but it grows on you and you get used to it. You want to explore a bit, stop time, fight some battle while you explore and bam no loss in time.

This game is difficult for an RPG and you can't just grind your way to easy, you have to be competent and learn the battle system, that is its biggest star, second being Lightning herself.

Conclusion: This game deserves more eyes because it truly is innovative in a great way. Even if the story doesn't interest you the combat system will and I think it could carry the game. Don't look for traditional mechanics in Lightning Returns but embrace what the developers were trying to provide: A fun, well thought strategy aRPG with a big presence.

UPDATE 2/28/14
Just finished the game for a total of 68 hours to complete everything I could have done through the first playthrough. I think that's good play time! There is a lot more to do and more challenge with New Game+ Hard.

Also I really want to point out how forgiving the in-game clock is. By the time I hit day 6~ out of 14, I had completed all main quests and almost all side quests. I had SOOO MUCH leftover time that I stopped using Chronostasis and for the last few days I slept in the inn for 12+ hrs because I had completed everything I could for those days. I didn't need the time.

The clock makes the game a living world, without it the game would be less. It is a positive and the more you play through it the more you'll start to agree. You should feel no pressure because of how forgiving it is. If that deters you from playing this game I would think again because this world is beautiful and the gameplay is top notch. The ending was EXTREMELY satisfying and the end-game cinematics were freakin awesome.

By the time I finish playing this game with all the new-game+ stuff I'm sure I'll have 100+ hours at the end. Worth it imo. :D",The best of the XIII series,1392422400,11,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

It's sad. You think I would know Vince from IGN because I was right - I don't and had no prior knowledge of his review. He gave the game a 6.7. Because he didn't like the open world elements and not enough Darkzone. Like any bad fan fiction where author - think the story they have told is just awesome because it's what they wanted. When the real material doesn't match they believe the real thing is bad.

Update* 3/16/16 IF we get even get a IGN review. It has been 7 days and still nothing. Where as Gamespot and Polygon have given this game a 8 and 7 respectfully - I don't really agree with those scores but they are fair reviews. There are people with full time jobs. Who have made it to level 30. I myself only write reviews for fun but I also work on a novel and I managed one. This is Vince's job, he gets paid to review this game and can't even manage it.
Unprofessional and classless. I don't care how busy you are - you get paid to review the game. He is still stuck around level 24.
But I stand by my original claim the review will be horrible I wouldn't be surprised if it gets a 5-6 for all the idiotic fanboy reasons I always claimed. I have a feeling this will be one of these games reviewers are mixed about and many gamers love or like.

Update* 3/12/16. Be prepared for a horrible IGN review. The guy reviewing this game thinks the game should have been the Darkzone only. He gets extremely bored with the PVE aspect of this game which I consider the best part. He sounds like a Call of Duty player or typical online shooter fan hating this game for not being exactly like those.
Also he is talking crap on the game for not being an MMO. This is not a MMO. It doesn't claim to be one. It is a single player game, with multiplayer options in PVP and it has multiplayer safehouse hubs. I can't believe this guy gets paid a living wage being a reviewer. I have read better reviews here, and forums - where people do it for free.
He also gave Evolve a 9 - a game many consider average at best. I expect more from a professional reviewer. Yes he is welcome to his opinion but he isn't accepting this game for what it is. That would be like saying, ""Hmmm this apple isn't that good. It doesn't taste like chocolate cake at all.""
Here is what many who are not paid critics don't seem to understand. As a Critic it doesn't matter what you want a game to be, nor does it matter what you like. Say you hate Superhero movies. Too bad, you go there and judge the movie based on what it offers, and the demographic who like that type of movie. You must look outside your own tastes for a fair review. IGN won't be doing that here. I have no idea what the score is but I just know it will be a 7 or even worse. All because they want a multiplayer gank fest PVP only game.
Here is the deal. If you want the Darkzone to be the only element of this game? Then stay there and just do that! Why hate on a game for offering things beyond a trolling gank wonderland?

My Original Review
Military shooters are a dying interest for me. You could say shooters are too. If they aren't mixed with another genre - like RPG. Because the reality is, at best you are looking at a short campaign and a series of hamster wheels offered for multiplayer (in various map sizes).
I am glad people enjoy ""just shooters"" as I call them. I enjoyed them for a time as well. My problem isn't with you. My problem is big publishers offer very little on the market for a player like me (Battlefront, Call of Duty, Battlefield - well after 2, ect). Destiny tired to offer such a RPG but the reality is I am a PC gamer first. Destiny would have added a lot to the RPG online shooter genre if handled right. But with all the lore cut out (at the last minute) it was a grindfest shell.
Watch it will be a 6.8 score and they will say, ""Not all Darkzone. Not people running around PvE.""
If you want to pick apart any game? Make it fair, pick apart bugs, pacing, story, graphics, soundtrack, mechanics, and character creation options. Try to be objective beyond, ""I don't like the game it is CRAPZ!!!!""

Sure there are RPG shooters (Mass Effect 2 is my best game of all time). But what about just a military shooter set in our current time and a believable story? Where multiplayer is certainly an option, Co Op too, with multiplayer hubs, all the things that make it a great change of pace. But is merely an offering to the PVE. We have been crap out of luck until now. That is what The Division offers.
Much of the critizing launched at this game were by people who don't really understand what this game is not because they are stupid. Because they are used to the typical shooter offerings on the market (I do exaggerate their opinions to show how unfounded they are).
I would like to go over some of the more dramatic type of issues of complaints. The top three.
""DERE IS 2 MUCH RUNNNIN AROUND GUIZ! I jusss wanna shoott otha playas or stufff ta shoooot.""
This one is probably the second most common issue I have read everywhere. The reality is there were a lot of enemy NPCs for the beta. For testing issues. Not to mention so much pve was sealed off. Not to mention PVP is in the Darkzone
""OMG PEEEPPOL TROLLL IS DA DARKKSONE! DEY JUMPP IN FRONNT OF MEE WHIN KILLIN DA STUFFS! PEOPPLE RAOM IN PACKS AND IT IS SOO UNFAIIRRR! NEEDSSS AUTOAIMMM!""
Are you trying to tell me online shooters have trolls? I never would have guessed that! Look the Darkzone is supposed to be unfair and an unforgiving place. If that is too much for you? Do not go there. The fact anyone can betray you, anything can happen, and it is without rules makes it interesting and fun. Make friends and bring them with you.
""I WASSS JUST SO BORED HORRIBULLL GAME LOLZ""
The type of shooter The Division is comes down to taste. This isn't call of duty, this isn't battlefield. Those games are great for you. But just because The Division isn't doesn't make it bad it just isn't for you. I think Game of Thrones, and The Walking Dead is so boring I want to cry. But millions of people love those shows and my opinion doesn't make it bad. So you don't like the game's story? Open world? City setting? And gameplay? Those things are all opinion.
Here is the reality. If you craved for a military shooter with a long campaign that happens to have pvp elements? This is the game for you. If you are interested in such a game that tells a story and isn't thrown out before launch like Destinty? Again this is your game.
I play this game at 1440p and it is simply stunning to play. I also have played it on console and looks amazing as well. Simply beautiful. I really feel like I am running around new york and just the details on the clothes themselves shows immense care was put into the smallest details.
There is hundreds of hours of entertainment here with no microtransactions to speed up how fast you earn things offered (who knows that could change but great so far). Great value without a doubt regardless how much you paid. There are some reasonable complaints.
There is only a few types of A.I. and the way they move doesn't feel very inspired. The skill system could be deeper and even though safe houses will have stashes. They could really use one closer in the Dark Zone. Back at the DZ entry point. The character customization could use more depth.
But overall this is a sensational game. I'd argue at worst a slightly flawed masterpeice. When I sat down in the early 90s on a computer and thought about what PC gaming could be like. This is the game I wanted. I certainly hope this paves the way for other games like it and becomes the standand going forward. Hopefully Desntiny 2 take away some aspects of this game.
Because simply put this is one of the top games of the year. Like Witcher 3 that came out around this time last year. This will be a hard game to beat for top honor.

Character creation could use more depth - seriously this part of the game really sucks. There are limited options.

5.0,False,"04 2, 2006",A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,B0002RQ3ES,David Foskin,"I actually played it. I decided to give the game a shot at a friend's house, and I found myself completely glued to the TV for three hours, missing Thanksgiving dinner which is arguably the best meal of the year, depending on your family and their cooking skills. It was on Thanksgiving I finally decided it was time for me to buy a PS2 and lose myself in a sea of Metal Gear Solid. After two agonizing weeks of waiting for PS2s to actually be in stock anywhere, I finally had the system and game in hand. No one heard from me for the next three days.

As you may already know, Snake Eater takes place in the 1960s, in the age of the Cold War and Cuban missile crisis, and you do not play as the same Snake from the series' previous games. I could go into detail about the story and the game's characters and talk for ages, but I won't. Metal Gear Solid, despite its failings in Sons of Liberty, has always been about a cinematic engrossing storyline, and Snake Eater is no exception. That said, the less you know about the story before you play, the better. Rest assured the classic Metal Gear trappings are all here and there are many surprises, twists, and revelations that put this a step above the other games. Don't take the fact that I'm refusing to go into the story the wrong way; I just have to ask you to take my word for it when I say that when the curtain finally closed, I found the story to be one of the most well-written and memorable I've ever encountered, videogames and otherwise. The amount of character development squeezed into the last half hour alone make this game well worth the price.

There are many new gameplay elements that will be foreign to even a Metal Gear veteran, and the first thing that's noticeably different in this edition of MGS is the emphasis on stealth. While the game has always been about stealth, your ability to blend in and stay out of sight is more focused and important in Snake Eater. You're exposed to the importance of stealth early on, and you'll spend as much time hiding in the grass as you will running and gunning. There are different camouflage outfits and face paints to find and wear, and these all affect how easily the enemy can spot you, ranging from spotting you across the play area to walking right past you without them even glancing in your direction. You're given a Camo Index to help show you just how well hidden you are, and while it's not necessary and fairly obvious which camo suits do the best job in a given area, it does help in picking out an outfit at certain points. To accent these new elements, your trusty radar is absent and you will have to rely on sight and sounds to detect enemies before they detect you, and act accordingly. This tends to slow down the pace of the game, but tuning in to the game's environments and essentially hunting foes down can be unexpectedly tense and very fun. While the constant overhead view can lead some to frustration in not being able to see ahead of yourself, it really encourages you to be more cautious and it was only minutes after complaining about it that I wound up not really minding.

The additions don't stop at the new focus on remaining hidden at all times. You also have to monitor your health and any injuries you take. To handle this, you are given a Cure option in your menu, and you treat and heal wounds using items you would use in real life like bandages, ointments, stitches, and splints; all of which you'll come across in the field. On paper, it's a fine idea, but the ability to do this any time you like (say, in the middle of a boss fight as soon as you take a hit) turns it into more of a chore than an element of realism, and when you're in the middle of an intense firefight or battle, pausing to cure yourself of bullet wounds or cuts is a drag and pulls you out of the intensity of the fight. Unfortunately, this aspect is not optional.

To make sure you keep track of your injuries and treat them accordingly, the way your health bar works has been changed as well. Your health steadily recharges over time, depending on your stamina, which is shown underneath your health and will decrease over time.. At full stamina, you recover health at a rather speedy pace, and with no stamina, you recover none. Injuries will also impede your health recharging, but the meat of the health bar is your stamina level, which you keep up by eating animals you catch in the wild. Snakes, elk, birds, crabs, and fish are all on the menu, among other things. Some food will give you more stamina than others, and as you catch and try out the different foods, you'll learn what to stay away from and what to stock up on. It's easy to forget about this element, especially later in the game, and if you aren't careful, you'll end up at a difficult area with no stamina, which will make it harder to aim correctly and such. While it's certainly possible to get through such a situation without stamina, recovering health automatically is the only way to recover health, so if you don't have any food you're out of luck.

Controlling Snake is pretty much as it was in Sons of Liberty and Twin Snakes. The game makes use of the Dual Shock's analog buttons, which is great since I haven't seen much use of them outside of racing games and jumping height. The sneaking, fighting, and shooting elements are all essentially the same aside from a few alterations and additions. The gameplay can feel a little dated at times, and while other series are reinventing themselves like Resident Evil, Snake Eater sticks to the tried and true methods of its predecessors, which isn't that big of a deal since it goes above and beyond in its other aspects, such as environmental detail and storytelling.

Speaking of the game's environments, Snake Eater really pushes things on the PS2 as far as they can go in this generation of games. The soft blur over the entire game gives it a realistic touch, and everything from the grass glowing in the sun to character models look great. Face models are especially impressive, and the level of detail in the facial work is worthy of commendation. The wide range of realistic expressions all the characters show is one of those things missing in many games. A character with the same static expression or maybe two or three of them keeps you grounded in the fact that you are playing a game. But Snake Eater is full of subtle and not so subtle touches like this (in and out of gameplay) that really help you get lost in it, and much like the story, are best to be seen for yourself instead of just listening to me ramble about them and how great they are.

Rounding out the game's huge environments is the sound and music, two areas the MGS series has always excelled at. The sound effects are all very realistic aside from a few humorous touches thrown in to lighten the mood at points. The music, done by Harry Gregson-Williams, is on par with that of a big budget Hollywood film. No matter what situation Snake is in, the music fits with it perfectly and does a lot towards heightening the mood and action. I even ended up liking the game's main theme song I initially hated, and its use in a few moments of gameplay wound up feeling right. And of course, who could forget the voice acting. Again, following in the footsteps of the first two MGS games, the game's characters are voiced by top-notch performers. David Hayter is back as Snake, and all the newcomers do a good job with their roles, particularly the stars of the show.

Now, before I go off on a tangent for the next few paragraphs about how much I love the game, I will go into the problems I have with it. First of all, there's the codec transmissions. More specifically, the people on them. Characters like Major Zero and Paramedic aren't as interesting to talk to and identify with as in, say, MGS1. In the first MGS, Campell and Naomi were not only helpful, but important elements of the story. Indeed, Zero and Paramedic are both involved in the big picture, but I ran into no character development while talking to them and hardly ever felt like contacting them, as opposed to MGS1 where I would call my contacts all the time to hear what they had to say.

There are also some parts where the gameplay drags a bit. While each area is certainly beautiful and interesting, some of the indoor sections really magnify the game's quirks, some of which people may find unforgivable. Considering how polished the outdoor environments are and how it requires a completely different strategy that you've spent hours fine-tuning, being back inside a building was a complete switch from laying on the ground in the grass, and it really put me off.

Another issue I had was the boss fights. While the fights themselves were all different and fairly interesting, only one of them really stood out in my mind, which is the sniper battle against The End. It's clearly a love it or hate it situation, considering it's a very long game of cat and mouse. This was one of the times where hunting the enemy approached a zen attitude, where patience and clever thinking pay off. The other fights are all fine and good, but not nearly as memorable. None of the Cobra Unit bosses got very much development either, which led to you becoming detached from the fight and not really caring about it or outcome. While that isn't a lot of complaining, these few things really did bother me during the game, and continue to in retrospect.

Snake Eater has a good amount of replayability, mainly because there's so much to do in the game. There are a dozen of ways to take down an enemy, and over two dozen ways to approach it. Experimenting with different items in your inventory and the environment, when coupled with your imagination, created an endless amount of possibilities, and that's easily the best part about the gameplay. The forest is your sandbox, and you're free to tool around in it however you please. Want to sneak by everyone undetected? Go for it. What about just running into the open, guns blazing? A little blunt, but it works. You could also find a different way to dispatch every enemy in the game, whether it's blowing them up, tranquilizing them, slicing their neck, knocking them out, holding them up, sending a swarm of bees after them, tossing a poisonous snake in their direction, distracting them with a book, surprise the lot of them by manning a gun turret, or just shoot them until they stay down. You've got a lot of freedom in the game, and its top notch presentation makes any decision seem like the best one.

So, since I've mentioned the storytelling so much, let's actually get into it. This is truly where every aspect of Snake Eater shines, from its graphics and sound to the choreography, motion capture, and voice acting. The main draw of the game (and to some, what makes them shirk away) is really the story being told, and the game's beautiful cinemas rival that of a Hollywood production. While there are times when it feels like you're watching more than playing (and often it's true), it helps that the story is so good, and sometimes that will even be the motivating factor of getting through an area. MGS has always felt like an interactive movie, and Snake Eater accomplishes this in spades. That may be a turn-off to some people, but it isn't for me. The story is rich with intrigue, interesting characters, over-the-top action, and great design overall.

Literally every aspect of Snake Eater comes together and works in unison for its massive (and perhaps a bit overdrawn) finale, brimming with confrontational battles, character development, emotion, and a sense of closure that was missing from the previous games. Never before has a game overloaded me with so much in every department all at once, and perhaps I'm a little star-struck by it all, but I loved every minute of it. There are boss fights that make the game well worth your hard earned cash, and that's not even considering the final hour or so, which is well beyond anything previously seen in the game or the two before it.

When all is said and done, Snake Eater achieves what no other game can on such a level: complete immersion into an action-driven interactive movie. I loved the story and the main characters, I loved sneaking around in the woods ambushing baddies, experimenting with different ways of using my items and the environment, and I loved just staring at the game's gorgeous visuals. While other games like Katamari Damacy (I know, we're obsessed with that game; but with good reason) may be more 'fun,' no other game in 2004 toyed with my imagination and emotions more than Snake Eater did. It had a death grip on me for it's entire 18-hour adventure, and even now I'm reliving a few favorite moments from the ending in my head. Even with its shortcomings and slightly aged gameplay, I enjoyed every minute, enough to call this my personal Game of the Year for 2004. Consider this for a moment: I bought a PS2 specifically for this game. So, I essentially paid over $200 for Snake Eater, and am completely satisfied.

This game fixed all of that. It has a good story to it.
The setting takes place in a Planet called LV-1201. Where ""the Company"" is doing research on alien Xenomorphs. But when an egg hatches in an unsecure location and impreginates an officer (who later dies during the embryo's birth). Everything goes out of control.
The Graphics are astounding as always. But the sound has greatly improved. It sounds almost like the movies. The game play has also went up as well. The drawback however is that the game is short. Plus you should have a Pentium 3 at 700 Mhg+ and 256MB RAM+ for a smooth performance.
Like the previous game you get to play the 3 charactors.
THe Predator who has all the high tech gadgets from the plasma Shoulder cannon to the ""Disc"". He comes to the planet just to hunt. But when his friends are captured. He then tries to rescue them. Only to find out that he has some unfinished bussiness (of 20 years) to attend to.
The Human you play is a Marine name Cpl. Harrison. He can have all the firepower a man would need plus all the gadgets to bypass computers and doors and to weld off locks. He is sent with a Platoon to rescue any survivors and to keep the place intact. Only to find out that ""The Company"" has other plans with the Marines.
The Alien you play is the most interesting one of all. You start out as a Facehugger (a spiderlike creature) looking for a host. To a Baby alien looking for food, to an adult drone looking for the hive. He (or she) is the one who started the whole mess at LV-1201.
The alien has no external weapons what so ever. All it hs is his tale and claws like hands. It can also climb on walls and ceilings.

THe story is interesting because the three charactors ""bump"" into each other during the game.
you also get to observe people talking to each other (somtimes taking dialogue from the movies. That makes the game more alive.

5.0,True,"07 8, 2014",A1PO3Z7FXA4Q2E,B00GV4V8XC,Contrabardus,"Very much like one of the older Final Fantasy games. In fact, this is probably the best Final Fantasy game released in the last ten years even though it's not really a Final Fantasy game.

The job system is interesting, the writing is excellent, the character designs are cute, monster designs are interesting, but do fall victim to palate swap syndrome, and the gameplay is definitely a throwback to old school turn based RPGs. Fans of the genre should not miss this game.

I've finished the game without using the ""second"" powers during battle. It requires that you leave the 3DS in standby mode with the game running to recharge this ability. [Close the 3DS while leaving it turned on with the game running]. It's an interesting mechanic, but due to how much of a pain it is to use and the limited number you can have [3] it's not really all that useful. The game can easily be completed without it.

Specials are interesting and require certain actions be taken a set amount of times to use. Usually something like using spells, items, or damage enemies with a specific type of damage a certain amount of times. It varies from class to class and keeps things interesting.

The Brave and Default system is neat and very useful. Brave allows players to burn up Brave Points to allow multiple actions in a single turn. Up to four can be taken in a single turn, and you start with one at the beginning of a battle. You can go negative, but if you do you lose future turns until you get back into positive points again. Default is basically a ""Defend"" command that allows players to build up these points. You can use up to four points in a single turn and thus perform four actions.

It adds a nice layer of strategy to the game and can allow players to lay down a lot of hurt at once on enemies and make good use of various buffs.

The 3D is nice, but easily ignored. I use it, but most will likely turn it off.

If you enjoy the old school Final Fantasy games you really shouldn't miss this. It's very much like a Pre-FF 8 game and has a ton of charm.

5.0,False,"09 13, 2005",A17WUZZ6RPK117,B000930DLE,Andrew Fredrickson,"Ah, wonderful Burnout how I love thee. After picking up 2004's arcade racer of the year I was incredibly excited about hearing Burnout Renvenge to be released later this year. I became (and still addictied) all year round with the game, I have well over 8,000+ takedowns total & just love the hyperadiction nature of the game.

Burnout 3 Takedown changed how you look at a high paced, aggressive, balls-out fun racing game. The insane speeds & perfect framerate (Criterion the developer has never dissapointed me with a bad framerate) combo'd with the addictive nature of destorying your opponents & send then flying accross the road never fails to amuse.

Now with Burnout Revenge, the thrill has gone to new heights. One incredibly wonderful new feature is checking traffic. In the previous Burnout games, dodging traffic while trying to surivive and gain boost on the track was always a challenge. With BO:R the traffic you once feared is now a powerful weapon or shield, basically you run into other cars (some vehicles like buses, big-rigs will still make you crash) and boost them into your rivals, think of them like unguided missles at in your hands. Also the A.I. in the game is a ton more vicious than in Takedown which was just rubberband than anything else (rubberband is just the AI following you and just trying to kill you, no real strategy to dodge).

Making takedowns is a tad togher than before, in BO:3 just a simple push into a wall could make them fly into the oblivion, the cars are much more reasilient to damage and will take more effort to crush. If you happen to be crushed by another AI opponent, you can either do a afterdown takedown like in BO:3 of unleash one of the most desructive abilities you have to offer. In most game modes, you car is like a ticking time bomb, when you have been crahsed, you can activate the Crashbreaker Eliminators which will send everything around the explosion into the far beyond and gain you more boost sections to your bar ( In BO:3 by taking down more cars, your boost meter expanded and you could go faster an faster, and vice versa with your own crahses).

Some new and old modes have been put in, the Cop Pursuit mode from BO:2 is back and is as frantic as ever, with a cop trailing behind you, use the traffic as a weapon to slow down the cop and spped your way to victory, or you can also be the cop tracking down and destroying your rival. Traffic Attack is pretty much crashing in to traffic and scoring as many points as possible before the time is out, its fairly easy to get Gold medals but a fun mode nonetheless, plus a couple more I won't metion, you'll have to see for your self :D.

The track selection is very wide and lots of great new courses, BO:R has more wide open areas for fighting among cars which, also with the multi-tier tracks & shortcuts will be leaving you with a thumping heart rate & big grin on your face. Online is pretty much the same but its better and ranking & finding people to play (and the server is much more stable than when BO:3 launched, people were disconecting & making games were near impossible until EA fixed the servers). The ranking system is similar to games such as Rainbow 6 3 & Halo 2, as you  get better and better, the searching system will find more people of your skill level, while some may like it other might not if you have a lower level buddy who just got the game and might not be able to join, but not a huge deal.

The soundtrack is better than last year's but still not very impressive, some artists like Andy Hunter, CKY, LCD Soundsystem, MxPx are the usual EA Trax fair but with the Xbox version I have you can still use you own soundtracks. Nothing like smashing your friends while listening to to Queens of the Stone Age, Motorhead & The Hiss, good times.

The graphics on both system are almost the same, the PS2 has better lighting and more spark effects while the Xbox has better car models & draw distance, not a huge deal which one you have, but the game is beautiful, running at a solid 60fps (the higher the fps, the more stuff can be moving, exploding around you without slowdown).

So why a 5/5? Its just as easily impressive from when I picked up BO:3, its hyperaddictive nauture just passes on to this sequel. Both games are worth having in your collection.

It was a great system, though don't expect much as far as limit break stuff (trances according to FF9), they take forever to fill and happen at odd tiems when you don't want them to, but they don't go away when you die and last longer than 7's.  8's limitbreaks were too powerful and too easy to acquire.  9's weren't all that exciting excpet for Vivi's, which could do the most damage, just shy of 20,000.  But it is definitely one of the most challenging games as far as sub-quests and the ""Omega"".  Omega being the term referring to the hardest creature in the game.  Emerald and Ruby were the Omega for FF7.
The Game itself was great, good story line, a little leaning towards FF8's as far as the interaction between the two itemized characters.  The storyline was a lot more realistic than 8's depsite the obvious fantasy locale and look.  It was a more traditional FF as it didn't have ""ultimate"" party capabilities.  Like FF7's ability to have everyone cast a double blow of Knights, like 8 where low level characters could still manage to cast high level magic.  It had more like the class system of FF4 and 5 which there in essence with 6 and then exchangable among characters in FF7... virtually nonexistant in 8.  But it does have the original magic names...

It still doesn't compare to the epic nature of FF7 or the great characters and multiple storylines of FF6 (where the main character was not so obvious), no enemy was quite as cool as Sephiroth and no hidden character was ever as fun as Gogo.
I would heavily suggest playing FF8 before this if you already haven't.  For those who love graphics... play the earlier FF's before you play this one, definitely.  For storyline lovers... start out with 5 or 8... placing 4 and 9 afterwards and 6 the 7.  For systems...  Well this is class system with something that worked like 8's junction system except you junctioned items instead of GF's.  4 was clear and cut, 5 was job skills and stuff, 6 and on were almost the same.  It's a great game with hours and hours of side quest play and a lot of hidden things that keep you thinking and running to that players guide.  Playonline does a good job with it.  Some sidequests require you to play for hours just on the sidequest and another requires you to speed your way to the end of the game for secret items.  The card game isn't as functional as 8's or as predicable... in fact the card game could have been left out... but anyway...
I also recommend playing Chronocross and Zenogears for a completely different look of play.  As well as Legends/Secret of Mana.  Chronotrigger is a great game as well, if you can find it that is.
Zelda 64 fans (both of them) would enjoy Megaman Legends and that series.
I would also suggest a good PS for FF8, any of the older PSx's will not perform well and will either freeze up or simply skip some of the coolest CGI's, especially since the Summons like Bahamut and Odin have great appearances.
Definitely worth it, thought look out for a few new status effects and some other suprises like ATE and Synth.",Extreme Recommedation by a full FF Fan,989798400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The controls are very natural and if you have played the Halo series you will pick up GoW in 15 minutes.  The story is weak, but the gmaeplay makes up for all of that.  Wait until you meet your first Berserker...  With an HD set, you will be practically blown away by the graphics. Absolutely everything is fluid and the landscapes are masterpieces never seen before in the realm of console gaming. The blood and gore, in my opinion, make this game all the more fun.  You actually get a feeling of loosing blood in this game as if it were your own. And nothing is better than sniping someone in the face with a pistol and watching their head explode.  The sound is also great, but the weapons sound a bit weak and don't really blend with the ""hardcore"" feel of the game.  The campaign is definetely very short, but that is why there is multiplayer. Only 4 guys a team, but you get used to it fast (plus the maps aren't that big so its fine). I love the fact that if you aren't behind some type of cover, in 3 or 4 seconds you will be a mess of pulp. No running and gunning here... cover is essential. You will die a lot in this game... a LOT. At least until you get used to it. Anyway though, what fun is a game that you don't die in. Hardcore is hardcore and insane is just about impossible.

My obsession with the Super NES allowed me to play all my favorite Game Boy games on the Super NES instead.  Thank you Nintendo for creating this excellent device!

Basically you just stick any ol' Game Boy game inside of the Super Game Boy, insert the Super Game Boy into the Super NES like you would any other game, and that's it.  Very simple, and *very* convenient.

Other things you can do on your Super Game Boy is write words or draw pictures on the background using a variety of different crayon colors.  You use the directional pad on the Super NES controller to make it happen.  Use your imagination to create something amazing.

Oh, and get this- you can even change the actual color of the game on screen to ANY color you like!  There must be a million options here because you can mix and match any color you like.  I love it.

There's also set backgrounds that Nintendo built into the Super Game Boy, such as curtains, adorable kittens, a beautiful day outside, etc.  Not much variety here, but that's quite alright with me because the selling point is supposed to be all the different ways you can color up the game.  Excellent stuff.

  Pros:
  This game is almost too fun because of the motion capture technology.  It captures the very essence of what his fighting style really is and just how fast and agile he can really move.  The Graphics aren't all that great but hey, for 2004 it could be worse.  One of the greatest things about it is that is uses the analog sticks instead of the square or circle or triangle button.  Also, because the analog can go in any direction, Jet Li can attack in all four directions.  Another thing that's very innovative is the use of the R1 and L1 buttons, R1 being block, holding R1 and L1 to counter attack, and hold down L1 for Adrenaline.  The cool thing is when you block you just dodge any incoming attacks that an enemy/ies throws at you.  Then you just hold down L1 and flick the analog to Counterattack. The catch is that you can only dodge and do counters for so long, which is indicated by two bars right under your health.  Also, Counterattacks deplete your Adrenaline bar, so use them wisely. Oh yeah, Adrenaline.  Your Adrenaline bar fills up with the more attacks you get on an enemy/ies.  (Usually they start you off with full Adrenaline)  Getting to use weapons was a very nice touch.  Although the Gun Controls are a little tricky at first, once you get the hang of it it's not long before you start gunnin' down enemies with ease.  You also get to use swords, pipes, bats, bats with spikes, and even a chicken in one level.  Another awesome feature, is that the levels are all split into Chapters. I know, you're probably thinking as in a lot of big levels. But it's not.  The chapters are all little things like some of the small stuff that you do. Kinda like if you were in one spot for a while you can go there. Finally, the best thing is that when you beat the game, you can play it on hard mode, and you get two outfits (one is from ""Once Upon a Time in China"" and the other is from ""Fist of Legend"" or something closely related). Ok now for the Bad.

Cons:

  This game was a little iffy on some of the levels.  Most were very easy.  Even the Final Boss is easy (but very fun). Some of the missions were so hard I can't believe that my brother and I got to the final boss.  The Controls may be very well done, but the only thing is that there's no leveling up or anything that you can add to Jet. He just has the same 5 hits in each direction (which isn't bad, but it gets really annoying).  The Weapons weren't really all that varied. The weapon was always the same type. In other words: it's always related to a sword (i.e. a crowbar, bat, a chicken...)so it was always the same length.  It would have been nice if they could have added a Bo Staff or something...  Another thing, was that the new outfits aren't all that great.  Because they each have their own little perk which is either speed or more adrenaline (actually that's it) their health goes down easier which is not all that great.

  All in all, this game may have had room for improvement, But it's still one of THE best martial art games out there. BUY IT NOW!!!! STOP WASTING TIME ALREADY!!!","One of, If not the Best Martial art game I've ever played",1188950400,,,

Animal Crossing is a game with a unique plot. That is to say, no plot. But, surprisingly, that is a good thing. A VERY good thing! It gives you a lot of free reign. Basically, it's a 'Slice of Life'. Okay, enough with my ramblings (I'm boring you, aren't I?)

When you first start the game, you are in a taxi. It's a rainy day, and the taxi driver, (a turtle/kappa named Kapp'n) is asking you questions. First, he asks your name, and where you're going. (You don't have a preset name or anything, you make it up!)

Then, when the annoy turtle stops talking, the sky clears up, and you begin your new life in town! But before long, you discover that your new house comes with a price. 19,000 bells! (bells are the currency) In order to help pay off your huge debt, you must work for the racoon Tom Nook.

As you have (hopefully) noticed, you aret he only human. The rest of the townsfolk are animals! And so, your new life officially begins! You can chat the day away with your animal neighbors, buy hats and other attire at the local clothing shop, buy furniture for your home at Tom Nook's store, go fishing, bug catching, UFO-hunting (No, seriously. There are UFO's in the game. Their driven by a seagull named Gulliver)

There are so many things in this game, it's IMPOSSIBLE to get bored! Not to mention Holidays, Wishing Stars to...er...wish upon, Fishing Tournies, Bug Hunting Competitions too!

The best part of this game are the townsfolk, in my opinion. There's an ENOURMOUS variety of animals that come and go. Some you'll really get attached too, and other you'll be begging tha they leave! For example, Two of my favorite neighbors, Alice the  Koala, and Marina the Octopus moved away. I miss them. I also have two annoyign neighbors, an annoyign squirrel who's name I dare not remember, and a moody oenguin name Hopper!

You can write letters to villagers, and even become best friends.  Once, I had a very funny coversation with Marina the Octopus

Marina: You know, latwly I've really been getting into seafood. That's a bit odd, considering I AM seafood...

Animal Crossing: Wild World will never fail to surprise you! The graohics are a HUGE step up from the Gamecube version. But the music, I wish was the same as the Gamecube's.

5.0,False,"03 13, 2015",A3HPHOBMUG08CS,B00PDRZG9U,Brian Woo,"As a fan of turn-based strategy games, Codename STEAM is a niche title that deserves to be given a chance. Why does it deserve a chance? Why is it a niche title? Well that's because it's a brand new I.P. from a company notorious for sequels/spinoffs/remasters. Oh and did I mention Intelligent Systems, developers of the Fire Emblem and Advanced Wars series, are behind it?!?! Not only have Nintendo and IS granted our wishes with a new I.P., they've made a great one at that! This game is like a mix between Fire Emblem and Valkyria Chronicles (real time 3rd person shooting). It offers a story mode, some multiplayer modes, and streetpass as well if you're into that.

The story is witty and told in a comic book style, which is why the graphics look the way they look. Trust me, it definitely looks better in person and in 3D. It introduces you to famous American themed characters such as Henry Fleming, John Henry, the Lion from the Wizard of Oz, and many others that I don't want to spoil for you. They aren't exactly fleshed out, the dialogue is corny, and the story altogether isn't deep, but its one that you shouldn't take seriously and just have fun with. You can tell this game is all about the gameplay experience. To put it simply, it takes place in London and your team called S.T.E.A.M. (Strike Team Eliminating the Alien Menace) is trying to fend off aliens to save humanity. I'll let you find out for yourself who's the leader of your team. Before every battle, you assemble a team of 4 that can be customized with sub weapons. Each character also has a unique special ability so the replayability seems endless. If you're into collectibles, you can gather coins from killing enemies or destroying boxes, and you can find the 3 COGs spread across each map to upgrade your steam supply as well. The only gripe I have with this game is the ""Enemy Turn"" segments where it could take up to 20-30 seconds to finish. Apparently the enemies actually strategize in this game and don't make pre-programmed moves like in Fire Emblem. It's not that big of a deal to me.

I haven't touched online multiplayer yet, but from what i've seen on previews they look pretty solid. There's deathmatch where your team faces off against another human opponent team. There's a mode where you try to collect more coins than your opponent, in which you can steal from by shooting them. And finally there's a 1 on 1 mech showdown that sort of resembles a boxing match, but take the last mode with a grain of salt.

All in all, do yourself a favor and get this game. Support not only a new and rare I.P., but a great one from the minds that brought you Fire Emblem and Advanced Wars. If you're into turn-based strategy games, this is a no brainer.",A great niche title that definitely deserves a chance,1426204800,25,,

I didn't but this game to be to different, I bought this game to kill, shoot, stab, bash, club and run over zombies.  So far I have had this experience in spades.  The only problems I am having is I need to find a place to take a shower as the stupid infected keep smelling me from a mile away.  Other than that I am good.  One really cool thing about this game is you get to experience hordes.  I am calling hordes of anything over 5.  You get more then 3 infected after you and you don't have a gun you are dead.  Those things are extremely fast.  I really enjoy this game.  So far the weapons are awesome.  I only have one lame gun, seriously, it is a lame gun.  It does do well against suiciders.  Regardless, the extras in the box, and including the box are cool.  Well worth the money.  A great game all in all and lots of land to explore.  I could not believe how much land there is to explore.  Almost like Skyrim jr. land size with zombies.  I have been able to get to 90% of the places I have seen.  You point, you run and drive and you can almost get everywhere.  Fun game, don't listen to the people whining about how it is so much like the other one.  Actually, this is better then the first one in my book for the hordes alone.  The most I have had to fight so far is 15.

ONLINE VERSUS
This is definitely my least favorite part of the game. While it is some fun, there is nothing to keep me coming back and gets repetitive and boring. Can be played with bots, but it's still the weakest mode for me. It doesn't compare to CoD or even Battlefield which have a ton of unlocks. And I'm not talking weapon skins or characters because those are useless.
7/10

BEAST MODE
This is good for laughs, but not taken too seriously, at least by me. I cleared all 12 waves in half an hour, and have no desire to go back. Good fun, but no lasting appeal.
7.5/10

HORDE MODE
This is really great. Probably even more enjoyable than the campaign. I beat all 50 waves with another friend and we really enjoyed earning that 10 gamerscore. A job well done, with fortifications, upgrades, and a ton of enemies to kill. Also very challenging on higher waves.
9.5/10

CAMPAIGN
We did not finish this yet, but we are on Act 3 Chapter 2 and really enjoying it so far (on Hardcore). I think I've played enough to write about it. The story is nothing special, but good enough to keep you interested to continue playing. So far, two acts +1 chapter and we're about 5 hours in. Length is a little bit short, but this is a lot of fun. Can't wait to purchase the campaign DLC in December!
9/10

OVERALL
I won't purchase any beast, horde, or versus DLC because there is not enough incentive to keep playing, but will definitely get the campaign DLC in december (1200 MSP). Game is a lot of fun and highly recommend at full price.

I specifically chose a PS3 over an xbox 360 as my new console for the price, the free online PSN (including Netflix; although you obviously still need a paid Netflix account), and games like 'The Last of Us', 'Ni No Kuni', 'Final Fantasy 13', and 'Little Big Planet'. Another thing to consider is that although the PS3 (unlike the Xbox360) supports full 1080i HD, few games actually run at that resolution. As of now, the only game I own that will run above 720p is Final Fantasy 13. Oh, this bundle also includes a free month of Playstation Plus...But the code expires 3/31/14. I haven't used it yet, but I will give it a try. I just hope that when I cancel it after my month is up I can still use any fun freebies I download with it.

I don't want the new consoles yet, as they have nothing to play other than sports and FPS games ATM. Really sad for me that both the new gen consoles aren't releasing any RPGs until near the end of 2014. Also...for ~500 bucks I could almost buy a new PC, lol.

Some brick and mortar retailers (Gamestop, etc.) want ~250 just for a used system, no game, and smaller hard drives. Amazon has a good price for what you get. The only drawback is I had to also get an HTMI cable, and 2nd controller. It'd be nice if they at least included an HDMI cable...No one includes 2 controllers anymore...So I can't really be mad about that. So, I got the PS3 new owners kit too. It raised the total to 300 bucks, but, now I have everything I need.

I love the fact that I can get game demos from the PSN, and I don't have to buy those plastic 'minutes' cards like Xbox 360/One makes you. It was a shock for me to see a console act more like a PC, lol...But it's easy to use/navigate, and I like it. Typing in passwords and such is a pain with a controller, but, the PS3 accepts a USB keyboard.

If you don't have one, I'd recommend it. The games are stunning, affordable (if you buy older games, and used games) and there's tons of them out there. Also, there's new PS3 releases coming for at least the rest of 2014. It's not a 'dead' system yet.","Cool System, Good price.",1392336000,3,,

If you're just looking for an all-around fun time without having to invest too much effort into learning overly-complicated controls, you'll probably agree with all the hype about this game.

Personally, I don't need a lot of plot with my mini-games... what on Earth would be the point of that? Read a book if you want a story! Also, while many of the moves are repeated in different games, the fact is that this game still has far more variety than most. There's probably around 15 different styles of play: swinging the remote and pressing a button to throw a cow, drumming along to the beat of a song, tilting the remote like one of those wooden mazes with a marble in it, tracing outlines on the screen with a pointer, and many more. People who say it's too repetitive aren't considering that fact that every single other game out there is even more repetitive and requires a far lower # of moves to play. You may not find it funny because everyone has their own unique sense of humor, but most people are going to enjoy the humor at least some.

People should know though that there is some very blatant, in your face homosexual stereotyping in this game.

Obviously Darkstalkers is not Capcom's priority in fighting games hence it not known very well here in North America (my first experience with Darkstalkers was with Capcom Fighting Evolution in 2004).

When I first put Darkstalkers into my PSP I tried playing on normal with Morrigan, I made it up to the last fight and got whooped over and over again (my problem lies in not being able to push the buttons fast enough to pull off the super moves, I'm much better with a arcade stick) So I went into the options and put the control scheme to easy and found a very enjoyable fighting game. With the simplified difficulty control scheme I was pulling off combos and smacking the AI around like a pro.

DarkStalkers Chronicles Includes the first 3 Darkstalkers games as well as all the endings from those games, though they are low quality. Darkstalkers Chronicles also includes what's called  a tower mode, you have to travel 100 floors in this mode all the while your being thrown handicaps (no blocking for example) while traveling the 100 floors you unlock pictures from all the Darkstalkers games. There is also a local multiplayer mode, and a Wi-Fi mode, but the Wi-Fi mode does not work, the option is there but nothing happens when you select it. The graphics in Darkstalkers is done in the typical Capcom anime style which is some really high quality 2D stuff, everything is done in great detail, I really enjoy looking at it, the music is also pretty fun to listen to as it is the exact same music that plays on the arcade versions.  You can see all Darkstalkers has to offer in around 6 hours. That's all the endings, openings, and pictures unlocked.

I traded in my 360 towards a PS4, which I had no intention of ever buying, so I could get my hands on Bloodborne.  Oh how I missed DS!

Bloodborne looks great compare to Dark Souls 2, but Dark Souls 2 on Xbox One looks awesome compared to Xbox 360.  The game play is smoother, more responsive, and feels faster.  The change of mobs placement is great, its a weird feeling to know the map like the back of your hand and then still feel nerves as you walk around a familiar corner.

I figured on a relatively good-looking game, with good single/local multi - player modes with average to poor online play. But then I was TOTALLY BLOWN AWAY. Online play is addictive, competitive, and friendly. There are next to no loading times at all for both off-line and online play.

Don't let any kind of ""kiddie"" label fool you. This arcade racing made not only for the hardcore gamer -- but really anyone who likes games. Trust me, even when you're in last place, you'll be having a ton of fun.

Some of the single player offline races seems too easy to me, but you can always find more challenge in using different karts/racers. Others complain about battle mode, but I honestly don't see the problem with it. Sometimes items left on the track seem to vanish (namely bananas), but they'll typically disappear after more than 1 lap of the race has been completed so I don't consider it much an issue.

1. Super comfortable and lightweight. I wear glasses and it is not a problem for me whatsoever. I wear this headset for hours without discomfort. The ear pads and headband are soft and plush which makes wearing this thing a joy. Also, I don't feel like my head is in a vice, but rather has just the right amount of pressure to rest on my head without falling off if I move around. The ear cups are pretty deep as well, which makes it so that your ears are not resting on the actual drivers. Really nice!

2. The open design is great for keeping your ears ventilated. I have tried closed headsets in the past which caused my ears to get sweaty. The open design is also really nice for when you are talking into the microphone. It allows you to properly hear yourself talking.

3. Sound quality from the drivers is really good. I am using this headset with an Auzentech Prelude 7.1 card and games and music both sound fantastic. I have tried other ""gaming"" headsets such as the Siberia V2 and the difference is night and day. The V2's cannot compete, it's not even close. I was comparing the specs for the G4ME ONE headset against other Sennheiser headphones (not headsets), and they are somewhere around the 558 level. The Frequency Response Level and Impedence is identical between the two, but the SPL is higher for the G4ME ONE. It would be interesting to be able to listen to the 558's and other Sennheiser headphones to see how they actually sound compared to the G4ME ONE drivers.

4. The microphone is top notch. My voice is crystal clear in every game recording that I do. Also, in the middle of the microphone arm it is a rubberized texture. Not really needed but it's a nice touch that I personally really appreciate. I also appreciate that the microphone, when placed in the upright position, is muted. My old headset was a Sennheiser PC 161 which also has a pretty decent microphone. I would say that the G4ME ONE is a notch higher in sound clarity. Compared to the Siberia V2 which I mentioned earlier, the G4ME ONE is so much better. In fact, one of the reasons I returned the V2's is because the microphone is total trash.

5. Aesthetics - this headset is beautiful overall. From the color scheme to the build design - absolute beauty.

6. Build Quality - everything feels solid and well made. The cable is nicely braided and comes with an attached velcro fastening strap that is very useful for tidying up the cable if you don't need the whole length. The analog connectors have a nice rubberized feel to them as well. I would also like to add here that having the volume switch built into the right ear piece is very intuitive and nicely done.

The only thing that I would like to see is an included headphones bag. These aren't cheap and it would be nice to keep them in a bag when I'm not actively using them in order to keep the dust off.

This time, Mario has to take to outer space, exploring dozens of galaxies in search of power stars. The power stars are used to power the Comet Observatory, a ""space station"" that Mario uses to get to other galaxies. After collecting enough power stars, Mario can go to the center of the universe to rescue Peach.

But to the system, I really loved the original Xbox great graphics, games and the online was great. Microsoft has brought a great system to the market. One of the stupid things Microsoft has done was make a core package for people who don't want to spend money. Don't buy it, it is a waste of money. Go with the Premium package. Yes it cost $100 bucks more but you get $200 worth of accessories with it. I know people say wait for the other systems, but that is up to you. I personally think you should get this system. The reason why is that the PS3 is going to be really expensive like $500 and even Sony admitted it and with this system you are going to get the same thing if not something better and even the same games but for less. The Revolution maybe nice for a five year old but if you are a 19 year old like me it won't do it for you. It lacks the more Adult themed games that people in my age bracket like. Also not to mention it's graphics are going to be inferior to the 360 and PS3 and finally it will use a very unconventional control. The one nice feature I do like about the Revolution is that you can download classic Nintendo games; but that isn't enough to get me to buy it. The only thing that angers me is that Microsoft didn't make enough of the consoles so I can be waiting until next year to get one. But hey Sony did the same to me with the PS2 back in 2000 and I payed out of the nose getting one 3 months after the release. I would also advise that you get Broadband to fully enjoy what the 360 can do. I have it and it changed my console gaming experience. Also you should get a HDTV to really enjoy the graphics. I don't have one yet but within a year I should have one. Also don't listen to that irrational kid who wrote that terrible review. The kid doesn't know anything about the system and he shouldn't judge it. He doesn't even know that Nintendo has slid into third place in the console race. Many people has said that PS2 got first and Xbox got second so you know where the Gamecube is at. Anyway sorry to write so much but get the system and you should be pleased. But you should wait to buy it, they want well over $1000 for the system and that is a waste. Wait a few months and you will be able to get one for less than half the asking price. Get it here in another few months and you might even get a great deal.

It is a great system, some of the launch games were not that great but I can see they are coming. So I am happy overall, only thing was that I wasn't able to set up the Xbox 360 media center.

You get everything you need to unlock a whole lot of gaming bliss. Lets start with the big ticket items.

HALF LIFE 2: If you do not have this already, then this is the PERFECT package to get it in. The game itself is amazing. It gives you the full monty of gaming gooodnes. You get great graphics, outstanding game play and a well developed story and characters.  But like the man says, WAIT there's more! Once you have Half Life 2 installed, the whole world of MODS opens up to you. MOD stands for Modification. These are things that folks create to allow Half Life 2 (HL2) to become an entirely new game. You want to play a first person shooter with soldiers vs terrorists? There is a free MOD out there to do it. You want to play as a viking versus pirates? There is a free MOD for it. On and on it goes, with tons of free content out there that can extend the gaming fun of HL2. Just start googling ""Half life 2 MOD"" and you are on your way. Then there are MODs that you can pay for, like Day of Defeat:Source, which gives you a World War II themed first person shooter.

PORTAL: You are going to love this one! I even let my 7 and 8 year old sons play this. It is a puzzle environment that can really get your brain going. You have a gun that shoots two portals, go through one to come out of the other one. You use it to get out of rooms and the puzzles are great.

EPISODE 1: The next chapter in the story for HL2.

EPISODE 2: The second episode in the Half Life story line. This is another great extension of the overall story arc. Once you have HL2, Episode 1 and Episode 2, you have the whole deal to date.

TEAM FORTRESS 2: Remember those MODs I told you about? Well this is one of them. It turns HL2 into a first person shooter that feels like being inside a 1940's Warner Brothers cartoon. But in this cartoons, there are lots more explosions and bazookas.

I have played a whole lot of games, and this one is the most complete package anyone could ask for. Whether you are a gaming novice looking for your first introduction to computer gaming or your an old hand, this is a MUST BUY.

Do you already own HL2? No problem, you can simply gift this second copy of HL2 to someone else via steam. Share the bliss with someone else who has not yet taken the plunge.",The fun comes in more ways than you might think... and it's better than cake.,1198886400,3,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

The storyline is fairly straightforward. You're the new kid in town, and your parents give you a new robot as a gift. Right away you're drawn into the local team battles, with one team needing your help. You discover you have a talent for robot battles and begin moving your way through battle after battle.

The roaming around town aspect is fun and relaxed. There are lots of kids for you to talk with, and lots of little storylines to learn about. On the other hand, if you're bored with talking to people, you can walk past most of them and just get to the battle parts.

For a battle, you get an arena setting with obstacles and walls. You run around the arena shooting and blasting at your enemy, jumping out of the way. The customization really makes this quite fun.

The graphics and storyline are very kid friendly. I love the training as you go that they set up. Where other games can be quite confusing to start with, Custom Robo Arena DS does a great job of easing you into the system without boring you to death. You start with just a few things to remember, and they build on from there. I give them a lot of kudos for that.

The music is a casual techno song - not too thrilling, but not bad either. You can always turn down the volume if you're not a fan.

I've always loved playing from behind the visor of Samus's helmet, and I was glad to have the opportunity to do so again in this game, but also playing retro style brought back a lot of nostalgia and the way we used to enjoy great video games. It was simple, and it was fun, and I appreciated the blend.
I really enjoyed Jessica Martin's interpretation of Samus's personality - the strong woman with a military past, yet bearing wounds and expressing the emotions her pain brings her - and I thought she did a wonderful job bringing our beloved Bounty Hunter to life. After all, the Chozo said their Newborn had wounded eyes.
The game almost played out like a mystery novel, having you race from one room to the next in an effort to figure out what was going on, and it was fun trying to put together the missing pieces of the puzzling Bottle Ship.
The cinematic scenes were a very welcome addition, and I hope they continue to do so in future Metroids. My only complaint is that Other M is too short - it's a sprint to the finish, leaving you wanting for more at the end.

We have 4 Asus ROG gaming laptops in our family, and have always used some model of Redragon mouse with them, usually the Nemeanlion model.  Admittedly, this was mostly due to the red/black color scheme looking really good with the Asus ROGs (haha), but about 1.5 years later, these mice have more than proved themselves.  Recently, my son's mouse died.  Not sure why, but it was over a year old and was well used (died a valiant death!), so I gave him my Nemeanlion model to use, while I ordered him a replacement. Much to my dismay, the Nemeanlion was going to take extra long to get here for some reason (I'm spoiled by 2-day Prime shipping), so I looked at the other models and saw this beast. I'm really glad I did.

On smaller, standard sized mice, I tend to roll my hand around the narrower mouse, which tends to eventually cause hand cramps after a long time gaming.  The Mammoth is wide enough that I just have my hand laying on top of it, much more relaxed than normal, allowing for many hours of gaming comfort.  Being able to fine tune the weight is very nice, and downloading the driver from the Redragon website allows for full custom configuration of the extra buttons.  About the only thing ""negative"" that I can say about it (which really isn't a negative) is that 16400 DPI is just ridiculous overkill and basically unusable.

Before you know it, you're producing tiny little works of ... well, okay, maybe it's not Van Gogh, but it's a lot more impressive than you thought you were capable of. Does anyone know where I can get an easel and some brushes cheap?

That's not to say this is the same as being in an actual art class, or even using an actual pencil or brush. (It's not as messy, for one thing, and you don't have to notice that the girl on your left is doing a REALLY good job and get depressed with your own efforts.) It's also not going to give you any basic ability you don't already have. For that reason, some will find it frustrating beyond measure. At the same time, who knows what capacity in yourself you might discover if you try? And it's certainly cheaper and easier than taking an actual art class.",Surprisingly horizon-stretching,1300492800,,,

The combat is intense and bloody, the visuals are terrific and bloody, and the paranormal storyline is creepy and bloody.  Yes, blood and gore are everywhere - and the worst carnage you can manufacture with your array of weapons is nothing compared to the powers of the mysterious Alma to eviscerate all of those responsible for the great wrongs done to her over the course of many years.  It's science fiction meets horror meets engineered carnage at its best.

Here's all you need to know about the First Encounter Assault Recon: they're the guys you call when the military's elite Special Forces can't get the job done.  You don't know exactly what is going on as you first enter the fray - except that the situation is pretty bad.  As mission point man (with special reflex skills that effectively allow you to momentarily slow down time whenever you want), your job is to kill or capture one Paxton Fettel, a specially engineered psychic commander who has taken command of a battalion of supersoldier clones and unleashed a massacre that threatens to spread throughout the city.  As you proceed through all the different intervals, you'll learn a lot more about Paxton Fettel, the even more mysterious and dangerous Alma, and the secret project that gave birth to all of the monstrosities that keep coming at you.  Much of your growing knowledge will come in the form of psychic visions featuring Fettel or Alma communicating with you directly.  Fettel in particular likes to appear, deliver creepy messages, and disappear fairly often.  It makes for a terrific and absorbing atmosphere of dread and anxiety.

As you make your way through three different structures over the course of the game, you have to contend with multiple enemies.  As if facing all of the cloned supersoldiers isn't challenge enough, you also face resistance from Armacham Technology Corporation security forces trying to destroy all evidence of the super-secret project and a host of supernatural minions unleashed by Alma - as well as Paxton Fettel himself.

While the game's hardware requirements were fairly steep when it was released in 2005, you can enjoy the amazing F.E.A.R. visual experience on any decent gaming computer today.  The atmosphere is very much akin to that of Asian horror movies, with Alma generating a presence much like that of Sadako in Ringu.  As enjoyable as the dark, spectacular psychic visions are, the best and creepiest shots feature a young Alma spectrally manifesting herself somewhere on the periphery of your vision.  The music and sound effects add extra doses of darkness to the whole atmosphere.  Play this game alone at night in a darkened room, and you may well find yourself fumbling to turn the lights back on at some point.  This really is as creepy a game as I've ever played.

If there is any downside to this game, it's the fact that it can become somewhat repetitive at times.  At each of the three main locations featured, you will have to wend your way through mazes of similar areas.  In addition, the bad guys - who you are able to monitor when they are close - also tend to shout the same sorts of instructions as they search for and attempt to kill you.  It would also be nice to be able to interact a little more closely with the environment (and to actually leave bloodstained footprints behind after you walk through a pool of freshly spilled blood), but none of these small quibbles really matter in the end.  F.E.A.R. delivers a paranormal horror shoot-`em-up experience like no other game I've played.",FEAReaking awesome FPS,1350777600,,,

The controllers were huge at the time but over the years the Xbox controllers shrank now there are diferent varietys of Xbox controllers.

Sorry Nintendo Lovers But Nintendo..is..DYING and I repeat DYING Nintendo is not coming out with good new titles just plain sequels. It hasn't made a good game since metriod prime. Although maybe a miracle will happen When Legend of Zelda comes out later in 2005. Nintendo just lost the company Rare to Microsoft Because Microsoft has more money and better games than Nintendo.

I bought this mouse for use with my laptop- the main reasons I chose this one is the low price, vaguely similar aesthetics, and braided cord. Its also important to me that the mouse feels good. I work in 3d modeling and as much time as I spend clicking, its really worthwhile to have a decent mouse.

 I'm using a razer Deathadder with my desktop, and some things that I noticed coming from that include-

-The spacing is just a bit wider. For someone with bigger hands this might not be an issue, but my pointer an middle finger sit noticeably farther apart. This takes some getting used to for my smaller hands.

-the mouse is basically symmetrical with the exception of the two thumb buttons on the left side. This is in contrast to my deathadder's smooth contours that fit my right hand really well. Basically this means my pinky finger has no real 'home' while i'm gripping the mouse, so I end up in a bit more of a 'claw' grip. Thats fine for me.

5.0,False,"08 8, 2007",A2TUCS8O6AJXKJ,B000HX1P72,--,"""The Darkness,"" from the studio that brought Xbox fans ""The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape From Butcher Bay,"" is a first-person shooter based on the dark comic book series of the same name. And like the aforementioned ""Riddick,"" it further proves that these guys know what makes a cool video game adaptation.

You assume the role of Jackie Estacado, adopted nephew of Mafia boss Paulie Franchetti, as he reaches his 21st birthday and stumbles blindly into the dark destiny of his family line. The opening sequence is a knockout, and thrusts you headlong into the gritty world of organized crime in this fictional version of New York City. The ensuing police chase, car crash, and demise of your companions, a couple of Mafia thugs, is by itself worth the price of admission.

Jackie soon finds himself on the receiving end of his Uncle Paulie's wrath, which brings him into contact with an evil entity known as The Darkness. This demonic parasite latches itself to Jackie, and simultaneously aids and defies him in his quest for revenge -- a quest with many shocking twists and turns that I dare not spoil in this review.

The first-person gunplay of ""The Darkness"" is itself quite extraordinary. Shooting people is rarely this satisfying, thanks to copious amounts of gore, better-than-average rag doll physics, and a satisfying real world arsenal that never grows stale. But Jackie's Darkness powers certainly add the icing to this already tasty cake, allowing him to sprout serpentine tentacles that devour the hearts of his foes (for the purpose of leveling up Darkness powers)... and that's just the beginning. Other Darkness abilities allow you to impale your foes and swing them wildly around at the end of a glistening appendage, creep across the floor as a serpent and put a hole through an unsuspecting victim, and open up black holes that devour several enemies at once. It's all extremely gratifying, and provides ample means to destroy the opposition.

Some Darkness abilities are less compelling than others, however. The Darkness Guns, for instance, rarely serve a useful purpose, while the aforementioned black holes act as overpowered grenades, and can sometimes shift the balance too far in the player's favor. Nonetheless, in a game where just shooting guys would be great, these alternatives do their part in further distinguishing the gameplay and making you feel like a real, bona fide bad@$$ with a sick, sadistic evil streak.

Of course, the game isn't complete without the ability to summon Darklings -- funny gremlin-like beasties that will back you up in a pinch. With multiple varities, such as Gunners (equipped with massive chain guns), Berserkers (who ambush opponents and cut them down to size), and Kamikazes (they go BOOM!), things don't ever seem to get old.

Production values are great across the board, from the near-flawless sound effects to the strength of the visuals, which depict a grimy New York City connected by subway tunnels and desolate streets under a sky of seemingly endless night. Maybe the streets are too desolate, point of fact, given that the City That Never Sleeps seems to be very asleep indeed, but it all adds to chilling atmosphere.

The game takes a stab at the slightly open-ended nature of ""Butcher Bay,"" but doesn't quite nail it. This also results in lots and lots of walking between key action setpieces, and backtracking is never all that fun in any game. This game's attempts at non-linearity come across as tacked on, if anything, and will only do it for those who desperately want to drag out the experience.

Despite a strong, compelling storyline, the Mafia element of ""The Darkness"" never met a cliche it didn't like. The Godfather meets Goodfellas dialog can be groan-inducing at times, especially all references to ""respect."" There was a better way to handle this material, but this is a mere nitpick at worst.

5.0,False,"03 31, 2010",A1OUKEY9UYTV3H,B0029ZUPYK,David Allen,"Dante's Inferno, wow, what a great game. I came across this game by chance. I saw the ad's during the Super Bowl, and thought man that looks a bit tough, but never considered buying the game. At the time I was playing my way through another great game, God of War. But along comes my anniversary, and my lovely wife who knows me so well, gave me Dante's Inferno as a gift.

Getting started is quick and easy, just place the UMB disc into the drive on your PSP and press the power button. You will be prompted to Start a New Game, and given an opportunity to choose your difficulty level. The hardest level Inferno, its disabled until you complete the game on any other difficulty level first.

Dante's Inferno is a story about Dante straight from the poem Dante's Inferno. He has returned from the Crusades to find his true love, Beatrice. But she is not to be found. She has been murdered along with her father, and her soul has been sold into the infernal fires of hell.
Dante goes in after her. He must search, fight, puzzle solve, and climb his way to the inner circle and fight Lucifer himself and save not only the soul of his beloved Beatrice, but his own soul as well.

The art work and graphics are extremely well done, as are the animations, music and sound effects. There is a lot of nudity in the game, mainly women with bare breasts. No sex scenes however, and no genitals. All are perfectly done. Control of Dante walking and turning is very
smartly done by the joystick nub only. Dante has other moves he can make as well such as jumping, climbing, dodging, rope swinging and rappeling. Movement is generally very accurate and responsive. Save points are generally well placed throughout the game. You save when you
see and can approach a statue of Beatrice. These are hard save points. If you power down, you can reload these. As you play along however, the game is keeping secret save points. You cannot tell where they are, and as long as you continue to play, if you die, the game will place you at the last secret save point. But if you leave the game you will have to start from a hard save point. So keep that in mind while playing and your half way through a tough part, and have to leave for a while. You may want to keep the game in pause if you can, especially if you just beat a hard area or boss so you do not have to go through that area or boss again.

Some skills and accuracy is required in some areas. Game play was challenging enough for an advanced gamer, and thorough enough to keep you occupied. There are a few areas that are a bit difficult and could have been designed a bit better. Those that come to mind are an area with
a pit where there is a revolving set of gates. Your required to make your way to the opposite side of the pit jumping gaps and the moving gates. Not hard at all really, but on the other side your required to jump to an alcove to absolve or punish a damned soul, and you have to hit a very small spot that you cannot see or you fall to your death. Another is an area near the end of Limbo where you must climb down a post made of bones, cross hand over had across a rope then grab a rope and swing, and repeat, and repeat, and repeat. They designed the ropes to be as far apart as they could so you have to do a perfect jump to get to the next one. A frustrating area, the key is to use the joystick nub in the direction your jumping to to give you a little boost. Lastly is an area near the end of Heresy, where your required to run full tilt, avoid falling obstacles, jump gaps, run along a curved platform, jump off onto a platform that immediately starts to crumble, turn and run to another smaller platform that also starts immediately to crumble, run, jump and rappel to a wall. Then you can rest, but you cannot save, and they should have, but did not put a secret save point here. After you rest you have to jump across a gap to another ledge, move to one side and as it crumbles jump to a ramp. Proceed down the ramp until it crumbles, turn right slightly and jump to a tiny platform, turn left immediately run and jump to yet another small platform as as soon as it starts to crumble the wall in front of you falls and reveals a climbable wall you can jump to and climb up then you can save. You miss one move, or make one wrong step you go all the way back to the beginning.

Puzzles are not difficult, and the developers did include a lot of hints. Camera angles were generally very good, but in the case of a few hard frustrating areas as mentioned above, part of the problem is the camera was not keeping up so your view was partially a best guess. The
hardest puzzle was in the second half of Gluttony. This was probably the one place the camera angles were truly unhelpful. Grapple points, and/or climb points are noted by a small purple glow to help guide you. There are power ups along the way, and they are generally quite plentiful. These are in the form of fountains. Green fountains regenerate your health when broken open. Purple fountains regenerate your magic powers aka Mana when broken. You have a meter at the top left part of the screen showing your health and Mana levels. There are other important items you will need to collect while on your journey. One of these is souls. These are white orbs that you will find in red fountains, and you will also get some when certain battles are completed, and certain actions are taken. Collect as many as you can. Lastly, you will collect Judas Coins. These are also found in red fountains and some are well hidden. For each 5 of these you collect, you get a bonus boost of power, although I didn't seem to note any real improvements. There are 30 in total and there is no extra bonus for getting them all.

Yes, there are more goodies. When you first start out all you have for a weapon are some worn out swords from the Crusade. So you need something better. When you first talk to the spirit of Beatrice she will give you her Holy Cross for protection. This is a powerful weapon, use it often by pressing the O button on the symbols pad. After you learn of Beatrice's fate, but before you descend in to hell, you will fight Death, and this is where you will get your main weapon, Death's Sythe and discard the worn swords. Those are your weapons for the whole game. However, there are more tricks up your sleeve, but you have to earn them. They are magic powers. There are 4 powers in total, and each one has a different purpose and power. First you will earn Righteous Path which is controlled by the Left Arrow key. If you have Mana and invoke this spell you charge the enimie and inflict serious damage. The second power you will earn is Lust Storm which is controlled by the down arrow key. If you have Mana and invoke this spell a ball of purple energy surrounds you and protects you from most attacking enimies. The third power you will earn is Sins Of The Father which is controlled by the right arrow key. If you have Mana and invoke this spell you will throw a golden cross that chases the enimie and hits them. Lastly, the fourth power you will earn is very powerful, its called Martyrdom and is controlled by the up arrow key. If you have health and Mana and you invoke this you will sacrifice some of both but all enimies near you
will be risen on a beam of light and smashed to the ground inflicting massive damage. Last in the goodies section are not really powers, but some hints, but they are very cryptic. Along he way an old friend has been summoned to come back from the afterlife to help as your guide. His name is Virgil. Each time you see him you should talk to him and receive his advice, and in the end he offers souls for your salvation. Always talk to Virgil and take the souls.

Last but not least is general controls. Dante as mentioned previously is controlled by the joystick nub, and a big thank you to the designers for their wisdom for making the game control that way as it should be. X button makes Dante jump, double X makes a jump on a jump to make
Dante go higher. The O button normally makes Dante use the Beatrice Cross, but it is also used an the Interact key. For example, if you some across a fountain, to break it you press the R key then you are prompted to repeatedly press O to pry open the fountain. The R key is used
often as the action key. You will use it to grappel, and invoke a final sequence. Once a larger enimie receives so much damage, you will see a prompt to use the R key. Move closer to the enimie and press the R and it will start the final sequence. This can be two different things. It can be the beginning of specific key presses needed to complete a battle, or it will invoke the Absolve/Redeem sequence. You can Absolve or Redeem both larger enimies, or the Damned which you will cross paths with in your travels. You have a key selection choice Square to Condemn or Circle to Absolve. If you condemn a soul they are punished and you receive Evil credits, if you Absolve the persons soul is saved and you receive Holy credits. Both are needed and as you reach different milestones, you get strength and power increases, you will need both so choose wisely and evenly throughout the game. Last on the controls are yielding your weapons, Circle key invokes Beatrice's Cross, Square is a light hit, and Triangle is a heavy hit. Once you achieve your first strength power up, you will receive combinations ability. 3 quick Squares or 4 quick Triangles will invoke these advanced attacks.

Overall the story line is interesting, well told and fun to play through. Many compare this game to God of War, it is not God of War, its not even close. Then only similarities are the way you control the character for both walking and fighting. God of War does not have the grappel
or rope swing abilities either. The story lines are completely different, the artwork & scenes are completely different, and the enimies are completely different. They are in fact two separate games. One last bit of information is on the length of the game. I found the game more than long enough. Some levels are very long and drawn out. There are some who claim to have played this game in like 3 hours or 10 hours. Horsehockey, there is no possible way for even the best gamer to complete this game in less than 25 to 30 hours, and that's if your good and playing the easiest difficulty level. So game length is not a problem, you will definately get your moneys worth from Dante's Inferno. I would highly recommend this game to any PSP owners who are looking for a fantastic game that is challenging, yet winnable, and contains so many options, upgrades, enimies, weapons, a great story line, fantastic art work, excellent character controls, and incredible animations all in one neat package.","Dante's Inferno For PSP, One Of The Top Best Games For The Platform",1269993600,5,{'Platform:': ' Sony PSP'},

It connects just fine to the Mac via bluetooth, and there is no button that does not get detected and function just fine (including the joysticks).

Don't be fooled though, outside of OpenEmu, there was no game on my Mac that worked with it. Obviously it works great with iOS though and I definitely preferred it for that over other MFI controllers that I found.

Edit: I wanted to add that I have further tested this controller and it also works with the ""Dolphin"" Emulator (which runs GameCube games), except that it doesn't sense the start button. In case you're wondering, this doesn't work at all with the ""Boxer"" emulator (that's a DOS emulator for Mac).

Also, although this controller doesn't work with most regular Mac Games (including Steam games), you can make it work with many games by using a program called ""Joystick Mapper"" or something similar. If you go that route, you can remap the inputs to read as keyboard inputs inside of your games, which still doesn't work in every game (plus the D-Pad and Start Button aren't picked up at all by that program), but it certainly extends the usefulness and capabilities of this controller.",Works Great with OpenEmu,1487462400,2,,
5.0,False,"09 7, 2005",A18JOUVR7H8E9U,B00002STGD,Clay,"This game basicly goes like this. There are 6 worlds, two of which you have to unlock first. So you start out with 4 worlds, a grassy world, a lava world, a water world, and the icy world. There's no order on how you go to the worlds so you pick which world you go to. Each world has 4 levels level 1 is a normal stage level 2 is a semi boss stage level 3 is like level 1 but it's bigger and more complex and level 4 is the boss of the world. Once you beat the boss you beat the world. Beat all 4 of em to unlock the 5th world the Fortress. Once you get all the gold cards you get a new world I like to call the rainbow world;).

  But anyways bomberman is a game where you click a button and a bomb pops up right where your standing. You can either kick it at your enemy, throw it, or pump it up to make a big bomb which causes more damage than a normal bomb. Sometimes you have to do a tricky bomb jump puzzle which I still have trouble doing. This game can get complicated to so it's very tricky. Took me awhile to complete it so if you want a long game I think this is for you (espicially for the expert). I love the variety of enemies in the game. I woundn't call this a game for a begginer at all!

  I find it fun to look for body parts in this game. It's hidden AND I MEAN HIDDEN in each normal stage there is 4 of em. It's tricky to find so you need lots of luck to find em.

  I think that's all for this reveiw, in the end I hope you get it. Bomberman is a star in nintendo and your about to find out why I presume ;)",It's a classic,1126051200,,,

The value of this title is highly dependant on your history with it, more importantly your purchase history.  If you bought Continuum Shift, and the DLC characters, EXTEND adds one additional character.  If you skipped out on Continuum Shift  (or if you bought CS but no DLC), you're getting at least four new characters, which for this series, is a lot, considering the intricacies of each character.

The gameplay mechanics have also been revamped, and all the content from its console brethren remain intact.

So why the Vita version?  DAT SCREEN, that's why.  This game absolutely pops, and wouldn't you know, the d-pad on the Vita is excellent.  I can't believe it ... an excellent, out-of-the-box, no obtrusive adapter, d-pad on a portable device.

Here's a brief breakdown if you're a diehard fan of RF Guerrilla. The graphics are slightly better with an improvement in overall physics, movement and the lighting effects are fantastic. The controls have a more first-person shooter approach with excellent aiming and reticle (with an upgrade that you can see the enemies remaining life). Overall sounds are a HUGE improvement over Guerrilla with pounding shotgun blasts and tumbling concrete/twisted metal. The guns no longer sound like toys and the voice acting is on-par with Guerrilla (sounding like SyFy movies...lol). As for gameplay... well, here is where it changes. If you're a hardcore fan of the previous game and you want a complete overhaul... you will be disappointed. It's not open-world by any means and IMO it resembles Resistance 2/ Dead Space with it's linearity. But if you actually enjoyed those games and expected a fun sequel, you will LOVE this one!! Being linear gives it a more direct and powerful approach to actually using every weapon and strategizing an attack. The demo only shows you 1/10 of what you can do in this game but if you enjoyed it, you will have hours of entertainment with the full version.

Edit:
I have yet to beat the game because of the Infestation mode. It really brings a challenge to the gameplay and trying to beat 30 waves on all 10 stages (I think)... alone or online... is really fun. Also for those trophy hunters, this game is not impossible to platinum and looks quite enjoyable to achieve (Hit and Run with vehicle, Kill 5 aliens with one Impact).

After reading so many bad reviews, it's certain that a lot of people are obsessed with the idea that this is not a sand-box game... therefore, it sucks. Just play the game and stop judging for what it isn't and enjoy it for what it is.",Amazingly fun!!,1307491200,17,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

What I also said in that review, is that I like the THPS series a lot. Well, enough with the past ! That was months ago ! This is now ! Months ago, I've overheard from gamers that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 is about to come out, and the more I heard, the more I got excited. When I finally got a chance to see the first screens on several magazines, I was thinking about how well it would play when it releases. Finally, in the month of November, it finally saw the light of day on the PlayStation 2 game console. I got the chance to play it, and boy, I wasn't disappointed. Everything that I've come to expect in a Tony Hawk game, is all here. Good graphics, beautifully done soundtrack, improved skating physics, one good additional character (Bam Magera from the Jackass series) and perfect gameplay balance. The graphics are the best I've seen in years. This is the kind of eye candy you just can't throw away. Perfectly polished enviroments, nicely modeled characters, and streaming blood are something cool to look at. The controls are identical to that of the previous THPS games, but with new moves and a high extension of combos to pull out. Plus new codes are there for your skating pleasure. Not to mention, cool characters. Darth Maul is one of them (remember that freaky black and red dude from Star Wars Episode 1 ?). If you highlight Darth Maul, the skateshop owner will be choking by his force grab. The physics truly make sense. It shows that the skater can't always bail by hitting the ground with your back or the rest of your body. You can bail by landing on your feet. And if you're tired of seeing blood just fly and disappear from your mouth, you get to see blood streaks on the street each time you fall and drag your face on the concrete. OUCH !!! If you skaters or skater haters out there want a skateboarding game that makes more sense than its last two prequels, get Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3. This is no doubt, the best skateboarding game for the PS2. The new Gamecube owners should not feel discouraged, because pretty soon, Tony Hawk 3, will be coming to the Gamecube at the launch day of the system. To the gamers who already have the game, enjoy yourself and skate on !",This is the third time we went to the skatepark !,1005436800,,,

5.0,False,"07 29, 2012",A1F92EK0MUNOVR,B0091I20E6,Pecos Bill,"The question on your mind: Logitech G600 vs Razer Naga.

I've used both a fair amount and have to say G600, mainly for 1 feature which will seem really awkward at first but is quite nice once you get used to it: the extra button on top.

Typical hand configuration: index on left-mouse, middle finger on right-mouse, ring and pinky fingers steer the mouse.  With the G600, there's an extra button on the right side where your ring finger will rest and while it's pretty awkward at first, once you get used to it, it's a great use of a previously idle finger.  By default it acts as a special key, similar to ""shift"", which lets you get double function out of the mouse buttons -- so your thumb buttons can be F1-F12 normally or 1-0 while holding the extra mouse button.  I don't need THAT many buttons though so I mapped it to ""mouse 4"" and use that as push-to-talk in Teamspeak.

So for me the extra button on the ring finger answered the age old question of ""where do I put my push to talk key?""  You would like it to be somewhere that doesn't interfere with your normal button pushing during gameplay and the ring finger button does that nicely.  You just have to get used to steering your mouse with your pinky finger.

The thumb buttons are actually really awkward -- same for the Razer Naga.  No matter how much I use these mice I find it awkward to use the more than the first few buttons there.  I dunno, maybe it would come in time if I forced myself to use them, so I'm tentatively keeping my review at 5 stars on the notion that ""It's not you, G600, it's me.""  I do like the side buttons, I just can never figure a way to use more than a few of them in which case I could have just kept using my older Logitech mouse.

Anyway, I also pick the G600 over the Razer partially because I'm apparently turning into a Logitech fanboy.  I had the Razer Nostromo keypad but switched to the Logitech G13 because it has more keys.  I also have the Logitech G35 headset.  The ""Logitech Gaming Software"" integrates all 3 devices under one roof, which is really nice (older Logitech mice had their own separate software but the G600 is incorporated into the Gaming Software app, letting you configure all of these devices in one shiny interface).

As usual, the Gaming Software makes it easy to rebind all of those mouse keys to be whatever you want -- or at least, you can bind them all to a keystroke.  For whatever reason, you cannot create macros for these buttons as you can for the G13 keypad, although as far as I know no other mouse out there supports macro buttons either, and I don't have a use for it anyway since I can just use the G13 for macros.

Anyway, good mouse, lotta buttons, expect to spend serious time getting used to it.",G600 vs Razer Naga,1343520000,,"{'Color:': ' White', 'Package Type:': ' Standard Packaging'}",

Socom 3 is the first Socom game I have played and I got to say its quite enjoyable. Its obvious the developers poored a lot of time into this game and it works and looks great.

The missions are varied,fun and can be a challenge. There is a great selection of weapons and you can even drive vehicles and change the position on the vehicle you want to be. Say for instance if you want to man the gun mount on the back of a vehicle. One thing I was surprised about the online community is still pretty large and when I got on there was over 900 people playing in varied rooms. The biggest downer was getting things set up and I am not for sure why but I had troubles getting my account to register. I only got in on a few games and I did not experience any lag. The hard part is entering a game room. You might be asking yourself why. I am not sure myself to be honest. Either the games I was entering on were either over or when I got in they were close to being over. Some required passwords. Also a lot of them require map packs to be purchased which is fine. I am not going to invest in any map packs because I do not play the ps2 much online.

The graphics are a real treat on the eyes even on the aging ps2. Fire effects are quite nice and the character models look pretty sharp. The CGI cutscenes are well animated and have a life all there own. The sound is pretty good also. Controls work really well. My only gripes were my squad at times either did not do what I told them or they would get hung up on a wall or building. Whether the developers were lazy or did not have time to fix this portion of the game I do not know. There was also a bit of slowdown in places but it was few and far between.

It is really hard not to recommend Socom 3. It is a great game that really does the majority of things right. My only real gripe is when my squad decides to be stupid and get hung up walls or buildings. Other than the few gripes I have this is truly a top tier game. Granted the ps2 is nearing the end of its lifespan its hard to argue the fact it was one of the greatest systems of all time and this game is shining example of the sheer quality of not only the system but the games as well.

They got their wish.  (Here I'll say I actually liked Assassin's Creed and Watch Dogs, but I cannot deny the sequel is far superior).

There is a twist of humor here.  There are a lot of options to get through a mission.  There are many side quests, and you can cause a lot of trouble.

For interface, it's by and large the same fare you're used to from Ubisoft.  You have an indicator to follow.  It tells you how far your destination is.  All that.  You can sneak up on guards and take them out.  Or you can sneak past them.  You can hack machines to lead them into traps.  You can hack phones or traffic lights or whatever for distraction.  There are a lot of options.

I found the story compelling enough for a game (or even a movie; it was really good) and the gameplay especially excellent.

5.0,False,"11 10, 2008",A2Q2A6JKY95RTP,B0016GABR4,Raul G.,"MotorStorm Pacific Rift has roared it's way into stores in perhaps one of the most crowed points in gaming in recent memory. Huge titles like Resistance 2, Gears of War 2, Little Big Planet, Fable 2 and many others all released around the same time as MS:PR. Sadly because of poor timing many will probably delay purchasing this game or end up skipping it altogether. Don't be one of those people and miss out on a terrific game!

MS:PR is a true sequel to the original breakout smash success. Capitalizing on all the experience from the first game, Evolution Studios returns with a bigger, better experience in MS:PR. Everything about the original MotorStorm has been improved, polished and soiled with mud.

The game features a more varied landscape than the simple desert setting of the original MotorStorm. Now players can select from 16 levels broken across four zones: Earth, Water, Fire and Air. As you can guess from the names, each features tracks dealing with the respective element. Levels vary from lush tropical jungles to simmering calderas to edge of your seat racing on the lip of a mountainous course. The track designs are amazing and conducive to white knuckle racing the series is known for.

Graphically few racing games shine as bright as MS:PR. Sure it may not be a photo realistic journey like GT5 Prologue. But then again GT5P doesn't have half the personality MS:PR has. The graphics in MS:PR are amazing. From levels which are both beautiful and grimy at the same time to detailed vehicles and impressive particle effects, the game has it covered.

Speaking of vehicles, MS:PR maintains the selection of Motorcycles, ATVs, Buggies, Rally Cars, Racing Trucks, Mudpluggers, Trucks and adds Monster Trucks to the fold. Somehow Evolution has managed to maintain balance throughout the classes and a slow moving Monster Trucks can (if raced correctly) maintain and beat a rally car. The game just works.

Major improvements to the single player offline mode feature a more diverse level set that spans 8 difficulty levels - or tickets as they're known in MotorStorm. As you progress through the tickets you'll unlock in game rewards such as vehicles paint schemes, driver skins and extras like concept drawings and behind the scenes movies. The game also fully takes advantage of Sony's trophy system and features 50 trophies to earn.

Anyone who played the original MS will probably recall the soundtrack that featured bands like Queens of the Stone Age, Wolfmother and Monster Magnet. While somewhat limited in song count the songs in the game fit the gritty racing perfectly. MS:PR continues the hard rock trend the original set and thankfully expands the track listing. While I found the selection of songs to be good, I can't help but miss hearing classic songs from the original game.

If I had to pick one element of MS:PR that is a bit disappointing I would pick the online racing portion. While certainly not bad, a few bad design choices keep the online mode from being great. The primary problem is that user options are extremely limited. You're allowed to select either a ranked or unranked match. After each race you're booted back out to the lobby to receive rank points and then have to select either a ranked or unranked match again. You can create a custom match and select your favorite tracks and vehicles, however, the matches are unranked and will not count toward your online rank. The online portion of the game is just a bit cumbersome and should give users the ability to create custom ranked races. To it's credit the game does implement a buddy system that will pair you with friends playing the game. Hopefully Evolution will hear the fans and patch the game to improve the online racing.

All in all MS:PR is an excellent game and a must have for PS3 race fans!",Arcade Racing At It's Finest,1226275200,6,,

The fact that you move your body to control the game differentiates it from all other gaming systems. But that's just the beginning. The Nintendo Wii is designed for a different kind of gamer. Games for the Wii are often more family-friendly and often they encourage group play. Games like Wii Sport, for example, let you play tennis by yourself or with a friend, and the let you compete to see who can score the highest in bowling. While other gaming systems concentrate on shoot `em ups and role-playing games for serious adult gamers, the Wii system is designed with everyone in mind, young and old.

The Nintendo Wii gaming system is very easy to set up. One small problem we encountered is the unit's tendency to overheat. I highly recommend buying a cooling unit to go with your Nintendo Wii. (We have yet to find a good charging station for the Wii-motes, as they are called. The Wii-motes eat up batteries very quickly, so this would be a great thing to have. The trouble is finding one.)

Of course, a gaming system is nothing without the right games to play on it. A few of our favorites include Wii Fit, Animal Crossing, Karaoke Revolution, Guitar Hero, Lego Indiana Jones, and Raving Rabbits TV Party. Everyone has his or her personal favorite, but we have yet to find anyone who doesn't want to play a game on our Wii: from the kids to the grandparents, and everyone in between.

Of course one of the most incomprehensible things about the Wii, is that the system which is better --for most people--than all the other gaming systems on the market, actually costs less. If you want a gaming system the entire family will enjoy, I recommend the Wii. I think you'll love it as much as we do.",Wii love it!,1248134400,4,{'Color:': ' White'},

So I bought it not expecting too much (considering that I was getting a game and accessory for such a good price) and was really blown away by the addictiveness of the game and the ease of use of the zapper.  I enjoyed playing target practice with Link - in addition to what you are meant to shoot, there are also different things in the stages that you can get points for and are fun to shoot. more hits in a row means multipliers (x1, x2, x3) and it really starts to add up.  The game is challenging, too and you need 20,000 points in each stage to be able to move up with a bronze medal. 40,000 points gives you a silver medal and 60,000 gives you a gold. This gives it more replay value and makes me want to continue to challenge myself as long as I still have gold medals to win.

5.0,False,"11 19, 2005",A2582KMXLK2P06,B00004SVR9,Bryan,"This is not your ordinary household puffball.  This is one bad son of a gun.  Sure, you think he's adorable and you want to cuddle him.  But be warned: many people think the same way about koala bears.  And what happens when you try picking one of those up?  That's right.  And the same thing might happen to you with Kirby.

Kirby is one dangerous boy/man/puffball/lady whatever.  You should know just by looking at him that he's capable of something angry.  Oh sure, he's cute and cuddly on the outside but on the inside it's a whole other story.  He's a vicious creature.  You think you know him... you don't.  What would possess Nintendo to create such a monster?  Maybe revenge, for players everywhere getting angry whenever they lose a life playing one of their games (such as the hardest setting of Star Fox or the Japanese version of Super Mario Bros. 2) and therefore throwing their controller in anger and breaking it.  But then Nintendo would be making money that way when players return to buy another controller, so Kirby's creation must be some kind of secret Nintendo undercover behind closed doors genius operation.

Think about it. Kirby was meant to fade away with time.  His popularity was meant to hang around for a couple years, and then when the NES went out and the Super NES came in, Kirby should have disappeared.  But he didn't.  He continued to appear in new adventures with Nintendo's new video game systems and he became a survivor, and he's still going strong 15 years later.  It wasn't supposed to happen.  How could it happen?  Nintendo is about ready to release another video game system.  I think next year.  Will Kirby make an appearance on that system?  I think he will.  It gives me chills to think about the things Kirby is capable of.  He won't go away.  This wasn't meant to happen.  Nintendo created a monster and now it's out of control.

So as you see Kirby is not such a friendly puffball.  It's all a disguise.  Nintendo knows it, and you should know it too.  Damn you Nintendo!

As for this game, it's a lot of fun.  It's Kirby before he turned into a monster children the world over became frightened by.  Do not make the mistake of thinking he's innocent.  Buy this game anyway, and remember a time when Kirby was friendly and lovable and gave video game players a pleasant after taste.  He's Kirby, he packs a mean punch, and I do mean mean.

This isn't a very expensive game so you should buy it.  No one thought it would happen, but Kirby lives on.  Pick up this adventure to return to an innocent time.

Now for some other thoughts.  This game is somewhat unusual in that it doesn't feel like a platform game and feels more like a party game of sorts.  This is because Kirby has so many moves in his arsenal and so many techniques required to advance to the next part of the game that each and every level feels remarkably different.  No I mean, not just different in design (you have forest, castle and ship levels) but Kirby HIMSELF is different.  He does different things each level.  This is nothing like Mario who normally spends his time jumping on goombas and koopa shells every game, or Donkey Kong who throws barrels and collect bananas, or Samus who shoots space pirates and collects data.  Kirby's different in that he can suck in enemies and use them as projectiles to spit them out at enemies as an attack method which was an original idea back in the early 90's.  He can breathe fire, ice, float around, turn into a tire, turn into spikes, turn into a laser beam shooting spaceship, use invincibility, swing a sword and so many other things.  The variety is different for every level.

The enemy variety is insane too.  You have spikey jellyfish creatures, monkeys walking on balls like they're part of a circus act, deformed and oddly designed regular animals such as rabbits, frogs, bees, porcupines and rabbit-shaped pink birds.  Seriously, what ARE these creatures?  At least they're highly original whatever they are.  You also have cannons and cannonballs, mushroom-shaped foes, shy guy-like foes riding down on parachutes, spinning cylinder stationary things, and armored sword swinging bad guys.  An INSANE amount of variety!

The boss fights are pretty good, but I'm totally surprised the very last boss fight consists of three VERY different missions, each one providing just as much intensity as the others.  The second battle in particular in outer space blasting stars at a floating planet is the most memorable one for me.  The levels themselves are pretty basic but the game is surprisingly HUGE for an NES game, featuring over 20 levels!  Wow!  This game takes a couple hours to complete even if you're doing particularly well (and this game offers a pretty high challenge so you won't be blowing through it as easily as say, a Super Mario Bros. or Metroid game).  The music ranges from mediocre and annoying to REALLY good in a couple spots (such as the Grape Garden stage- I LOVE that sad little memorable piece of music!)

Another aspect of the levels is that you need to find and jump on top of these big switches which opens up new areas of the game.  Pretty cool concept.  Also some of the mini games are weird such as standing in a boxing ring and ducking to avoid the bombs to rack up points, having a wild west showdown, and the one where you have to grab Kirby items with a hook inside a toy machine (I can't remember what these actual machines are called- there's an exact name for them).  These aren't particularly fun games but nice additions I suppose.

Overall, great game.  Sometimes the cuteness factor rubs me the wrong way and the platforming aspect seems to take a backseat so Kirby's huge variety of moves can take center stage which isn't always a good thing because sometimes the game feels like it offers *too* much and loses its compactness as a result.  But hey, Earthworm Jim is guilty of the same excessive variety type of level design and I love that series.

5.0,True,"12 17, 2013",A7H7DXG5XX4LT,B00E1L785E,Haunted Spider,"I purchased this headset with the intent to use it for playing on an Xbox One.  I previously owned a 360 and know that these are designed for that system, but there is an upgrade coming, so let me explain.

As a former Turtle beach and Tritton user, I wanted something better this time around. My Trittons only lasted 6 months before the mic failed. The Turtle beaches were good but cumbersome and not great to wear for long periods. They felt cheap and were cheap. The quality was lacking and not what I wanted.

Enter Polk Audio to the scene. Polk partnered with Xbox to create game headphones. As nice as that is, it isn't why I chose them. Polk Audio themselves have been around for a long time and have always made good quality products. Knowing this I started my research. Upon handling them, they are very well made, feel heavy enough to not feel cheap, but sit extremely comfortably on my head. The lack of the mic boom is great as it is not in the way, just a simple push of the button and the mic drops down sort of like a blue tooth, not the boom style. The ear cups are comfortable and there are no pressure points so far. The sound is fantastic as expected by Polk.

I found that online, there is very minimal information on these headsets and on the new 4 shot headsets. I didn't understand how these hooked to the xbox 360 or how the new 4 shot version was different. I called customer support several times and I will share what I learned as well as what I also found out when I got the new headset in the mail today.

The 4 shot and Melee are one in the same as far as the headphones are concerned. The Headphones are a stand alone piece of equipment. You plug in one jack to them, one single wire, not several. I originally thought there were two like my other headsets. One going to the controller and one going to the xbox to power it. This is not the case. There is a single cord that runs to the xbox. It splits on both ends sort of.

At your controller, the audio mixer is there, which allows you to mute the mic, adjust the volume of the game, and adjust the volume of the mic. It also allows for some optimization modes for different game styles like racing or shooting. The cord passes through this mixer and goes to your headphones. This is why only one cable goes to the headphones as it is powered and given sound through the singe cable.

At the xbox end, it goes through a DSP amplifier which splits to an optical out cable and a USB plug. This is how your game sound and the headphones are powered.  What this also means is that you can plug the optical out cable and USB into the back of an Xbox one and it plays the sound as it should with the correct directions of noise in each ear cup. This is a big plus as it means they work right now with the Xbox One, just not as a communicator with the Mic. I plugged them in, turned on Ghosts and played a trial round on a local connection game. The sound was great and exactly what I expected it to be. I can turn the volume up and down with the audio mixer and adjust it to my liking. I just can't talk to anyone in lobby with them, but I can use the Kinect for that for now.

The Mic is not functional due to Microsoft making the new plug in port to the controller different than the original 360 controller. No headset is currently functional due to this, no matter the brand. But Polk is releasing an adapter after the first of the year, I think in February, which allows the Polk Melee to attach to the controller and equip the mic for functionality. Every other manufacturer is trying to do the same. But the Polk adapter does more than that. The adapter gets rid of the need for a power source through the USB port and the optical out is eliminated. The new puck or adapter uses the full capability of the controller. The controllers are designed to push enough energy out to power the speakers in each ear cup as well as tell directionality of shots, movements, etc, so you get the surround sound you want to be immersed in a game. Essentially what this means is that the headset with the adapter is now a true 4 shot headset, wireless to the system, and fully functional with all the Xbox Ones capabilities.

Next is the functionality with something other than your Xbox. These come with a cable, which is a standard audio jack for most if not all phones. It has a built in button in the line that allows you to answer phone calls if you like, or you can use them to just listen to music. Your phone powers them just fine but for the love of God, turn down the volume before you put them on....

When I put the headphones on, the first thing I noticed was the sound dampening. It is like putting on a set of ear muffs designed to reduce sound when operating a lawnmower or something of the like. These are not advertised as this but they certainly do muffle all noise around you. The Trittons and Turtle Beaches neither one did this (3 different styles of turtles over 4 years) This allows for music or game sound to be set lower as you are not trying to drown out other noise.

So if you have a headset and you like it, keep it and wait until after the first of the year and adapters for other makers are coming out too. If you have both systems, an xbox 360 and the one, then this may the headset for you as you can use it flawlessly with both systems.

If you only have the one and want to get this or the 4 shot, it will come down to price and timing. When I bought this set it was 147 and has since gone up to the Manufacture's recommendation to 199. I am loving how these work and am glad I purchased them now.",Awesome headset for gaming and general use,1387238400,57,{'Color:': ' Black'},

I pulled the trigger and picked up the game while it was on sale, and am extremely glad I did so. The game is still as enjoyable as ever, and with the time elapsed since my last playthrough I feel like the story is still fresh and exciting. The improvements made by Square Enix are extremely welcome. The graphical overhaul makes the game look amazing, even at 12 years old. The ability to fast forward (at either 2x or 4x) at the push of a button is great for getting through some of the more dragged-out sequences, especially grinding for loot or experience. The fast-forward works surprisingly well in tandem with the semi-automated gambit battle system, as you can carefully craft your battle plan through setting up gambits and let the characters take care of combat after that. I am especially grateful that the game now contains an auto-save feature. I have vivid memories of frantically searching for save points when I had to stop playing the game, or leaving it running if I couldn't find one but had to leave.

When I first played this game on Xbox I wasn't very impressed. It was okay, but nothing special compared to newer PC combat games. The thing that annoyed me the most was the basic level design (which hasn't really improved on the PC) and the console controls. Well, Halo plays quite well on the PC and I personally think the graphics are ""somewhat"" improved.

I've read a lot of reviews on Amazon talking about people having trouble playing Halo at anything other that the lowest quality settings, but I haven't had ANY of those problems. I'm on a P4 2.8GHz machine with 1Gig of RAM and a 128MB ATI graphics card. Maybe some of the people having problems either don't have enough RAM or have buggy machines or cheap PCs they bought from Dell, but I have NO PROBLEM running this game at 1024x768 at AT LEAST 30fps and all the detail settings to high.

While I can't argue that there is a whole lot to do right now, by October that will change. Over the summer 2 or 3 large updates are releasing that will add new enemies, ships and other stuff like bug fixes. Another thing people complain about a lot. I personally have only ever experienced one bug. It's annoying but not game breaking. One of my friends I play the game with has a bugged client, so when we play our instruments, neither of us can here the other. That's the only bug I've experienced. The content that is in the game has thus far given my friends and I hours of fun. There are three alliances, and you purchase voyages from and level up in each alliance. The alliances are The Gold Hoarders, who will give you voyages of two kinds. The first is an X-marks-the-spot voyage, where you will receive one or more maps of different islands throughout the fairly sized map, (which will be expanded over the summer) and you have to navigate to the islands and find where the x's are located and dig up treasure. The treasure chests range from Castaway chests, worth around 100 gold to the Hoarders, to the more rare chests like the Chest of Sorrows, which will cry and flood your ship if you aren't careful, worth around 2000 gold. The other type of voyage is a riddle voyage, where you travel to a random island and solve various written riddles to find buried treasure. The second alliance is the Order of Souls. The Order will give you voyages in which you will have to venture to various islands and defeat skeletal pirate crews and claim the Captains' skulls. The skulls range from the Foul Bounty Skull, worth around 100 gold to the Order, to the Villainous Bounty Skull, worth around 1000 gold. The final alliance, the Merchant Alliance, are essentially the goods traders. Upon purchasing a voyage from them, you will be given a list of goods you will need to obtain and deliver to a specific outpost by a certain date. The tasks range from catching animals like various types of chickens, pigs, and snakes, each fetching a different price, to filling crates with different goods like bananas, cannonballs, or wooden planks. Beyond voyaging, there is still a lot to do. You can battle other players and their ships, or use your gold to upgrade your clothing, weapons, equipment, and ships. All of the upgrades are aesthetic, making Sea of Thieves a skill based game, which adds a fun amount of challenge to the battles and voyaging. There is no way to have an advantage over other players. You can shoot each other out of cannons, fight the kraken, and more. Overall, Sea of Thieves is a really fun game to play with your friends, (though you can play solo) and I highly recommend buying it for yourself.",Much Better Than It's Made Out To Be.,1526256000,,{'Platform:': ' Xbox One Digital Code'},

For $20, there is no other game on the planet that can touch the epic feel and engrossing gameplay as Oblivion and it's expansions. I have played and re-played this game more times than I can remember, trying out different characters and taking things in different directions. It just never gets old! Plug in some of the player-developed modules and you literally have a game that never ends.

Graphically, Oblivion is still gorgeous, even by today's standards. Controls, gameplay, character building, and customization are all first-class. The greatest thing about trying this game now is that, if you have a newer gaming PC, you can crank up the graphics settings and run the game all-out and you will be amazed with how great everything looks and how smooth it runs. When released, there were very, very few PC's that were capable of running the game at it's highest settings but now this is more easily achieved.

Regardless having just finished playing through the game twice - once on 'Spartan' (normal) difficulty and once on 'Titan' (hard) difficulty I feel that I'm better prepared to write a review on God of War 3.

God of War 3 picks up immediately where GoW 2 left off. So that's to say that the games are each direct sequels of one another. If you somehow missed out on either God of War 1 or 2 I highly recommend you pick up a copy of 'The God of War Collection' for the PS3. It's the HD remastering of the PS2 originals complete with all the bonus features, 720p - 60fps graphics and trophies packed on a single Blu-ray disc.

In GoW 3 Kratos is finally at full-scale war with Olympus. No more messing around with battles against minions - this time Kratos is after the very gods of Olympus themselves. The game picks up with Kratos and the Titans ascending Olympus and immediately throws the player into an epic battle against the god Poseidon. This is where GoW 3 will really shine - massive, multi-part boss battles on a scale never really seen before in video games. If you're a fan of the previous games then you already have some sense of how far the series can take things - GoW 3 shatters that barrier and moves battles to new highs. The battle against Poseidon will leave you with your mouth open in awe. I don't want to get into too many more details about the story. I'll leave the spoilers out, but suffice to say that the story is satisfying and brings closure. The boss battles along the way are each unique and constantly offer something new and challenging.

The much lauded graphical power of the PS3 really shines in this game. You can tell Sony Santa Monica truly has a firm mastery of the hardware in the same way that developer Naughty Dog (Uncharted series) has. The graphics will not disappoint all but the most biased. Playing this game on my 65"" Panasonic plasma was a visual tour de force. My wife stopped on several occasions and even remarked at how incredible the game looked and she's not exactly a gamer.

The gameplay is exactly like the previous GoW games - best described as an action adventure, hack n' slash. I've heard the complaints about the game being a button masher and I would recommend anyone who is ""bored pressing buttons"" to try a higher difficulty setting. There is definitely more strategy in terms of the correct weapon choice and combo to use against particular enemies and combination's of different enemy types. Speaking of weapons Kratos has access to far more than just the Blades of Athena (Blades of Exile), but again I don't want to spoil anything. There are 4 main weapon types each with their own devastating combos.

While the game does not offer any online mode to speak of there is plenty of replay value in the form of different difficulty settings, trophies to collect, challenges also return and are as fun (and frustrating) as ever! Also making a comeback are collectibles in-game that unlock special abilities and costumes for use on later playthru's. GoW3 also features a unique and cool new feature, the Combat Arena. In this mode you can customize a fight selecting the difficulty the enemy types and the amount of enemies to fight. It's just a neat way of fighting your favorite or least favorite enemies. You can even enable cheats so you can punish those pesky Satyr's into submission when you get frustrated playing the game on 'Titan' difficulty.

Definitely a game I would recommend to just about anyone. As a side note, if you're a parent DO NOT buy this game for a child. It's extremely violent, full of gore and explicit scenes and features parts with female nudity. Other than that, play away and I hope everyone enjoys this game as much as I did!",5-STARS - GoW3 is a Must Own Title,1277856000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The way the music cues in at the perfect moments during mission adds gravity to the emotion the story creates.

All in all I lack to literary talent to give the story the credit it deserves without rambling so moving on to gameplay. Easy to pick up, hard to master, and yet surprisingly simple. Which saddens me somewhat I had hoped for a combat system as complex as Platinum Games' Bayonetta.

Shadow the Hedgehog. And honestly, I think this game is under-rated for one of two reasons. Guns and/or Curse words. I'll adress the second one now. Curse words have been used in Sonic media for some time on the Japanese side of the Pacific. Knuckles in Sonic Adventure, for instance, and Tails in the Japanese Sonic X series. If you will let that alone destroy a game, just like you would let eye color destroy a game, then you have no right to call yourself a Sonic fan. I myself don't exactly like how every freaking character shouts/says '-profanity-', but it doesn't lower the game itself.
Now, onto the real review.
-
Plot: Shadow the Hedgehog, who has released from a capsule from Eggman's base in Sonic Zeroes, wonders about who he is, having only a shard from a devastated memory to answer his question, because all of the other Sonic characters that also experienced the events of SAB2 are all being -profanity- and not bothering to enlighten him. Dramatic music plays, storm clouds gather, setting the game's dark mood, and a bunch of creatures drop onto the nearby city of Westopolis, destroying countless cars and raining 'lazars' onto the city while all of the citizens, somehow, are safe... Shadow remarks that he doesn't have time, an alien being approaches him, tells him about some promised time and how Shads needs to get the 7 Chaos Emeralds *That everyone wants and no body has*, then leaves. Shadow, having no one else to believe, goes off into Westopolis to try and start finding his answers. From there, he encounters Friend and Foe alike, he commits mass genocide/xenocide while snatching up Chaos Emeralds to try and find the answers of his past. What is the truth? YOU Decide...10 different times, and THEN the game will show you to be an idiot to believe any of those 10 as it NOW tells you the truth.
-

Controls: The simplicity/difficulty varies on familiarity with Adventure style play. You'll find this very similar to SAB2/SADX controls.
L and R triggers: Never used them in this game...
A Button: Jump. Tap again to preform a homing attack.
B Button: Punch. Press twice for double punch. Press three times for double punch and jumping frontkick. When holding gun, this button SHOOTS! By spamming this button, Shadow becomes a trigger-happy hedgehog.
X Button: Action Button. Spindash and Light speed attacks. You can also pick up objects with this button and throw them with this button. Lastly, when holding a weapon and standing over another weapon, you can switch guns.
Y Button: You can toss your gun carelessly with this button. And you can Chaos Control with this button to cut out a good-sized chunk of the level and Chaos Blast with this button to destroy just about everything in a 10 meter radius of the destructive hedgehog.
Main Control Stick: Moves the character, obviously.
C Stick: Camera
Z Button: Nothing
-

Gameplay: 22 levels, and around 20 of them are like the Sonic/Shadow levels of SAB2. So if you liked Sonic and Shadow's gameplay in the two Adventure games, most of this will be fun for you if you don't mind using guns. For levels, you are given two or three missions. One of the missions, usually the neutral but sometimes dark or hero, is for Shadow to tear through the level as fast as possible and get the Chaos Emerald. Dark is usually to kill X Number of GUN Soliders *As in, shoot their brains out or smash them to death*, or some other mission that Eggman/Black Doom tells you to do. Hero is usually to kill X Number of Black Arms or to do whatever mission that the Sonic cast can't do *Such as Amy or Charmy* or won't do *Such as Sonic because he becomes lazy in this game and won't do crap to help Shads*. The biggest plus this game has over almost any other Pre-Unleashed game is that when you get hit/shot, you will not lose all of your rings. Only 10 of them. That has saved me countless times, where I would have died had this been Sonic Adventure 2. For instance, at the third computer in Final Fortress, up to six Heavy Dogs will try to kill you. Lastly, killing a certain number of Black Arms/Prototype Chaos/Egg Pawns get your Hero meter filled up, covering Shadow with a blue aura and allowing you CHAOS CONNTTTROOOOLLL through a size-able chunk of the level. Kill enough GUN Soldiers/Egg Pawns or Destroy enough crap and you get Chaos BLAST, which lets you destroy things in a certain radius.
-

Replay-ability: For me, the game SHINES here. The varying missions are challenging, but with only a few aside, many of them are fun to do. A rank all of Shadow's missions and boss battles, and you earn a Super-hard mode of all the levels, which really puts your Chaos-Mastering skills to the test! Many people don't like the game because their isn't a tangible award, like SA2 had, but they fail to realize that the game itself should be good enough that such an award is un-nesscary. Also, to go through the level, looking for five special keys that unlock a secret door in the each level adds to the replay value, as the keys can appear in the strangest places...

Multiplayer: The game lacks with Multiplayer. Although I enjoy it a lot, there is not much of a choice. You can play as Real Shadow, a Gold and black Shadow, and four Shadow Androids. Then you choose one of three levels, or all three, and try to kill your opponent. You have 10 minutes to do so. You can also work up a Chaos Blast in Multiplayer, but as there are no visible Dark Meters, you don't know how or when you'll get it. It doesn't sound like much, and it isn't much. The only other thing is that some hero characters can be controlled by a 2nd player in 1P mode. Sonic, Amy, Knuckles, and I think Vector...not sure of the others.

I always find it fascinating where one person says they hate game X because the song set sucks - and then another person says they adore game X because the song set list is to awesome!! We all have very different tastes in music. It is well worth it to look at the song list for yourself and see if the songs appeal to you or not. No game will ever have 100% songs you love - but there should at least be a few that you're going to enjoy playing.

I have several DDR games and I use SuperNova 2 as my ""warm up set"" before I move on to the other games. So when I go downstairs to where my DDR mat and such are set up, I'll start with this SuperNova 2 game. It tends to have slower songs that get my muscles and legs warmed up. So it has Unbelievable, Got to Be Real and Take On Me (with the actual music video). These are all relatively slow but are fun to dance to (for me!) and get me moving. After I do two sets of these three, I pop out the DVD and move on to the actual high energy songs I plan on playing with for the afternoon. Then when I'm winding down I'll go back to these to end up with.

What if you hate the 3 songs I mentioned? Well luckily for you there are tons more :) So what one person likes, another person hates. It's the way these games work.

The graphics are certainly nice enough for a PS2 level system, and I've played it on everything from a little laptop to a bit high definition TV. It works fine in all situations. Right now I have my laptop set up in the basement with the mat and I can see the arrows and moves quite easily on it.

I have played with workout mode, but really it's easier for me to just hit 'sort' a few times to get them into the most-played order, play through the few songs I want to warm up with, and then move on.

I like the steps on the songs I play, but again your mileage may vary depending on the songs you tend to play with.

In general I suggest you look through the full song list and if you see things here you like - enjoy! If the songs just don't appeal to you, there are certainly enough other DDR games for you to choose from. For me this is a keeper!",One of My Keepers,1205452800,3,{'Edition:': ' Game'},

Mullins,"Bioware has the Midas touch, Baulder's Gate, Torment, Knights of the Old Republic, Mass Effect, they pretty much own the American RPG market and for good reason. Have they struck gold again with Dragon Age? I think so. Dragon Age is another work of art and stands equally with its older brothers. The story is a bit cliche, but told so well and with such polish that you don't notice much. The character development has much in common with Mass Effect. You will spend a good deal of time walking around camp and talking with your fellow party members, gaining trust of finding love. The NPC characters themselves are very well detailed and with rich personalities and back stories.

The intro to each character, which is where the Origin in Dragon Age: Origin comes from, are nice treat. I wish that they had a little more to do with the progression of the story. While its true that you may meet some people from your origin story and there are some consequences it doesn't have the impact I'd expect.

The AI for both enemy and ally is pretty good but does stutter at times. This pays off a great deal on consoles where the ability to micromanage your party isn't as easy as on PC. I was able to play through the majority of the game allowing my party to operate on their AI behavior. To that extent you are able to customize response and actions for your various party members which really helps.

Graphic and gameplay wise Dragon age looks and plays very much like Mass Effect. It is polished and well done but not the 'next generation' engine some people were expecting. There are occasional graphic and gameplay glitches during some transitions from fights to cut scenes but nothing game breaking. The load times on the PS3 can be a bit annoying and takes a little longer than I'd expect. The inventory system is a bit annoying and could have been better but really I am nit picking.

All said and done I spend almost 30 hours straight over a long weekend playing through this and saw probably less than half of avaliable quests. There is a ton of gameplay available for the money and even more with the promise of more downloadable content. I think this is another winner for Bioware and if you enjoyed any of their previous work you will love Dragon Age Origin.",Baulder's Gate Goth Cousin,1259539200,2,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",

The story behind Little Nemo is that Nemo is on an adventure through slumberland.  With eight levels each one getting progressivly harder.  Nemo is armed with Candy which can stun his foes and get certain animals on his side.  From the Frog who increases his jumping ability to the Gorilla who is a powerhouse the game featured many things.  Within each level (outside of the last) you had to gather a set # of keys in order to escape the level.  In the final level Nemo, now armed with the Kings magic septer must square off against the Nightmare king and his villians.

Codemasters racers have always had better physics, game-play, and handling than the Gran Tourismo series. Sorry to say it but every game in the entire Gran Turismo series is just plain boring. Codemasters career based game structure always ensures you are challenged and the gameplay is fast and fun. Grid is no exception - they've significantly raised the bar on this game. I'd bet anything that GT won't come anywhere close to this for game-play when they finally get their act together and release the game.

The instant replay is an amazing addition to the game-play. Not many other reviewers describe it here so I will do just that. You can read the other reviews for other features. The concept is that you get a limited number of chances to rewind time back to up to ~20 seconds and continue playing from that point. It's a fantastic feature that lets you analyze where you went wrong, see it again and again by quickly zooming back and forth in time, then start racing again it from a selected point back in time and hopefully get that corner right this time!

You might think the flashback feature is unrealistic, but in fact it adds a ton of strategy to the game. If you have enough replays left you can really push it towards the end of a race. If you wipe out, you can try again. Make sure you have replays left though! It sucks when you wipe out and realize you've used them all up! The problem with racing games has always been that you're obviously not in a life threatening situation so you don't have anything to loose. You can replay each race over, crashing and burning in situations where you would be dead in real life. This makes setting the difficulty of the AI a problem. You either have the computer controlled racers race like their lives are at stake, in which case it's too easy to beat them by driving recklessly, or you design them to drive flat out without a care in the world, in which case the game becomes frustratingly difficult.
